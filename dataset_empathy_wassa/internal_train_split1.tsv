There had been several orangutans rescued from an illegal dealer. They were taken to a rescue center. The infant orangutan all of a sudden collapsed in her cage. She has meningitis which can be deadly for her. She is getting amazing care at this center though, so I sure hope she pulls through. I have no extra money right now but you can donate to this organization!	sadness	2	5	1	30	55000	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857

It is sad that they know how deadly and unsafe these worker conditions are but still have yet to close them. I am happy they are set to close around 1,000 but i think more has to be done. There should be a council and regulations set up like osha in the us to protect workers and make sure all precautions are being done to preserve human life. Now families are left without there sons fathers and incomes when they could have easily just shut this down. I hope for safer woring conditions in the future.

Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1	6	3	30	40000	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0

Hopefully more details will come out in future articles. The news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details.

Still, should he be charged with a felony?  My Granny Jones used to make turtle soup out of the snappers they fished out of her creek.  I guess the difference is he wasn't killing the turtle for food...But, a felony?	surprise	2	4	1	50	48000	5.5	5.0	5.0	6.0	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.714	4.143

""I just want to ask the security personnel who fired pellets at me what my fault was,"" Miss Mushtaq says, as she stands by the same window she was sitting at when pellets blinded her. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision. Nothing has worked so far, but she remains hopeful. Ms Mushtaq says she wanted to become a doctor before losing her vision. She brings out her text books to show me, and flips the pages though she cannot read them anymore.

Since Election Day, there have been more than 200 acts of election-related intimidation and harassment across the U.S., according to a survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center. People from all types of communities ― black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, Asian, queer people, women ― have been physically harmed, slandered with hate speech or been the targets of racist graffiti.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1	4	3	30	60000	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0

After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1	6	5	31	75000	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0

Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed?

For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality.

Cancer really does humble the soul into new places that one never thought possible to emerge stronger from feeling. It sounds like she faced it with a mask of strength at first.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714

The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.

Us as a society, we are taking advantage of the trees we have here. In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.	disgust	1	4	1	26	35000	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714

Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals.

Setting aside the absurdity of the media relaying a he said-she said moment with no relevance to the greater world beyond the individuals to whom it applies, it is terrifying to think how prevalent cancer is.	fear	1	4	1	39	48000	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999

We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	sadness	2	5	2	41	60000	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001

I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.

However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857

Imagine if you could go back home and go to sleep at halftime of the Super Bowl and then come back the next day and play the second half. Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously. When I watched Lebron crush the Raptors I was kind of curious as to how they slept knowing a game was coming up.

As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.	fear	2	6	1	32	68000	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0

""They couldn't open the back door so I kicked it down and they all came running out. ""It was one of the two: you get the people out or they're going to die."" Mr Nyok said there were three children among the passengers. Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said it was ""a very, very sad day for the council and the wider community"".

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

And yet we think it's fine to let refugees and immigrants go where they want, as if there aren't repercussions for that. There are repercussions for everything.  Migration changes habitats.  Change isn't inherently bad, but it's inherently different, and people don't like that.	Neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	226.0	48.0	1.0	train	225.0

My heart goes out to the person who worked hard to try to save its life and is grieving over the loss of that hard battle. As a wildlife rehabilitator I know the struggle all too well. I understand how it feels to forgo sleep and food because you are working to save an animal. It is painful. But if you can save even one, it will make it all worth it in the end.	sadness	2	6	1	26	47000	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0
