I'm not sure why he did what he did but he was obviously mentally ill and wasn't taking his medication. I believe friends had to have been helping him hide otherwise I don't know how he could have hidden so long otherwise. Anyways, incidents like this only makes them try to crack down harder on guns and our rights to bear arms, but this person was clearly mentally ill.	neutral	2	2	3	39	29000	7.0	7.0	5.0	7.0	7.0	4.857	2.143	4.857	4.857	82	713	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	2.649848993787957	2.771410582002813	medium	medium	An essay written by a 39 years old black or african american female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 29000$.

Someone thought it was new worthy to make the world aware that he and his wife got into a screaming match and she was afraid.  The truth is, no one but their family knows what's really going on.  His wife could be a very dramatic person.  She could be giving him a hard time.  While domestic violence and emotional abuse should never be tolerated, we should leave people to deal with their own screaming matches.	neutral	5	7	3	34	100000	5.5	4.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	1.857	2.857	4.143	86	619	0.1219512195121951	0.0975609756097561	0.1219512195121951	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.1463414634146341	0.1463414634146341	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0434782608695652	2.782535823378202	2.7441271461235446	low	medium	An essay written by a 34 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

I can understand to some Trump represents the return of jobs and other industry, but to others he is a symbol of hate. I know you voted for him and I know that you are not racist, but can you see how much this has torn the country apart? We both know that the country was not already united as one, but this has made it worst. I do not see it getting any better anytime soon.

I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

I think it's a few years old because it says the protests have been going on for five months, and I started following the Standing Rock case A LOT longer than five months ago. Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned.

So civilian casualties are starting to rise as Iraqi forces push into Mosul. The vehicles screeched into the small field hospital on the outskirts of Mosul carrying desperate loads: soldiers injured in battle as well as men, women and children caught in the crossfire of Iraq’s war against the Islamic State. Now you know me. I would be in terrible trouble this is not a way of life. Why are were even in war. Why harm our children. This has saddened me to no end.

I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too. Our country deserves that!	neutral	1	6	1	31	50000	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	125	602	0.2758620689655172	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.2068965517241379	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.0	2.7489341081556287	2.7750575351582545	low	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy.

It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.  I hope something is done soon and I'll send you a link to the article.	sadness	2	2	1	32	50000	7.0	6.5	1.0	7.0	4.5	4.428999999999999	4.143	4.428999999999999	5.0	110	511	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.125	0.0454545454545454	2.7362472132521973	2.5652156466863123	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 50000$.

Sadly the US has moved down in the list behind all of the major European countries. I guess the number of women working in senior positions is shrinking. There is also a decline of women in the labor force. But there is evidence that the education gender gap is shrinking, so there are more women educated. It just seems that more women are choosing not to work.	sadness	2	5	1	30	55000	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	79	106	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.46893929319281	2.4529082285191683	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000$.

We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.

		44	1.5	1.5			All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	108	1871	0.18	0.18	0.02	0.02	0.06	0.08	0.22	0.14	0.08	0.02	0.0454545454545454	2.667612087015073	2.756443482830526	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

However, some aspects of life–like habits, even smartphones, and stress in work–affect our sleep cycles. A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1	6	1	46	240000	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	104	728	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000$.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned.

It's one thing when it's to an accident or disease or something, but to know they died in a fire and you couldn't get them out... I'd feel so guilty.

It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals.

The problem with all of this is the country of Syria must come to a place where they take back what has been taken from them. But you know why they can't? The citizens were not allowed to be armed and any weapons they have now have been supplied by us and the allies.

The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.  Awful to live with.	neutral/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	143	2416	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.1923076923076923	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.6821772746555674	2.552187431598643	medium	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	141	425	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.0416666666666666	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.

There were three U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base, fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base. I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol. They have had serious problems in Jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossing their border. Jordan is and has been a significant U.S. ally in the war against ISIS and I can only hope that this incident is isolated and not part of a bigger problem.

I mean, how terrible it must be!  Though details aren't completely clear, it sounds as if the son had some issues that weren't completely dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad.  How terrible to have to carry this with him the rest of forever.  It would break my heart in two.  I hope he gets deep counseling for his grief and guilt.

He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through.

I think we need to do something about the plastic issue, maybe starting by cutting down on all the plastic we use.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	89	2299	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.0666666666666666	2.911653225527878	2.7785514452149287	medium	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

There is a huge number of deaths due to hazing in Indonesia. All driven by over-industrialisation and hunger of profits. Governments and scientists should do more to prevent these kinds of deaths: at least to have certain warning systems installed. Also, natural disasters such as hails and typhoons can wreck a havoc in peoples’ lives. Now I have second thoughts about traveling to South Pasific islands.

Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all. In fact, Germany is in rapid negotiations with Afghanistan and other countries to repatriate those who have fled.

It's tough because you want to thelp them, but with such limited information, it's hard to do so.	neutral	1	5	1	31	82000	3.5	2.5	2.0	4.5	5.0	3.571	2.286	1.857	2.0	80	2369	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.709948026345662	2.5247882498958965	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 82000$.

It was stated that the dog has been working with the police officer for quite some time so i'm sure that they had some sort of bond.

But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .	neutral	1	6	1	41	37500	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	125	557	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1351351351351351	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6932243424568827	2.65952896669124	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 37500$.

The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?

Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	141	676	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

I don't know if you know, but some people value rhino horns more than the beautiful creatures they come from. I don't believe the initial attack on Hope was responsible for her death, but it brought this beautiful creature into the spotlight, and I'm very glad for hearing of her story and saddened by her passing.	sadness	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	97	331	0.1702127659574468	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0638297872340425	0.0212765957446808	0.1276595744680851	0.1702127659574468	0.0638297872340425	0.1276595744680851	0.1063829787234042	0.05	2.9913963514813005	2.8312147839225585	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.

They went to a theme park to enjoy themselves and their parents were killed in front of them. It was a water ride, the kind that seats six at a time. Something mechanical happened on the ride. The maintenance check a few days prior was good, but something screwed up. There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.	anger/sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	144	2170	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0652173913043478	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.04	2.803115171970997	2.8067926541500885	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Do I think Kim by posting the pics made someone want to rob her? No, but I think it's probably best to be more modest about what you post. I mean, just for safeties sake. I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed. Yes, I'm sure everything is insured, but it's still a scary experience and I'd do everything I could to avoid it.	fear	2	4	3	33	60000	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857	104	748	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0833333333333333	2.283282633789956	2.1927734489412543	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	120	579	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

He is been owned by a guy and held in chains. He used Nosey to perform for public entertainment in circuses and forced for most of her life to give rides to adults and children  across the United States. Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being. The owner has been cited numerous times but in the same time his license was still approved for renewal each year. There should be awareness for this abuse to stop.	sadness	1	6	1	41	37500	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	125	203	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.873470592536993	2.777651032801173	low	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 37500$.

How could they just blatantly violate people in this way?  I suppose it is hopeful that we might learn from this, correct mistakes, but that doesn't mitigate the harm that was done!  It also doesn't bode well that protecting the victims now, after the fact, also seems to be in question.  The assumption that they were informed of the release of the data, I think, is reckless.  Verification that the already suffering victims won't be further victimized is as important as the far reaching implications of the data itself!

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution.

What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.

I read that  Syrians and Iraqis are granted asylum in Germany far more often than Pakistanis, and Nigerians. Germany is confronting the task of deciding who gets to stay. If you’re from Syria or Iraq, sanctuary is almost guaranteed. But if you’re from Nigeria or Pakistan, chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing. This is so distressing!	sadness	2	3	1	32	30000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	3.0	4.571000000000001	4.428999999999999	72	495	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.3125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.125	2.6363147748915265	2.432822435714678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 30000$.

This problem is all over in public buildings, parks and even in homes where lead pipes are still in existence.  This is a problem that can have both immediate and long-range problems for adults and children in the city.  Children growing up drinking this polluted water can have many health problems including learning disabilities, behavioral problems and a variety of diseases.   The homeless are also prone to having problems because they rely on public drinking fountains every day.	sadness	2	6	1	32	68000	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	95	421	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.3	0.2333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.9959229128700358	2.724745363624933	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 68000$.

Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

This person should be put in jail or at least fined because of what he has done.	sadness	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	64	1762	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1	2.852412999142699	2.9305723362601728	low	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them. Suddenly, one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	84	1653	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.3636363636363636	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8372062800669573	2.722851475211297	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

I'm sure it's pointless, but these two sides won't back down so it'll keep going on.  They're too nuclear powers so that's the only thing that makes this kind of interesting.

Some of them did not want to leave and now they can't get out at all. There are barely any medical services at all. Hardly anything to help with all the old age medical conditions that show up later in life. These people don't have enough food. They are scared they will die alone. I don't think many people have thought about this. I am so heartbroken for those people. I wish I could help them. Syria is such a mess. I pray somehow this can all come to a end soon. Too many deaths have occurred. These older people never thought they would have to live like this. Everything was normal until the war for them.

This is the PRIME example of where there should be a serious look at our gun laws. Sure there is that second amendment that allows for the right to bear arms but look at how much our society has changed. Should that not be taken into account when thinking about the possibility that maybe not everyone should actually have that right? It's really sad how much our society has devolved into this constant chaos of shootings, violence, and terror.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	112	433	0.2608695652173913	0.217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0869565217391304	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6758439692401628	2.830646025119476	low	low	An essay written by a 24 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000$.

When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today?

It's especially sad when these children are so young and taking their lives so early when they have the whole world ahead of them.	sadness	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	59	2309	0.08	0.04	0.16	0.04	0.12	0.2	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.12	0.0	3.25274091338769	3.0063497622528303	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

		297	3.5	1.375			It's amazing to me that you hear more about train crashes than you do about plane crashes. I just read about a train derailment in Spain that killed 50 people. The way it was described is that the train started swaying and just didn't stop until it was on its side. I can't imagine the dread that must have come over people as each sway became more pronounced.

I fully support expanding domestic oil operations so as to better establish energy independence, but care should be taken to respect the needs of others when developing pipelines. It may be expensive to ensure environmental care is taken and, when necessary, to reroute the pipelines to avoid encroaching on sacred lands, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the expense.	sadness	1	7	1	30	76000	5.5	1.5	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.857	3.571	3.571	2.857	81	149	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.3125	0.0625	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0526315789473684	2.9491168990980308	2.779684654342879	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000$.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again. Attorney Al Gerhardstein, who represents the DuBose family, said they want another trial and can’t understand why the jury couldn’t reach a conclusion. “With the video	neutral	1	6	3	30	30000	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	131	672	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.2777777777777778	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8319663967427458	2.859068827652776	low	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

For somebody who preach's morals its kind of hypocritical.  Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests. He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection.

These people are sheep.  Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.  Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side.

It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.

Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.	anger	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	111	1619	0.1162790697674418	0.1395348837209302	0.0465116279069767	0.0232558139534883	0.0465116279069767	0.0930232558139534	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.1162790697674418	0.0465116279069767	0.0	2.425378731837707	2.480071312673714	low	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Humans are always working they have no life. Work is not life. Some people don't get to spend time with there kids or family. They cant even have time for themselves. There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression. Not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients lead to sicknesses. Theres people who don't have enough time to see a doctor. Our lifestyle is the reason we're not getting enough sleep. People put way to much on there plate just so they can have money.

I assume that the people who go up to the Arctic to see it like polar bears and don't want to see them extinct.  And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

There are so many reasons why we should be using fewer resources as it is constantly destroying our environment and it is unfortunate that there are people who just continue to deplete our resources without a care in the world.

It is so bad that she died without anyone showing her true love.	neutral	1	7	1	28	165000	6.25	5.75	3.25	6.75	6.0	3.357	2.429	3.2145	3.4285	72	1931	0.0967741935483871	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0	2.8953135146976936	2.802490386282118	low	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000$.

The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with.

Many didn't agree with Hilary from the Bengazi investigation and many didn't agree with Trump, but in the end that's just politics.	neutral	2	6	1	25	75000	7.0	7.0	4.5	6.5	6.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	3.571	4.428999999999999	57	616	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.375	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.27766379596934	2.107743976588132	low	low	An essay written by a 25 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch.	anger/neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	125	2421	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.488522521692184	2.438170351606758	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I feel bad for this woman who felt a need to lie about her status of citizenship to stay in a country just to continue living a better life.  This is the second time she has been arrested which shows me that she is really trying to escape a war ravaged country and to continue on living a better life. They should let the girl go.

I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?

I don't think something like this should have happens and being an airport i definitely don't think this should have happened at all assuming all the security that they do have in place how was this to happen?	sadness	2	5	1	33	25000	7.0	4.5	4.0	7.0	7.0	4.714	1.286	3.857	5.0	96	200	0.2222222222222222	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.637032551213146	2.645565468343227	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 25000$.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	130	1978	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	124	1925	0.1428571428571428	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1142857142857142	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0588235294117647	2.539101061992444	2.3531190403933007	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	151	517	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

I am so angered over this and upset to think of the damage our garbage is causing.	anger	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	83	1611	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.2941176470588235	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.0	3.0953672340216034	3.129804082025386	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea.

This would imply that the woman does not know how to take care of herself and needs the guidance and monitoring of her husband. And what about women who do not want a husband?	surprise	1	2	1	30	30000	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	67	2424	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.805552976529156	2.891693306183156	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance. Something needs to be done to help.	sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	131	1728	0.16	0.04	0.08	0.08	0.04	0.24	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.9662714617149524	2.840008237173438	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Those people may have had children, mothers, sisters, friends, co-workers, and now they are dead, and for what?  How did this individual go so long without being apprehended.

Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.  Even though they're dead bodies it seems lonely that they'd be there without getting taken back to civilization.	sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	103	1812	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1538461538461538	2.4462914634871504	2.375091147128485	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I just thought the science of it all was interesting, or the analysis . But it shows what humans do to all environments they come in contact with.  They change them.  The migrate and bring in new things.  And that affects stuff.  That's not always our fault, but that's the way of things.  And yet we think it's fine to let refugees and immigrants go where they want, as if there aren't repercussions for that. There are repercussions for everything.  Migration changes habitats.

I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

And obviously the authorities, who do nothing and allow this to go on.  But what about the families who keep having children they feel obligated to send to work at age 11 and 12?  Stop having children you can't feed.  These countries are all grossly overpopulated but they keep having kids.  The parents feel bad that their kids got treated this way, but they're the ones who sent them there.	anger/disgust	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	96	2070	0.125	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.25	0.0	0.0	2.8744874796667133	2.7680385344052407	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	146	528	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.  Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	121	1919	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.546873917097362	2.515941125349095	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	119	1983	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.

Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.

I guess his parents divorced at a young age but both gave him the genes to act.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	68	483	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	3.0563380459686957	2.6844071673218037	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country. The number of women in power is small, and women feel conflicted between what society says they should do and what they want to do. After all, many have aspirations besides raising kids. Who says that the 'house-mom' idea is right? The gender gap needs to close, and the wage gap. Women are not paid as much as men. That's a fact.	sadness	1	6	1	26	63000	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.714	1.286	4.428999999999999	4.714	110	204	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3636363636363636	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.6658610189203977	2.5871325905154263	medium	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000$.

However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	108	353	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

I just don't care.  Syria is an absolute mess and millions of people are suffering and I feel like I don't care because it's not my problem.

I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point. As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase. Those in opposition, who feel that it's just an umbrella word to funnel monies in areas that are not needed. That believe Mother Nature and the natural state of how our Earth and it's environment works, are also somewhat correct.

		201	1.0	3.875			This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.	anger	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	127	2282	0.1714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2	0.0285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0	0.0	2.6552150555355345	2.7455473779221067	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

It makes no sense, it's hard to believe the guy did it on purpose, but it's hard to believe he didn't remember him twice.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	140	216	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

In most cases you cant always be sure if the women is telling the truth or just getting back at a guy but multiple women coming forward you just have to believe this guy is a danger to society. He should be locked up for a very long time in my eyes.	anger/disgust	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	137	2066	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0454545454545454	2.714901653025	2.833032835416724	low	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Though it seems like they will be able to withstand the changes in temperature, it is not at all clear what will be the outcome of the potentially lost habitats they live in due to climate change. These guys have been around longer than we have, as a species. It's really sad to think that we would be responsible for endangering them even further than we already have.	sadness	1	4	1	39	48000	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999	93	342	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.9268940951230484	2.9342723281824377	low	low	An essay written by a 39 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000$.

The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.

This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	disgust	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	136	2110	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

There was an incredible amount of focus on the two American soldiers who happened to be blown to smithereens and not the Afghani civilians, but what can you do? I suppose American people are much more interested in their boys fighting an endless war and not the innocent people caught in the crossfire.	neutral	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	63	1890	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.778420445337598	2.6520121109259507	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

Investigators said the window of the child's bedroom was open and he was able to push open the screen. Officers and paramedics rushed to the Willoughby Hills Towers apartment complex on Chardon Road after a security guard reported a small child fell out of the window and onto the parking deck below.

It affects genes and ranges in species. More than eighty percent of ecosystems are being put under stress.

I was told by the System to enter the code after the survey so I completed the survey and answered with all neutral answers. The instructions said that I would get paid if I somehow was not connected with anyone (i.e. if they disconnected). I guess in this situation they did in fact disconnect. I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so. War tears cities apart, and it is hard for me to understand how so many innocent people suffer due to the whims of those in power. I hope to get paid for my efforts.

I'm very happy to live in this beautiful country and I wish people would stop complaining so much about everything they think is wrong here.  Just be grateful you're not being used as a human shield.  Some of the things going on over there are just atrocious, and as bad as people think it is here it doesn't even hold a candle to that.  I am saddened to hear about these families and children being harmed so maliciously.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	93	1801	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0588235294117647	2.842991189146281	2.7532463948031936	low	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

The thought of receiving a warning like that while you are sitting with your family is just mind boggling to me. What would you do? Where would you go? It's hard to believe people have been living with such violence for such an extended period of time.	neutral	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	79	1986	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	3.0501442111884445	2.9984064563180857	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?

It mentioned several times that multiple people were brutally raped and even murdered, sometimes by government officials, and this is really distressing and sad.  That is obviously something that should never happen to anyone, so it makes me sad to hear that these people suffered like that.  I think clearly something needs to be done over there but I'm not sure what.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	88	2303	0.25	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.758962548176666	2.7592402911433704	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

She went through such deep sadness in her short life. I was so hoping and fighting to give her a second chance at life. A part of me feels a deep relief – the last two days were very difficult and she had so much to cope with.

		417	4.0	3.25			I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

Apparently, the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below. Everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible tragedy it was. I feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again. You're suppose to have fun at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting hurt when you get on these rides. Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.	sadness	2	6	1	28	63000	6.5	4.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.143	1.0	2.571	4.714	124	312	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0434782608695652	3.076003552971601	2.9289884995829376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000$.

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected.

I understand if you don't have air conditioning it might need to be wide, but why can't we have limits so that a small body can't fall out? It's a terrible thing, and one I'm sure the parents never even considered. Alternative to that I suppose you'd have to not have anything at all a child could climb up to the window on. It's just too sad though, because you would need to not even have a stool - at two, a kid could certainly move one of those.	sadness	2	7	5	44	70000	4.5	7.0	1.5	7.0	1.5	3.714	2.429	4.857	4.571	105	1836	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.5047024179936286	2.5378734331378308	low	low	An essay written by a 44 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison.

If so, his reign of terror is over. How sad that those people died for what appears to be just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person.

It's too bad the wolf traveled so far looking for a mate just to be killed, but I guess these things happen sometimes.  Perhaps the sniper should have been a little more careful.  A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason.

I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.

The economic crisis that is happening there is not only affecting people, but also the animals that live there. Especially in the zoos. We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos. Many animals have suffered for weeks.	sadness	1	4	1	25	50000	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	141	499	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.974944276653888	2.956256016531595	medium	low	An essay written by a 25 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

The elevator company has to be at fault here, but that won't bring her back! I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim.

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status.

The leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to guilt you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while majority of this money goes towards these non-profit organizations that help them push thier agenda. These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal. By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.	neutral	1	4	5	27	45000	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	108	734	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.861190685362936	2.84778427910004	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000$.

When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it.

These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.  These Arabs and Persians are just so passive and impotent with their overlords.	anger/disgust	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	133	2054	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0	2.5408346036547678	2.471799664988035	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1	6	3	30	40000	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	87	643	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

		128	2.0	3.875			This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.

Haiti has been brutalized by mother nature, and the Clintons, and people are trying to get somehwere to survive while the country recovers. The U.S. let's them in to ship them back out and that is a bit ridiculous. It's not a situation where those from Mexico just sneak over and hide from society. These people need help but it doesn't shock me that the U.S. wiould do this in a time of need.

The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1	6	3	30	35000	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	113	639	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	3.009758951199248	2.78106625686191	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000$.

I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

I think smoking should only be banned if it harms other people.	neutral	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	70	1979	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.125	2.6355314553854114	2.6151847085797937	medium	low	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time.

Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.  Really, what is wrong with people?	disgust/surprise	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	83	2436	0.1621621621621621	0.1891891891891892	0.0	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.054054054054054	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.0	2.889257168148965	2.726688923696076	medium	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

I am scared of planes for that very reason. There is nothing you can do about it. She was the very first of four woment to fly the J-10 fighter jet. The J-10 is a single engine fighter jet. She was very proud of herself for being the first woman to fly in the fighter jet.	neutral	1	6	3	33	63000	7.0	7.0	5.75	6.0	7.0	4.1425	1.0	2.0715	4.2145	84	1946	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0666666666666666	2.7762095270102582	2.4695115412542736	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 63000$.

Since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal, they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation. Emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel. Feelings are not permanent, but an ongoing thing because people constantly try to bring up, suppress, or manage feelings	neutral	1	6	3	30	40000	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	73	524	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.3	0.0	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.9917231199046785	2.922755860176507	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

It's really sad that they place economic growth over human lives. If they did implement safety standards, they wouldn't lose so many lives or potential workers and people that care for children.	sadness	2	6	1	45	19000	4.0	4.5	5.0	6.0	5.5	2.4290000000000003	2.4290000000000003	3.143	3.571	54	192	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	3.022993440228324	2.8197570637089755	medium	medium	An essay written by a 45 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 19000$.

		292	2.5	1.0			Just read an article about a shooting that happened in California. The details were sparse, but apparently a man opened fire with an assault rifle in the public space and only killed one elderly man. Say what you will, but this seems like close to an ideal resolution to a scenario like this. The article then doubled back and said the suspect was still alive despite pronouncing him dead earlier in the text.
