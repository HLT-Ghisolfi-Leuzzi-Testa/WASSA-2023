Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

Infants, middle schoolers, high schoolers… It is not easy for kids to be kids, to depend on parents who are also struggle with their problems and issues. The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.	neutral	2	7	1	45	120000	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0

In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop. I do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to save themselves, and this is the biggest tragedy of all.	fear	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857

Initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and attention this situation is creating. I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

Their time should be spent on non-criminals.  But if they believe the police are the ones who handed them over to a drug cartel, then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them.	neutral	2	6	1	33	75000	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.

I also was surprised that they did not try to take the story and flip it into being some type of political debate about how the shooter was made about politics or a race war.	surprise	1	4	2	27	35000	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	Anger	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	207.0	44.0	2.0	train	706.0

And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas.

It is so cruel for other students to bully each other and be cruel to each other.  It is so very unnecessary and why treat people that way?  Why not do unto others as you would have the do unto you?  It seems that more and more this happens and people are not teaching their children how to treat other people.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness.

The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution.

As a gun supporter maybe I should take a step back and ask myself the hard questions about guns and there impact and availability in today's society. I know that statistically more people die from other causes compared to gun violence, but are guns way to accessible in America compared to other countries? When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today? Seeing so many mass shootings makes me feel that maybe it's time to change some of the gun laws and help make things like 40 children killed or injured a thing of the past.	sadness	1	4	1	30	30000	6.5	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.0	5.0	2.571	4.714	5.0

I guess this is because a lot more money is spent by woman in the fashion and personal products industry. The article says more men are grooming themselves and it's starting to bring wages for male models slowly up.

Maybe doing things collaboratively can help change things for the better.	anger	2	5	3	44	38000	7.0	5.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	3.857	3.0	5.0	3.714

There is a huge number of deaths due to hazing in Indonesia. All driven by over-industrialisation and hunger of profits. Governments and scientists should do more to prevent these kinds of deaths: at least to have certain warning systems installed. Also, natural disasters such as hails and typhoons can wreck a havoc in peoples’ lives. Now I have second thoughts about traveling to South Pasific islands.

We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people.

People should also drive safer as well. There is definitely too much speeding. I wonder if drunk driving was the cause of the wreck. That's a huge problem that causes a bunch of wrecks. Don't drink and drive people.	anger	1	2	1	45	31000	6.5	1.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	1.571

This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

		128	2.0	3.875			This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.	Anger	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	231.0	48.0	2.0	train	730.0

First of all, the zoo was horrid. Less than 20 animals remained of the hundreds that had been previously housed here. The rescue of the animals occurred under rather harrowing conditions with Hamas and Israeli forces launching missles during the evacuation process. It sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species. They will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the wild.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.
