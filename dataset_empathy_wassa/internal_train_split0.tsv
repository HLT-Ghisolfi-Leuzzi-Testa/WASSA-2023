I think so much more needs to be done to defeat ISIS they are like the black plague spreading in the middle east. They hate america and destroy innocent lives I just dont know how you could kill so many people and not feel bad. They are killing people and show casing them in the streets it is hard to understand how in this day and age groups can do that it reminds me of the nazis during the holocaust I fear if this is not taen care of soon it will spread to other areas liek the us with more terroristic events happening.	fear/sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	120	2085	0.225	0.15	0.0	0.05	0.0	0.025	0.275	0.175	0.1	0.0	0.0	3.067301986416784	2.9690699244306376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Many Doctors Don’t See Past the Fat — You must lose weight, a doctor told Sarah Bramblette, advising a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet. But Ms. Bramblette had a basic question: How much do I weigh? The doctor’s scale went up to 350 pounds, and she was heavier than that. If she did not know the number, how would she know if the diet was working?""  A populace that is so uneducated on health and nutrition that they don't know that it's mathematically impossible not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet. What's worse is a doctor who is so incompetent that he can't tell her that.

She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again.

I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.	hope/neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	128	2157	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.681165264634731	2.6242989345013825	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Vaccines were offered to the government because there was little they could do for those folks other than IVs.   The government refused to take help from the World Health Organization.   The corruption that goes on that country never ceases to amaze me.   I got extremely frustrated reading what could have been done but nothing was done.   So many people died that should not have.  	anger/neutral	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	96	2150	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.3181818181818182	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	2.5526287464045216	2.4245958118565976	medium	low	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.

Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2	6	1	23	65000	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	124	1208	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0256410256410256	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.0416666666666666	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	low	medium	An essay written by a 23 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

I don't particularly know whether she is guilty or not, but for it to be played out in the media isn't fair. While they may not have the same protections that the accused have in the United States, they should still give her a new trial, something quiet, out of the public eye, maybe even outside of the country, where she can get a fair trial based on the facts. If there is video of her spiking the coffee, or any indication that she has had any contact with cyanide, then I say she should get a retrial.	anger	1	4	1	50	96000	6.0	2.5	1.5	4.0	7.0	1.429	1.143	3.429	1.286	108	998	0.125	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.667586750609648	2.63781030308241	low	low	An essay written by a 50 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 96000$.

The move was a welcome development and everything should be done to make sure things like this does not happen.	neutral	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	80	1884	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.702570750711038	2.9812675905528843	low	medium	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

I feel pretty sympathetic towards the family, they lost a great man. I am glad he made so much music cause his stuff will live on forever.

It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1	7	1	47	54000	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	106	1075	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000$.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results.

Especially since these people gave over their passwords willingly, it's hard to understand the legal precedent for sending someone to jail over this.	surprise	1	4	1	20	350000	6.5	5.0	4.0	3.5	3.0	3.857	2.4290000000000003	4.0	3.286	63	1399	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.6674178097747547	2.7370866100166245	low	low	An essay written by a 20 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 350000$.

It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	128	1157	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

It's very concerning to me that I hear a member of the government seemingly unconcerned about how these people are being treated.

The instructions said that I would get paid if I somehow was not connected with anyone (i.e. if they disconnected). I guess in this situation they did in fact disconnect. I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so.

Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

It seems too like a problem with such a huge scope that there is not much people can do.  It is sad that they are suffering, I don't think any animals should have to suffer at the hands of humans especially just for the need to make money which is all this was avbout.

		417	4.0	3.25			I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I can understand that protests can become unsafe or even violent so you need tactics to over come that but with such numbers of people getting very hurt and permanently disabled I think thye should change there tactics.

Overall, it's terrible that this is still going on in the world today and there's nothing we can do about it.	sadness	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	78	1684	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.238095238095238	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	3.075209032338521	2.8558480455540454	medium	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	120	1133	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

So many people need to seek help for sleep disorders, because where the disorder itself may not cause major health issues, it can lead to major health issues.	fear	2	6	1	33	75000	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	83	804	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.2857142857142857	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	0.0	3.173147678357577	2.9256379406579613	medium	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

I imagine it's the same people who believe the earth is flat. We should be working towards clean and renewable energy but of course there are fights all across the way because people want to make money. Also replacing infrastructure is hard. But, that's not an excuse when you know that entire parts of the country might expand into a desert. This is especially true of North America.	surprise	1	6	1	26	63000	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.714	1.286	4.428999999999999	4.714	84	1343	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0	2.657124720376749	2.694372943599112	low	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days.

They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	134	1068	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	135	943	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	107	832	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there.

It's crazy to blame something like this on pharmaceutical companies or anyone other than the drug users themselves, and there is really no excuse for a baby to ever get their hands on someone's medication.  Keep it in a cabinet very high up out of reach where the baby can not get to it, no exceptions!  This is ridiculous and the majority of the time the person doesn't even need to be taking the drug in the first place.  They are just abusing it due to their own addiction or weakness.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	anger/neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	134	2151	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.1707317073170731	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

		201	1.0	3.875			This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.

I'm not sure that there is an obvious solution except maybe better sanitation for some of these people.  But I guess some of that is cultural and not much can be done to fix it.  Educating the people about it does not seem to have helped much, nor does vaccinating them.

The man could have handled it better, but he was within his rights to shoot the dog for his protection. The owner should have kept her dog on a better leash and not let the dog run freely in the park. Hopefully the owner will learn from this.	neutral	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	66	1939	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.794399491517173	2.7191101850502752	low	low	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings. I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried. I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	anger	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	116	923	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.3043478260869565	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.873318764423922	2.927632080674066	low	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

I know you care a lot about the environment so I thought you should see this. There are some countries that are for the poaching of elephants if you can believe it. Some more rural communities say that the animals harm their crops. I've never heard this side of the argument before! I'm not saying I agree with it, but we're over here in America and have a way different perspective on the issues.

This is just crazy to me and I hope that it never actually happens and that the people who live there can fight it. It just seems to me that this is just another case of government over reach.

I know we always or mostly mean well but this story amply displayed how when we interfere with natural order of things even with the best of intentions, we can make the matters worse. People were inadvertently spreading the virus beyond the natural reach of infected frog population which in turn was destroying other harmless and healthy frog groups.

They recently charged an officer who shot an unarmed black driver when he was outside his vehicle.It's like the police don't even care anymore which is really scary.	fear	1	5	1	28	39000	3.5	5.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.143	2.857	3.286	2.857	55	841	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8280165070453203	2.782753023599648	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 39000$.

You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch.	anger/neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	125	2421	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.488522521692184	2.438170351606758	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all. In fact, Germany is in rapid negotiations with Afghanistan and other countries to repatriate those who have fled.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	113	869	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?  People are stupid, even Jews, some of the smartest people in the world.	anger	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	124	1607	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.0	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.2068965517241379	0.3103448275862069	0.0689655172413793	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.0	2.2894066003275304	2.33898907419783	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

That's not to say we should necessarily do that, or that we necessarily get anything truly valuable out of doing that, but it's the reality.  And so I felt sad reading this, thinking about the loss this father felt, and all the terrible emotions he would have experienced from the beginning of the even to, well, his death, probably.  And the terror of the people at the concert.  And the anger of the people afterwards who committed harassment and whatnot against Muslims.  All of the emotions I felt and was chagrined by.  These are barbaric people and events.	anger/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	117	2165	0.1612903225806451	0.1612903225806451	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.0	2.8345760494213126	2.772318812528194	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I, too, have suffered from dark depression for the last 10 years.  I think daily it would be awesome to die.  Medications do not work for me.   I was born this way and people who know nothing about the intricacies of this terrible disease do not understand.  It's our wiring and absolutely nothing helps when you have had it your entire life.

Police brutality is such a problem in our country and it's just so deeply ingrained in the system, I'm not sure what can be done.

That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

		182	6.0	6.0			This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward.

I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes.

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.

After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

He ended up having to have surgery to remove the chopstick out of hiis penis.

But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.	anger/disgust	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	134	2398	0.2058823529411764	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.0294117647058823	0.4117647058823529	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0	2.553277780366228	2.4901476129719278	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

It seems wrong that people use religion as an excuse for violence.	sadness	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	76	1765	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.2903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.0555555555555555	2.715718343667114	2.7363010531004552	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.

Do species have the ability to adapt and thrive in new clients or will they disappear. What will happen to humans as well?

It sucks that it happened but in all fairness Mexico is a shit hole and well known for cartel actions such as this.  How many of your peers have to get abducted and killed or tortured before you learn to shut the fuck up or get the fuck out?

The first article talks about how people argue that smoking should be banned in public places so that children would not imitate them. I personally don't have an opinion on this matter; I don't have children and I'm not a smoke either. The second article disturbed me a great deal. It talks about the work of a food inspector and it surprised me how dirty some stores can be. It really makes me wonder if I should continue going to that place near my house that does not have a perfect score.	surprise	1	4	5	19	1000000	6.0	5.5	3.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	3.429	4.0	4.143	105	1336	0.0	0.0625	0.15625	0.15625	0.09375	0.25	0.09375	0.03125	0.03125	0.125	0.05	2.5994188877717352	2.5386094874472995	low	low	An essay written by a 19 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 1000000$.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit.

To think that they would push their employees to the brink of suicide and having mental health issues is totally ridiculous.  And all in the name of the almighty dollar.  I wish companies cared more for their employees, than their bottom line.  I have worked for a company for over 30 years and in the early years, the company cared about its employees.  They treated us like family.  The last ten or fifteen years have been so difficult.  They could care less about their loyal employees.  They treat us like dirt.

Generations of fisherman can't fish there. Fish isn't safe to eat. It's beyond sad.	sadness	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	79	1863	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0555555555555555	2.646001987065594	2.519429545683172	medium	low	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	119	1983	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The fact that they can cause so much damage to an environment and have no natural predators is crazy. It makes you second guess flushing the fish down the toilet as it may survive. It's hard to believe that they get so big since they are usually just little fish in a small tank. Also it's weird that they travel so far considering we usually just see them swimming in circles.	surprise	1	6	1	32	85000	6.0	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	3.286	2.0	3.857	4.0	81	1357	0.0526315789473684	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.3157894736842105	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.0	2.6919148831428887	2.527933442427301	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000$.

It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	108	1871	0.18	0.18	0.02	0.02	0.06	0.08	0.22	0.14	0.08	0.02	0.0454545454545454	2.667612087015073	2.756443482830526	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	136	1040	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.

The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need.	hope/sadness	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	77	1586	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.1470588235294117	0.1176470588235294	0.088235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.088235294117647	0.088235294117647	0.0	0.2058823529411764	0.1428571428571428	3.312795615473694	3.1052871674743683	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

Just read an article about bananas, the kind you buy in a supermarket, which are apparently called Cavendish bananas and are expressly considered ""commercial"". Apparently, commercial bananas are under threat due to their lack of genetic diversity, making them prone to fungal diseases -- another variation, ""Big Mike"", went the way of the buffalo in the 60s for the same reason. I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning. It might be possible in someplace like the U.S., where we have money for R & D, but I worry about how this would affect people in poorer countries."	surprise	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	137	1369	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.1851851851851851	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.5686874432891256	2.4842293781036027	low	low	An essay written by a 52 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

		297	3.0	1.75			It must be terrifying to be in a trail derailment like that.  Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.  Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	121	1919	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.546873917097362	2.515941125349095	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	138	2357	0.1702127659574468	0.1063829787234042	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.0212765957446808	0.1276595744680851	0.2553191489361702	0.1063829787234042	0.0638297872340425	0.0212765957446808	0.0476190476190476	2.5914474085383152	2.4718460691420208	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

There should be more talks of mental health and treatment for people instead of banning guns. There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns.

Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.  I would say these people are lucky.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	100	1667	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.1379310344827586	0.1724137931034483	0.0689655172413793	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.0	0.1724137931034483	0.1	2.979917730018315	2.7991357988102017	medium	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

I worry enough about this kind of stuff as it is, and now I just have more to worry about when I leave the house. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss. It makes me want to just stay inside.	fear	2	6	1	29	50000	5.5	4.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	2.0	3.0	2.286	3.0	73	773	0.1071428571428571	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0357142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	2.720136794375946	2.681127828334825	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

It seems very few people are trying to stop it and it is maddening. We need to take more control over the things that are being put into the air that could be causing such an atrocious thing. We need to start reusing things and switching to organically grown things, if possible. The oceans and lakes are suffering and eventually, we will, too.	disgust	2	2	1	29	45000	5.5	5.0	4.0	6.5	3.5	3.429	5.0	2.571	4.428999999999999	76	1226	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.938107310092154	2.942186289995784	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 45000$.

We were talking about this the other day.  Well apparently it will not be ending any time soon.  It is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it.  There are organizations out there that is trying to prevent this and fight against childhood obesity.  The WHO organization is blaming video bloggers/vloggers who get paychecks from junk food companies.  They are claiming that they are more powerful than ads.

They stole her innocense and trust in people. They deserve life in jail the fact that they are out is just absurd. If they could do this to there own child i think they are to be considered at risk to other children and the community. It shows they have no moral compass and consious. I feel for that girl how you could ever live a normal life or create real relationships after being used for sex for so long is beyond me.

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.

I was a little sad by the comments made by the one band member stating that he believed that Muslim security helped the shooters.That kind of thinking is hurtful. The people who did the shooting are monsters, but that does not include all Muslims. 	neutral	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	72	2032	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0526315789473684	2.592589984765149	2.484603305283048	low	low	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

I assume that the people who go up to the Arctic to see it like polar bears and don't want to see them extinct.  And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway.	sadness	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	84	1653	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.3636363636363636	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8372062800669573	2.722851475211297	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	disgust/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	128	2042	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.1724137931034483	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0909090909090909	2.611000319206454	2.4650590113548265	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

		291	7.0	2.5			Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day.

He hasn't done anything that would make him anti gay.	anger	2	5	1	37	60000	4.0	2.5	1.5	4.0	4.0	2.286	3.429	3.0	3.143	90	1009	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.501444729632733	2.41424995987853	low	low	An essay written by a 37 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000$.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	150	1452	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	768	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	116	1451	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	131	2017	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0434782608695652	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

If they are really concerned, condoms work well.	fear	2	5	1	30	55000	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	75	827	0.1875	0.0	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.6344320442312887	2.6159840275985844	low	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000$.

If their lives aren't taken, they probably lost their homes or belongings somehow. This makes it hard for many people to pick themselves back up and continue living. I think that they should definitely try and get some sort of help from the government.	sadness	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	71	2349	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	3.024802312090148	2.8233167927787943	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

A girl ran into a police officer with her car, while taking a nude topless selfie to send to her boyfriend. Feel a little bad for her, even though she should not be doing this, especially with a glass of wine in her cup holder haha. Guessing she was drunk, which is the main crime here. She had a bond of 2000 dollars I believe. I kind of want her to be freed haha.	joy	1	6	6	23	55000	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.0	1.857	3.571	3.429	88	1482	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.2941176470588235	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.697369532579177	2.6690779831844447	low	low	An essay written by a 23 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	anger/neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	134	2152	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

At the same time, they are extremely important and truly open our vision to the world. It would be devastating for a young person to suffer an eye injury simply playing a sport.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	neutral	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	130	1978	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories.

Plastic in the ocean gets coated with algae which emits a sulfur smell that some seabirds love. Pretty crazy, right? Anyway, it's sad what we're doing to our environment. It's sadder that we are pretty powerless to do anything about it. It's only a matter of time before everything justs collapses on itself.

I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2	6	1	45	30000	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	98	1425	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	disgust	2	6	1	26	47000	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	76	1261	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.883259260990456	2.922690528251083	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 47000$.

It's not relevant to me or the people that I know and care about. It's not something that I would just choose to read either. Ok. Have you seen this article about the dad that killed his daughter's molester? Apparently she was molested when she was young, the guy went to jail for a year and a half and was let out. Many years later, the dad went and shot the guy. That's pretty much it. I don't know why I'm sending this to you, but what do you think? I think that it was boring and I wasn't interested in it at all.	anger	5	6	1	32	8000	6.5	7.0	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.2860000000000005	1.143	3.286	1.286	153	900	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.088235294117647	0.2058823529411764	0.1176470588235294	0.088235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.0434782608695652	2.303109501420792	2.2215038852829254	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 8000$.

It was gruesome to hear one man's account of the story.  He said the shootings went on for 3 hours, and when stopped, it was only so they could load more ammunition and fire more.  I couldn't help but think about the people out in the crowd who where hit and killed.  It's disturbing just imagining that scene and the terror.  And then one man, George Salines, got a call no one would want.  That his daughter was among the 130 killed.  The loss has affected his whole life, he left his job and everything.  In one moment, anyone can be affected by severe tragedy.	fear	5	7	3	34	100000	5.5	4.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	1.857	2.857	4.143	127	770	0.1923076923076923	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.2692307692307692	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.745120334409751	2.817340033594152	low	medium	An essay written by a 34 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.	fear/sadness	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	118	2078	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	2.8106067462790105	2.6044920664133167	medium	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.  I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	124	1925	0.1428571428571428	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1142857142857142	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0588235294117647	2.539101061992444	2.3531190403933007	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

		292	1.0	1.25			This story basically didn't bother me at all, except for the fact that the media seemed to unnecessarily conflate the shooting with the election, even when they later admit that the shooting had nothing to do with the election. There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.  I have no idea what this shooting was and honestly do not care.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	131	1966	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0	0.0	2.3974494665295736	2.3465556227951136	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect.

It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.

		417	1.1666666666666667	1.0			After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.	neutral	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	115	2005	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.2571428571428571	0.1142857142857142	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.753786559096828	2.800814964553498	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Since she is stronger, she will survive, then they can bring her back to complete health, then do it again for the next 3 years, then keep repeating it until she dies. I can't comprehend why people like this do these things, but there is a special place in hell. I don't buy the mental illness garbage. OF COURSE she has a mental illness, but that shouldn't automatically imply protection from justice.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

There are more important things in life than money and oil.	disgust	2	6	1	31	32000	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	60	1199	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.2631578947368421	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.1578947368421052	0.0769230769230769	3.0261279038995057	2.739867333382548	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000$.

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.	neutral/sadness	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	133	2147	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.674559314803139	2.6434111615432863	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

While the poachers are a definite problem, I think we need to also be worried about those that are buying the ivory. If we remove the demand, perhaps that will go a long way to helping stop the killing. I think cracking down on both sides of this issue is the only way we will see real change.	anger	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	85	2290	0.1851851851851851	0.1851851851851851	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.0	0.037037037037037	0.2962962962962963	0.1851851851851851	0.037037037037037	0.0	0.0	2.712764426842268	2.814826411589144	low	low	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

The fact that people are using elephants for entertainment and just taking them away from their families is really disturbing.	sadness	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	66	1698	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	3.2302218738129302	3.2200996579311547	medium	high	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

It just seems like it's gotten unsafe to go anywhere public these days with large crowds.  The situation is obviously out of hand in France and it is bad in the United States too.  Everywhere really.  I don't trust the terrorists or Muslims and there are many other problematic groups as well.

To me it doesn't really matter as I never even thought about someone being a Jew until I got older. People are people. Jews are smart. Jews have always been smart at least for generations. Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate. OTOH people have a legitimate concern to fear that Trump being elected will cause problems like WW2 did. After all Jews tend to be Republican and likely donated a ton of money to Trump and they are more powerful today than they ever were.

All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

I think it is really just crazy.	surprise	2	6	1	39	45000	6.0	5.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	4.2860000000000005	1.714	4.143	4.571000000000001	72	1307	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.923762109023012	2.895102296458356	medium	medium	An essay written by a 39 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000$.

I assume this was done by a psychopath who likes sadistic things.  Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.

Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	122	1898	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.1935483870967742	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.0555555555555555	2.305731052841248	2.071920123071438	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned.

The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas.

The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.

I'm thinking that the family wants to bring the bodies back to the States and that could be holding up the autopsies.	surprise	2	6	1	58	60000	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	1.714	2.4290000000000003	105	1395	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.786801374507373	2.64032793888475	low	low	An essay written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000$.

There are a lot of vile people out there, just gotta encourage them a little bit and they'll come out. Trump was their encouragement. What will the liberals do now? I don't know. Sometimes I think we will be okay, sometimes I think we won't. I just know that going to one march is going to do shit. You need tens of marches, packed to the brim. You need them every weekend.

And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas.

And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	anger	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	126	1629	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.2258064516129032	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.0666666666666666	2.7327701042089507	2.750775429656553	low	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I had a job in career that compared identically to a man's and he was paid 40% more than me.   You can't express it or you get fire because almost every state is an at-will state.	anger/disgust/sadness	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	83	2190	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.3636363636363636	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.560820604701326	2.433680457993008	medium	medium	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.

Are we putting their interests at heart, or just our political ones?	sadness	2	6	1	31	34999	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	85	1813	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.1428571428571428	2.764844651860832	2.6197079766845524	low	low	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 34999$.

I feel like they are twist to the religion that is out to give them a bad name., Kidnapping children is just too low even for the hardest of criminals.

That is something just scary overall to be quite honest.	fear/sadness	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	61	2076	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.2222222222222222	3.082035389208547	2.993734740982939	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.
