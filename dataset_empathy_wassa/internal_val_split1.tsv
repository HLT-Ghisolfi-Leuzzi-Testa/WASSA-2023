I'm not sure I needed to hear about all the specifics as to why seabirds are eating plastic, but it definitely hurts to see that it's going on.

The idea that a foster care system allows for brothers to be split apart that came in together in insane.  It's strange to me that we treat human life as if it is less than important.   I wish that people would wake up from the old-world ideals and behavior.  Thanks to the 20th century and the advent of film as a story-telling mechanic, we have the ability to be able to share stories with each other on a bigger level.  I can't believe that it's 2018 and we still operate as if it's 1400 a.d.   I am disgusted by our modern culture and our governmental system.  It's all a sham.

This man, a wealthy Hong Kong banker, murdered two young women in his apartment in a gruesome and sadistic fashion. He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment. He slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase.	disgust	1	2	5	29	26000	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286

It's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a hot spring that fell into one that was way too hot, and was basically boiled alive. It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.	disgust	1	2	2	20	80000	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

Without involvement with humans, animals do not deserve rights. It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.

She went through such deep sadness in her short life. I was so hoping and fighting to give her a second chance at life. A part of me feels a deep relief – the last two days were very difficult and she had so much to cope with.
