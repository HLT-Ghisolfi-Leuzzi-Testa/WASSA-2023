		125	2.833333333333333	1.25			I guess I just feel bad for these people.  Losing your home to a fire has got to suck.  Not only did you lose everything you love and own in the blink of an eye, but let's be honest, it was probably your fault.  Usually fires start because you were doing something you weren't supposed to, or there was shoddy work completed.	neutral	1	5	1	31	82000	3.5	2.5	2.0	4.5	5.0	3.571	2.286	1.857	2.0	62	2387	0.1379310344827586	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.1379310344827586	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.0	2.825407819109776	2.5856017921603325	low	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 82000$.

They also probably lived a life many of us can only dream about. This might sound wrong, but I will probably forget about this in 5 minutes. Life goes on. I've already spent more time thinking about them than they will ever think about me.	sadness	1	6	1	39	30000	6.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	4.0	2.143	3.571	3.857	68	53	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0769230769230769	2.507963926060702	2.351380279339801	low	low	An essay written by a 39 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

I feel so very sad and alarmed for them, as I know the citizens are helpless and don't know who to turn to for help. It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2	2	1	40	85000	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	152	273	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000$.

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention. I feel for the little froggies though and hope science can find a way to preserve them and their habitat.	sadness	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	118	406	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0416666666666666	3.0733373234461627	2.8491270178866577	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	anger/neutral	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	134	2151	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.1707317073170731	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

Climate change can affect the habitats of wild animals and cause them to die from things like lack of water, which is still a big deal.

I used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the mouth over Obama being elected, and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending RIGHT NOW because a black man was in the white house. Now...I don't know. I see my friends and family freaking out and I want to tell them to just chill out. Obama didn't destroy America--the right wingers were wrong about that. Neither will Trump. Life will keep going. It brings a lot of stress listening to people freaking out all the time. And yet, I get it. I get why they are worried and freaking out. I don't like it either, but I don't get the point of stressing out so much. But then again, I've completely dissociated from all this.

There food is gone there water is unsafe but it is nice to know that aid workers eventhough it is a tough site to see are remaining to truly help out.	sadness	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	135	2311	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0333333333333333	3.122877600428177	2.8978989645831947	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.	sadness	1	2	1	23	27000	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	77	63	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.811145798313764	2.7370854918760794	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000$.

At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it. I think what Germany needs is to overhaul their immigration laws and make a change down the middle where asylum is fair but realistic.	neutral	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	65	1956	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.746839353067087	2.588865446699511	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1	4	3	30	60000	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	124	711	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

The problem is, there is nowhere to go.  There are a few camps for refugees but not nearly enough space.  People are even taking there sheep which can’t be helpful…  The IS has had people under their rule for almost 3 years and the people are making a run from it.  No doubt they have every reason – the young women and girls feel veil-less freedom!  The IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  The were right to leave as the city is now a war zone with Iraqi security forces retaking the city.  It is a bitter fight with the usual “blood will spill” messages rampant. Many families are leaving and there are some really heart-wrenching tales. SO SAD… Many are in fear.	sadness	1	7	1	57	142000	5.5	6.0	5.5	7.0	6.5	3.714	1.714	3.857	4.571000000000001	145	88	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.024390243902439	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.1219512195121951	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.048780487804878	0.0	2.6184281655549944	2.508491859457604	low	medium	An essay written by a 57 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 142000$.

I think less violent and severe tactics should have been taken in this case. It is there discretion but I think he was just taking his anger out on this lady and in no way should that be allowed. In front of her children and family. Maybe she was just worried the arrest was not suppose to happen, you should not be able to become violent out of anger.	disgust	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	98	2130	0.1428571428571428	0.1020408163265306	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0816326530612244	0.2244897959183673	0.0816326530612244	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.125	2.755922505876379	2.928137618868038	low	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

They were parked outside of a Dollar General when thankfully someone noticed and called 911.  The grandmother got guardianship over the baby, thank goodness.
