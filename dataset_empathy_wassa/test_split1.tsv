The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	768	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	107	832	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	fear	1	6	3	36	40000	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	162	860	0.1578947368421052	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0263157894736842	0.0303030303030303	3.074889281869577	2.774841346826427	medium	low	An essay written by a 36 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

Underdeveloped countries are especially going to be affected by diminishing crops due to climate change.	fear	2	4	5	36	20000	2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0	3.429	4.0	2.286	3.714	66	891	0.2	0.0	0.1	0.2	0.0	0.3	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	2.749433470175913	2.7319525585037603	low	low	An essay written by a 36 years old asian/pacific islander female, went to college, with an income of 20000$.

Apparently, as anyone can see, guns are causing more harm than good in all communities. Perhaps since this fatal shooting involved a cop with possible mental issues it will put the spotlight on both issues.

Only so many resources in this country and unless we want to become another 3rd world country we have to send them home. Make them wait in line just like any other legal immigrant. Why should they be given special privileges to be in this country. I hate to be mean but if you aren't here legally then you have to go home.	anger	2	2	1	63	35000	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	85	908	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.8174712560409447	2.745288765434228	medium	medium	An essay written by a 63 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000$.

It was long just an unspoken or open secret that everyone basically knew, but it's good that it's finally coming to light with people willing to speak up, especially the victims. If they didn't speak up, people would go on thinking that this kind of stuff only happens in TV and movies.

They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life?

It's a wonder that man doesn't spend all his money that he has earned. I don't think he even got a chance to tell anyone what kind of person he is. He gets torn down before he has a chance to do anything. I'm just so mad at the whole election system and the way things are done.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

Granted I agree lead is bad but then again some Govt. clown probably needs to do something to justify the 6 figure income they make.	anger	1	6	1	61	18000	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	3.286	1.571	3.143	3.143	106	942	0.1111111111111111	0.0925925925925925	0.1296296296296296	0.0185185185185185	0.0185185185185185	0.1851851851851851	0.1666666666666666	0.1296296296296296	0.0925925925925925	0.0555555555555555	0.0454545454545454	2.5210077066756127	2.4342672173624527	low	medium	An essay written by a 61 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 18000$.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	135	943	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

Yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an American, raised here from the age of three and facing deportation for missed paperwork? This is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit.

These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man.

Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate.

A lawyer with a history of being a nut job went crazy at the mall in Houston Texas and shot nine people, and one of them was injured critically. And all this just because of some issues he was having where he worked, like it is so hard for a lawyer to just move on to another firm instead of going crazy and shooting up innocent people.	anger	1	5	1	54	16000	1.0	7.0	1.5	1.5	2.0	2.857	2.857	4.2860000000000005	1.0	71	993	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.7688883458290983	2.769655818090209	low	low	An essay written by a 54 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

Authorities think it was a robbery but the church is convinced it was due to him being a human rights activist.  It sucks that it happened but in all fairness Mexico is a shit hole and well known for cartel actions such as this.  How many of your peers have to get abducted and killed or tortured before you learn to shut the fuck up or get the fuck out?

It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	134	1068	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

ALSO, he blinded a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL. What the fuck is wrong with this guy.

Too bad for some giraffes that live there as they will be displaced. Of course I could really care less about giraffes 5000 miles away from me. Still I wish the giraffes the best I suppose. Brits are such weasels it figures they would look to kill a bunch of giraffes for their own selfish gains.

A populace that is so uneducated on health and nutrition that they don't know that it's mathematically impossible not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet.

Just having a shocking video that raises awareness doesn't help the problem from starting, just helps us react to it quicker.  We need to keep building programs that are designed to support our children, but we need to do it before they start to bully (or be bullied).  So many of our anti-bullying stories talk about standing up to them and bullying back...that is not the way!	anger	2	7	1	35	80000	7.0	5.5	3.5	7.0	5.5	4.0	1.857	3.857	3.857	86	1128	0.2352941176470588	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.9571737496092334	2.9271423921088875	medium	low	An essay written by a 35 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000$.

I've discussed this with my friends before, the poachers are generally low status people, trying to feed themselves, and they're selling to the highest bidder they can find. Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation. One day, we'll look back and see all of the greed killing rare animals purposefully, rather than the crappy way we move them out of their territories naturally as humans.	anger	1	4	1	30	50000	3.5	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.714	94	1130	0.16	0.12	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.12	0.24	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.0	2.886237767856457	2.829857670206246	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	120	1133	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	108	1161	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

I believe most police officers are good people, but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many police departments. The protests were certainly justified. Police should be subjected to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism. Those that do need to be removed from active duty immediately.	anger	1	7	1	30	76000	5.5	1.5	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.857	3.571	3.571	2.857	71	1162	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0333333333333333	0.0625	3.0866674371720566	3.032050342681197	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000$.

I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.	disgust	1	4	2	27	35000	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	124	1178	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0	2.962235586257199	2.972241786915248	medium	low	An essay written by a 27 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000$.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit.

That are coming forward towards this guy. This man needs taking off of the streets and put in jail. The things he did to multiple women is disgusting. I feel bad for these women who did not come forward in the beginning. Whether they were scared for their lives or just ashamed. It seems like alec could get a girl but just took things to far and to the next level. It ashame that a successful young man does something like this and ruins his entire life.

The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF. The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place.

She is very brave for telling her story and for just being a survivor.	disgust	2	6	3	30	25000	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.571	4.2860000000000005	105	1244	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.0256410256410256	0.1282051282051282	0.0	3.096453479940636	3.0635524369202405	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000$.

Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare.

I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	disgust	2	6	1	26	47000	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	76	1261	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.883259260990456	2.922690528251083	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 47000$.

In the UK they found that red squrriels are getting leprosy and that never happened before. The article also mentions that Armadillos get leprosy also which I didn't know. I always thought it was a disease that only affected humans and mostly in biblical times although I guess it is not an issue now just because we learned how to top it from spreading.	surprise	1	4	1	68	74000	4.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.286	3.714	4.0	3.714	77	1294	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.0714285714285714	2.736569952830773	2.488222767644316	medium	low	An essay written by a 68 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 74000$.

Perhaps it felt threatened? Maybe it was abused? Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way.

About 80% of the people are dissatisfied with his leadership and want him out.  But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.

It is about how Iraqis found evidence of torture by Islanic State in mass graves near the city Mosul.  Can you believe that, they literally just killed and dumped bodies there.  From what the articles says in just one hours time they found 20 to 25 bodies.  Some where hard to even tell if it were human or not.  They still can't figure out how they died but they will soon enough.  Though from the state of decomposition it has only been a few weeks that they have been there.

It takes place in 2011 and is about an inmates at a federal prison that had to choose between living with a violent cellmate or end up in shackles.  In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?   I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.  The guy that the story is about is serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking and assaulting a corrections officer.  This prison is known as the toughest prison and I can see why.

Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

That is ridiculous to let people suffer all because they won't put up some barriers to block the elephants.	joy	2	2	1	36	91000	5.5	6.0	6.0	6.5	4.5	4.0	2.714	3.286	4.857	99	1430	0.1379310344827586	0.1724137931034483	0.0	0.1034482758620689	0.0	0.1034482758620689	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.726770514114011	2.677676845932949	low	low	An essay written by a 36 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 91000$.

He was the epitome of the starving writer, it seems. His popularity continued to grow as he aged, and he was able to reap some rewards, but it didn't really catch up with his needs until recent years. He was a Buddhist monk, too. Had no idea.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	116	1451	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	150	1452	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000$.

I feel pretty sympathetic towards the family, they lost a great man. I am glad he made so much music cause his stuff will live on forever.

A girl ran into a police officer with her car, while taking a nude topless selfie to send to her boyfriend. Feel a little bad for her, even though she should not be doing this, especially with a glass of wine in her cup holder haha. Guessing she was drunk, which is the main crime here. She had a bond of 2000 dollars I believe. I kind of want her to be freed haha.	joy	1	6	6	23	55000	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.0	1.857	3.571	3.429	88	1482	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.2941176470588235	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.697369532579177	2.6690779831844447	low	low	An essay written by a 23 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

These kids can grow up to be so many things if properly educated and yet it is squandered away.	anger	1	2	1	30	30000	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	64	1628	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	2.8708430414064163	2.8150672315792225	low	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

He was totally within his rights and it was highly inappropriate and inconsiderate of that woman to have an unleashed dog running int he park.  The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.  Somebody needs to do something to stop this problem.	anger	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	92	1630	0.1764705882352941	0.1372549019607843	0.0196078431372549	0.0196078431372549	0.0784313725490196	0.0392156862745098	0.2352941176470588	0.196078431372549	0.0980392156862745	0.0	0.0	2.813755507142617	2.83128708638088	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.	anger	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	133	1618	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.221881368561005	2.153175165945004	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me.  I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.  These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence.

The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	anger	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	93	1616	0.1956521739130435	0.1521739130434782	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0652173913043478	0.0652173913043478	0.217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0	2.746293485206892	2.898086076746432	low	medium	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.
