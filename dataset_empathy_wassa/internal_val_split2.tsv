However if they're going to have that reputation they need to be prepared to deal with the number of individuals who will try to come. It feels like so many of the problems these refugees are running from have been created at some point due to US/European colonization and intervention, so I'm glad they're at least trying.	anger	2	6	1	28	68000	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	4.0	3.571	3.429	4.428999999999999	2.0

You have to stop and think how this can be affecting these said animals. Public access to wild animals in their natural environment can drop birth rates and even cause death to the animals. They can become endangered and some people even go as far as to hunt them.	neutral	1	4	1	25	50000	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them. Suddenly, one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist. Authorities have See.	neutral	1	4	3	32	50000	3.5	3.5	5.0	3.5	3.5	3.143	3.143	3.286	2.857

Whether it's kings demanding that they get to deflower any bride before her wedding day (as a law) or our own United States government attempting to strip more and more freedoms from us when we're already slaves... These are the acts of corruption.  These are the acts of cowardice, scum-bag gangsters that wear suits.	disgust	1	2	1	34	59000	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim.

For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0

Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out.
