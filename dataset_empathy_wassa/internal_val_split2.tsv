It's bad enough to know that i am eating an animal but to know it suffered makes it worse.  While the story is about the the suffering of an animal at the end of it's life it seems to ignore the suffering that the chicken goes through 99.9% of the time it is alive.  This kind of story makes me want to go vegan.	disgust	1	7	1	35	50000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	2.571	2.4290000000000003	3.143	3.857	82	1237	0.1538461538461538	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.990335411546433	2.872520062209296	medium	low	An essay written by a 35 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	148	245	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.911129203084617	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	768	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

On the other hand a victim's situation will not be improved or reversed because their perpetrator has been harmed in the same way.	neutral	1	4	1	37	72000	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	67	673	0.1785714285714285	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0833333333333333	2.607597671774005	2.7896595154919823	low	low	An essay written by a 37 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief. My instinct is to say ""good riddance"" and not go out and loot a liquor store and burn down fast food restaurants."	anger	1	4	1	43	48000	6.0	3.5	2.5	3.5	7.0	3.429	1.0	3.571	2.0	128	912	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1323529411764706	0.0441176470588235	0.1323529411764706	0.1764705882352941	0.088235294117647	0.0441176470588235	0.088235294117647	0.0	2.74352981791107	2.868292820400893	low	medium	An essay written by a 43 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000$.

As long as officers get blasted on news or the internet for illegal actions, people are going to look for ways to retaliate. Its an extremely volatile situation no matter how you look at it.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	132	1185	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2	6	1	45	30000	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	98	1425	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

It sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species. They will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the wild.

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2	4	1	33	60000	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	138	1478	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.3928571428571428	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.6999825947228584	2.461963714232384	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	116	1451	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	136	1040	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.

Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned.

Maybe in the end this will turn out to be a good thing for this baby, one can only hope.	sadness	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	82	60	0.0285714285714285	0.0	0.1142857142857142	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.2285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1578947368421052	2.797429426498891	2.813086318734232	low	low	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

Hopefully the murderer accused of five counts of murder will not be free and quiet in the streets of this country. I hope that justice can compensate a little to the relatives of the victim. After a 24-hour chase the police found the criminal and even though the victims have not been recognized, they will soon discover who they are.	fear	1	5	1	23	53000	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714	76	752	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.125	2.8975328080832194	2.956373350953746	low	low	An essay written by a 23 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 53000$.

But often times we forget about the many pressures and responsibilities that come a long with that.  Take Mikhail Lesin for example.  The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.  I guess thats a price you have to pay if you make enemies in the world.  You are either looking over your shoulder all the time or completely stressed to death.

I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of.

Then again, given Commiefornia's stated desire to secede, they might get to live their third world dream.	anger	1	4	1	43	48000	6.0	3.5	2.5	3.5	7.0	3.429	1.0	3.571	2.0	98	1059	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0	2.53773651416536	2.480229954236326	low	low	An essay written by a 43 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000$.

The stress and fear that is being shown from the younger generation is mostly to blame on social media. We used to be able to discuss political issues in person, calmly. Now, if you try to mention your opinion on social media, you run the risk of being attacked or insulted, simply adding to the fear of the current political situations.	sadness	2	6	1	30	49000	5.0	4.0	2.0	5.0	1.0	3.143	4.857	5.0	4.428999999999999	75	170	0.2	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.890436244933617	2.843861832521348	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

I'm distressed about this news because they're still searching for survivors. There's been a report that 9 are still missing. I hope they're able to find these unfortunate victims. It was horrifying reading about the accounts because people could be heard screaming and shouting for help. I'm hopeful that they can help find any remaining survivors. This is such an unfortunate event. The cause was due to bad building construction as the developers have cowardly gone into hiding. Experts said a recent drilling underneath the building triggered the collapse. This is horrible to hear. Could you imagine if this happened to the office building we worked out? Such awful and careless planning resulting in lost lives.	sadness	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	131	158	0.171875	0.0625	0.046875	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.21875	0.140625	0.109375	0.03125	0.054054054054054	2.654382900017872	2.620798586011236	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	108	353	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.
