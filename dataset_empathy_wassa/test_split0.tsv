My husband is a US Army soldier that fought to take over Mosul the first time at the cost of many lives.  And through incompetent measures in our government and military, we let go of Mosul and are again trying to figure out a way to take it back.  It makes me sad that there are people being oppressed in the world but it is also clear to me that at what cost do we fight the oppressors and pick a whose side to be on.  Maybe we should worry about ourselves stateside and stay out of the mess in the middle east.	sadness	2	6	1	42	75000	5.5	4.5	5.0	3.0	3.5	3.571	2.286	3.429	2.857	112	4	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1304347826086956	0.217391304347826	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.0	2.9336311653669185	2.867076307171067	low	low	An essay written by a 42 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

This is the same place that got hit with an 8.8 a couple years ago.  Remember that one?  That was so sad.  It triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed.  Not to mention the fact that there were 220,000 homes lost.  One piece of good news at least, since the 8.8 earthquake, they have put in a warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis.

I feel so bad for Kesha because she simply became a victim of the music industry and lost her voice in the process. Dr. Luke should be ashamed of himself for treating Kesha so badly and trying to make her into something that she wasn't. I'm glad that she got the help that she needed and is making strides toward her own recovery.	sadness	2	6	1	27	25000	5.5	4.5	2.0	5.5	2.5	2.857	3.714	1.714	2.0	76	33	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.0	0.1304347826086956	0.217391304347826	0.2608695652173913	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0769230769230769	2.790258159000976	2.6919993570228464	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000$.

It's everyone that is not part of the Alt-White movement. Jewish people, LBGTQ people. Black people. It is fueled by hate and ignorance. Trumps Muslim ban did more harm than good!

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	136	66	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.

I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals.

How could they just blatantly violate people in this way?  I suppose it is hopeful that we might learn from this, correct mistakes, but that doesn't mitigate the harm that was done!  It also doesn't bode well that protecting the victims now, after the fact, also seems to be in question.  The assumption that they were informed of the release of the data, I think, is reckless.  Verification that the already suffering victims won't be further victimized is as important as the far reaching implications of the data itself!  I wonder why there is no mention of the ramifications to the department either.

I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

They used the personal stories of a couple of people to show how the ready availability of guns contributes to sad situations in which kids are shot and killed. It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.

I don't think giving them more information on these dangers will stop them, but patrolling the waters and turning these human traffickers back will.

I feel mostly bad for the birds and sea life, which will obviously be affected.  You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.  Or even those areas that rely on tourism, if people can’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches.  Not sure what the answer is, or if there even is an answer to it.

Just like a child animals depend on us if we have them caged either let them out of the cage or take care of them why is that so hard for people to understand or do?	sadness	2	5	1	33	39000	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.5	5.0	4.0	2.286	2.857	4.143	125	146	0.12	0.12	0.1	0.08	0.04	0.08	0.16	0.14	0.1	0.06	0.04	3.264785149329033	3.2194530115569258	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 39000$.

When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.

While I do feel glad that apparent justice will be served in this case, this just goes to show you how violent some people can become when you toss religious ideals into the mix.	sadness	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	111	163	0.2	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0444444444444444	0.0444444444444444	0.0444444444444444	0.2888888888888888	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0222222222222222	0.0454545454545454	2.964130315479896	3.0560530596495203	low	low	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.

The elevator company has to be at fault here, but that won't bring her back! I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

These people don't deserve these health problems.	sadness	2	6	1	23	50000	4.5	5.5	3.0	2.5	5.0	3.143	1.714	3.429	2.571	60	179	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1052631578947368	3.101603762743574	3.0136632848456024	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

The worst part about the localities that disregard the lead levels is that either they are fabricating the test results or not being fined at all. I just don't see that things are going to get any better under Pruitt ( he really needs to resign). I just can't see the EPA fining or shutting down water systems that are non compliant. I am terribly worried, not only for the children of Flint, but for All the children who are still drinking water with high lead levels.	sadness	2	5	1	57	28000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.0	3.857	4.0	110	180	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1578947368421052	0.3157894736842105	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0	2.4169953819621224	2.467450928961579	low	low	An essay written by a 57 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 28000$.

Just wanted to say “stay safe”. Hopefully, that guy that shot at the police officer the other day and whose gun they say was used in some of those unsolved cases, was the killer. If so, his reign of terror is over. How sad that those people died for what appears to be just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I just don’t understand how someone can take the life of another unless their own life is being threatened. Who knows though? The killer could be mentally ill and think that perfect strangers ARE threatening them!

Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	141	182	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

According to UNICEF, there is a simple vaccine that can be given, which would stop children from being affected.  It affects most children in poor countries, which is very sad.  The vaccine isn’t that expensive and you would think that the leaders of all countries would get together and do something about this problem.  It is not just up to the USA to stand up and do something.  These other countries (even though they are poor) need to get more educated and help protect their own children and citizens in their own country.  It is sad that children and others have to die because we can’t coordinate with each other, to get the vaccines to those who need it most.

It makes me sad because we don't know the long-standing implications in the largest perspective.

Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being.

It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country.

Who says that the 'house-mom' idea is right? The gender gap needs to close, and the wage gap. Women are not paid as much as men.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	140	216	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

As a gun supporter maybe I should take a step back and ask myself the hard questions about guns and there impact and availability in today's society. I know that statistically more people die from other causes compared to gun violence, but are guns way to accessible in America compared to other countries? When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today? Seeing so many mass shootings makes me feel that maybe it's time to change some of the gun laws and help make things like 40 children killed or injured a thing of the past.	sadness	1	4	1	30	30000	6.5	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.0	5.0	2.571	4.714	5.0	127	219	0.2391304347826087	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.2608695652173913	0.1521739130434782	0.0217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	3.0509959156563773	2.9239883097345247	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 30000$.

This is an area which has hopes of dramatic infrastructure improvement and new jobs.  Many people and organizations have invested a lot of money and now have to wonder whether they should continue to invest in an area which may be destroyed by rioters.  It's so sad to hear about these beautiful farms and nurseries just being gutted and destroyed.  The farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do.  The farms are gone.  It sounded as if some of the elders in the community tried to calm things down, and it worked in some areas, but other areas just raged on with riots and destruction.  Can't these people see that they are ruining their own future?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	142	229	0.09375	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.21875	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.09375	0.0	2.93826874122984	2.7491767324843663	medium	low	An essay written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.

It seems dishonorable.	sadness	1	7	1	47	54000	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	95	244	0.2045454545454545	0.1136363636363636	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.1	2.8232895502322544	2.7214361762141253	low	low	An essay written by a 47 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000$.

Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	148	245	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.911129203084617	low	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

An elderly man was killed and the suspect is now barricaded in his house.  There was a lot of misinformation early on about it being related to the election and that the suspect was a woman.  It's being reported now that both those claims are false.

I was just reading this article about a family of 3 young black boys who went through foster care and ended up in prison later on in life, and it made me want to share it with you.  It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter. What do you think? Maybe we could write some letters to get people thinking about this situation!	sadness	2	4	1	35	50000	5.5	2.5	3.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.0	3.571	4.857	148	280	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0526315789473684	0.1842105263157894	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.074074074074074	3.246560590338013	3.032030563239074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

I say good for them. The animals can't fight back, but hopefully the army can deter poachers. I know the poachers do it because they can make a lot of money, but I just don't understand it. Big game hunters/trophy hunters and poachers are one in the same to me. I think they are both ridiculous reasons to harm or kill any animal. The anti-poaching armies have a scary, but, I think, extremely necessary job.	sadness	2	4	3	33	60000	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857	100	315	0.1470588235294117	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.088235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.088235294117647	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	2.5173461724462487	2.5196251834516903	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

A lot of innocent people are getting a raw deal, here.	sadness	2	6	1	27	25000	5.5	4.5	2.0	5.5	2.5	2.857	3.714	1.714	2.0	58	346	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.7478748969917017	2.6331785024084624	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000$.

She killed herself after a long suffering of depression. She repeatedly looked for for professional help and because ""missed opportunities"" she decided to kill herself. It is hard to imagine someone would be refused this kind of help after so many referrals. The professional mental health services have admitted the error and said lessons had been learned and changes have been made since the tragic loss of the journalist. It's sad that there is such a price needed to pay for changes to be made."	sadness	1	6	1	41	37500	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	112	347	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.1162790697674418	0.0	0.1627906976744186	0.2093023255813953	0.1860465116279069	0.0465116279069767	0.0697674418604651	0.0	3.12441313738808	2.926721244251021	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 37500$.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.	sadness	2	2	1	60	74000	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	119	348	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0263157894736842	0.0526315789473684	0.2631578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.1842105263157894	0.0526315789473684	0.032258064516129	3.0560606384819984	2.928518977113584	medium	low	An essay written by a 60 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000$.

It stated that boy was helping his dad harvest food when he fell in this well that was only 1 foot wide and that no adults could fit in it to go down and rescue him! Can you even imagine what that father must have been feeling knowing that his little boy fell in this well while helping him and he could not get down there to help him! I just imagine how heartbreaking this whole situation must have been for the family and for the rescuers who spent days trying everything they could to get to him and potentially help him.

However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	108	353	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

This article puts a lot in perspective, but I really struggle with the quote by the Mexican foreign minister saying that Americans chose racism and hate. Don't group us all in one category. We didn't ALL choose this clown to be president. I understand their fears and stress, but that comment really just rubbed me the wrong way. Hopefully both countries can maintain their ties until he's out of office.	sadness	2	4	1	44	17000	7.0	5.0	1.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	1.429	3.286	3.857	88	363	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.2592592592592592	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0	2.675901146164777	2.614201030646672	low	low	An essay written by a 44 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 17000$.

It is so sad that these young people have to take their life because they think there is no end in sight. What we need to do along with providing therapy for those that are bullied is to increase the consequences for those who are bullying others. This may have happened in Europe but in America teachers know this bullying is going on and they tend to protect the football players and other jocks. It is really sad.

It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through.

This is pretty upsetting for me as I am in love with these animals. They are wanting to cut down most of the forest. This place is in Indonesia and this company is also planning on building a drainage canal from the north to the south side of the area for which some work has already reportedly began. I really wished there was a way we can help and protect this land. You would have thought that this would be an important area that needed protected. I mean there are what about any where from 750 to 1750 orangutan..They're classified as endangered now.	sadness	2	2	1	39	74500	3.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	4.5	3.714	3.143	3.714	4.428999999999999	126	396	0.08	0.04	0.16	0.16	0.0	0.28	0.16	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.05	2.9398653069933567	2.8069664063590203	medium	medium	An essay written by a 39 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74500$.

Clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so unbearable that they are willing to risk their own and their families' lives to try for a different life in another country, with no guarantee that life there would be an improvement.  Its difficult to understand.  Life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance, which I suppose is something difficult for the typical American to picture.

It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern.

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention.

We can try to figure out what's going on and make a plan to stop, but nature is going to always come out ahead no matter what.  nature always has its balance and you can't stop that from happening.  If you do attempt, you're just going to cause more propblems than what it's worth and nature will still rule in the end.	sadness	1	6	1	35	3600	6.5	5.0	1.0	7.0	6.0	4.714	1.429	2.857	4.571000000000001	74	412	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6462764236515195	2.5189608275079687	low	low	An essay written by a 35 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 3600$.

It sounds as if his son could have been more disturbed than originally thought at the other arrest.  I would be devastated if I felt so threatened by my own child that I had to resort to violence.  I mean, how terrible it must be!  Though details aren't completely clear, it sounds as if the son had some issues that weren't completely dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad.  How terrible to have to carry this with him the rest of forever.  It would break my heart in two.  I hope he gets deep counseling for his grief and guilt.

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	141	425	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.0416666666666666	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.

Although I didn't really have much concern for the article I just read, I hope that these protests will end in South Korea.	sadness	2	6	1	47	86000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.286	2.571	4.143	58	428	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1428571428571428	2.2958993913078416	2.0537603714597483	medium	low	An essay written by a 47 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 86000$.

This is tearing my heart out and I can't get the images of what must have happened out of my mind.  You know that I was in the military myself and it makes it that much harder on me.  I can't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel.  From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.  It's so sad.  It's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the enemy, but when they get taken down by friendly fire?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	153	430	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.0238095238095238	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.1666666666666666	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0416666666666666	2.823035210555863	2.75481605525656	medium	medium	An essay written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them. Unfortunately, it's very sad to say, that even if a citizen is innocent, if they don't cooperate to the fullest, the police can physically harm them, even possibly lead to being shot and killed. This is very scary!

My political views are different from most.  I find myself disagreeing with many Republican and Democrat stances.

I had heard about the lack of water supply in California but I hadn't heard anything at all about the suffering in Nevada also.  It seems that lots of Nevadians, especially the Native Americans who own land there are in trouble from the lack of water.  With everything dying, it is difficult for them to keep animals alive.  Is it also causing problems in families. Who would think that lack of water would be the cause of violence, abuse, and neglect.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

Someone hit a trailer that was pulling people on a highway. Several people were injured, but three were killed. Authorities say that the three killed were related to one another. That is so sad and breaks my heart. It was most likely a family, a mother and her kids, or a father and his kids. It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened. The article did not say if the driver who caused the accident was drunk or on drugs. I wish people were more alert while on the road. Accidents like this are completely preventable.

They might be sad about the pets but I am sure they feel fortunate that no people died in this fire.	sadness	1	3	1	37	25000	7.0	6.0	2.0	4.5	4.0	4.571000000000001	3.143	5.0	5.0	63	461	0.3684210526315789	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.9095158165246238	2.69038163804059	low	medium	An essay written by a 37 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000$.

Some of them did not want to leave and now they can't get out at all. There are barely any medical services at all. Hardly anything to help with all the old age medical conditions that show up later in life. These people don't have enough food. They are scared they will die alone. I don't think many people have thought about this. I am so heartbroken for those people. I wish I could help them. Syria is such a mess. I pray somehow this can all come to a end soon. Too many deaths have occurred. These older people never thought they would have to live like this. Everything was normal until the war for them.  I think more people need to know about the older people living in Syria.

I guess that several years ago, the government came up with this program to get internet and technology in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet. However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do.

I feel bad for the animal as he or she didn't have to live this way. In addition, it was difficult to find treatment for the rhino, so I feel bad for the veterinarians that had to take care of the rhino.	sadness	1	6	3	24	55000	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	64	478	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	2.9739506359875407	2.828287851119073	medium	medium	An essay written by a 24 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point. As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase. Those in opposition, who feel that it's just an umbrella word to funnel monies in areas that are not needed. That believe Mother Nature and the natural state of how our Earth and it's environment works, are also somewhat correct.

They went to a theme park to enjoy themselves and their parents were killed in front of them. It was a water ride, the kind that seats six at a time. Something mechanical happened on the ride. The maintenance check a few days prior was good, but something screwed up. There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad.

There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.

I read that  Syrians and Iraqis are granted asylum in Germany far more often than Pakistanis, and Nigerians. Germany is confronting the task of deciding who gets to stay. If you’re from Syria or Iraq, sanctuary is almost guaranteed. But if you’re from Nigeria or Pakistan, chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing.

The economic crisis that is happening there is not only affecting people, but also the animals that live there. Especially in the zoos. We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos. Many animals have suffered for weeks.	sadness	1	4	1	25	50000	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	141	499	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.974944276653888	2.956256016531595	medium	low	An essay written by a 25 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

There are so many reasons why we should be using fewer resources as it is constantly destroying our environment and it is unfortunate that there are people who just continue to deplete our resources without a care in the world.

We only see things from our side of the pond, and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do, as a country.  We tend to think of things, in generalities, and lump groups of people who live in a common area, into one pile of terrorists.  There are plenty of people in Afghanistan who are against eh taliban, and we dont see the damage that we are doing by hitting them with drone strikes.  Most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the conflict itself.  There are always conflicting stories about the death tolls.  I believe it is used to de-escalate our fears that , we, as a country, are doing something that could actually turn out to be very harmful instead of helpful	sadness	1	2	1	34	20000	3.5	6.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	4.143	3.857	3.714	3.714	154	512	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.2368421052631578	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0476190476190476	2.9280240380790694	2.852237829890981	low	low	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 20000$.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	154	514	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	151	517	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	120	579	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens.

Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1	6	3	30	30000	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	134	613	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat.

It may be negative, such as a feeling of uneasiness, or positive, such as a feeling of trust.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

After the outbreak in Flint, I can see for their concerns.	fear	1	6	1	44	14500	6.5	7.0	6.5	2.5	4.5	3.429	1.429	3.714	3.143	60	751	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.3	0.0	0.4	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.0	2.814898034165869	2.657307693028217	medium	low	An essay written by a 44 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 14500$.

Hopefully the murderer accused of five counts of murder will not be free and quiet in the streets of this country. I hope that justice can compensate a little to the relatives of the victim. After a 24-hour chase the police found the criminal and even though the victims have not been recognized, they will soon discover who they are.	fear	1	5	1	23	53000	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714	76	752	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.125	2.8975328080832194	2.956373350953746	low	low	An essay written by a 23 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 53000$.

It shows a deepening divide of racial tensions in America, which is something I thought we had finally put behind us.  That being said, I mean that the racial tension is coming from BOTH sides, not just one side or the other.  BOTH sides need to be held accountable for their actions and the divide they are creating in this country.	fear	1	6	1	33	75000	7.0	3.5	2.0	4.5	4.5	3.857	3.0	3.714	3.571	75	753	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0769230769230769	2.653750256549198	2.724894134965422	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.  I hope that she gets better security in place so that this never happens again.  The article mentioned her providing information about her expensive diamond ring on Facebook - I think there's a lesson to be learned about that.	fear	2	6	1	58	40000	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	79	754	0.0294117647058823	0.088235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.2058823529411764	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.0625	2.748191450461277	2.422881137452516	medium	low	An essay written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.
