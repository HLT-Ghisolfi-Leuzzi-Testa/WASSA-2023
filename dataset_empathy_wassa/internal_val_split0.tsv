Dakota's dad, Steven Fanning, just filed for divorce from his wife, Heather, citing irreconcilable differences. Their kids are both of age, so child support isn't an issue -- Dakota's 22, Elle is 18. As for spousal support, it's as a bit of a mystery.

How wonderful to be the first Chinese woman to be a fighter pilot and then how tragic to be killed in such a way. I have so much respect for trailblazers and it always seems like such a waste for them to be taken from us in such a seemingly meaningless manner.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1	6	5	31	75000	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	115	1256	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.

I do have sympathy for some of the prisoners who may not particularly be terrorist. From an article I read some of these prisoners or most of them are mentally ill. One thing I learned from this article I read is that some of the psychologists may be assisting with torturing the prisoners. Some believe that some of these physicians and psychiatrist should bear the brunt of the blame for torture at Guantanamo Bay.	anger	1	6	6	27	50000	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	2.5	4.571000000000001	3.571	3.571	4.0	95	945	0.1428571428571428	0.2	0.0571428571428571	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.3541344589540354	2.407856294561003	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.  These Arabs and Persians are just so passive and impotent with their overlords.	anger/disgust	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	133	2054	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0	2.5408346036547678	2.471799664988035	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why.  But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event.  People there, trying to survive.  People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead.  People angry.

Not only is it terrible that adults are using these ridiculous medications, but now they are allowing their babies to get into them and harm themselves.  It's just outrageous, and they need to have stronger penalties for these people who are letting this happen.  There is simply no excuse.  Your drugs should be up in a cabinet locked far away from your children IF you choose to have drugs like that, which you really shouldn't be taking around a child anyway.

But often times we forget about the many pressures and responsibilities that come a long with that.  Take Mikhail Lesin for example.

Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.

However, it is clear that there were so many problems with the company, including the CEO, that the company has been doomed for a while. It's a shame the company was so poorly mismanaged. Maybe if they had a different CEO, they would have been able to survive.	fear	1	6	1	38	50000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	62	863	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.1904761904761904	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	2.576060778992088	2.3912535729375057	low	low	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

Perhaps it felt threatened? Maybe it was abused? Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way. I can't imagine another reason than that. And the people were fine anyway.	surprise	1	6	1	26	63000	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.714	1.286	4.428999999999999	4.714	107	1299	0.238095238095238	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.2857142857142857	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	2.527182778133081	2.51467573003539	medium	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000$.

There has been so many instances of men prevailing in their sport that it is now time that women do the same. Sports have been men's things for so long and I am happy to see that there are women joining the ranks of these top athletes. I am so proud of my species and how we have come so far in equality. I love that there are more even playing grounds now.	joy	2	4	3	34	30000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	80	1466	0.0	0.0	0.24	0.2	0.04	0.24	0.0	0.04	0.04	0.2	0.3076923076923077	2.766631234719572	2.7334006408967904	low	low	An essay written by a 34 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 30000$.

They are a cowardly, spineless bunch who fall in line behind Trump every time. Let's hope they get a major butt whooping in November. But this article demonstrates how we can't take anything for granted. I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again? We have to keep an eye out and do whatever we can to make sure there's no funny business at the polls in November.	anger	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	137	1151	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	2.460287618742973	2.437005306812205	low	low	An essay written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.
