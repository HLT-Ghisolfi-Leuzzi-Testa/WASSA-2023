I have never even thought about taking one. But maybe thats just my age or generation. Anyhow another idiot taking a selfie got attacked by a snake. Seems like selfie taking affects the brain or at least the part of brain. I have heard about people getting in fatal car crashes while taking selfies, and falling off a cliff, and being fatally attacked by bears, lions, etc etc. Now a python."	disgust	1	4	1	68	74000	4.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.286	3.714	4.0	3.714

I don't particularly care what happens to most prisoners, let alone the violent ones that attack each other and guards. There is no reason why any guard should ever have to put themselves in danger. These aren't people, these are violent animals, and the guards should be protected. They aren't the ones being punished for what is likely a severe wrongdoing. Restraints, solitary, whatever it takes, I don't feel one tiny twinge of sadness. And lawsuits?

I am very saddened by the turmoil in the middle east. Often I think about how we got here and why it got so bad and blame the powerful and privileged countries, including mine, have caused these conflicts. It feels like it will never end, a hopeless situation. I feel powerless to help anyone over there myself, I can only vote here and hope for the best in the end.

I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.

Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""  But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.  Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible.

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.
