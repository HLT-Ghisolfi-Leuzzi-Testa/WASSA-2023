1.0	5.375	Why isn't the EPA assessing fines for violations?   So presently you just get a violation but no repercussions.   Another example of ridiculous wasted government who sits on their behinds and doesn't do their job.   I feel every year we need a completely new group of employees in every division in the government.   It's ridiculous.   The next most treasured commodity will be clean water everywhere. 	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	62.0	29000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	1625	0.1304347826086956	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.2608695652173913	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0	2.205519278651328	2.35818603504778	low	low	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 29000.0$.

1.0	2.125	I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	1629	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.2258064516129032	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.0666666666666666	2.7327701042089507	2.750775429656553	low	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

He was totally within his rights and it was highly inappropriate and inconsiderate of that woman to have an unleashed dog running int he park.  The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.

2.0	3.875	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	1631	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.4230769230769231	0.1923076923076923	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.3201376604620663	2.411814748980693	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	1643	0.108695652173913	0.0652173913043478	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.108695652173913	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0344827586206896	2.715918480761497	2.6570584722039	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

1.5	1.0	After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for all the Muslims that are currently living in America. You feel bad for them because of what they are going through and all the discrimination they are facing. It's unfair that the ones that are innocent are being stereotyped as well and lumped into the same group as the terrorists when not everyone is like that.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	67	1658	0.1304347826086956	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.0869565217391304	0.217391304347826	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.0	2.773331792361034	2.6748813770719777	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

It breaks my heart these people are subject to being afraid of such violence and brutality. The women that were raped and especially by there government is nonesense and cant believe in 2019 this is still happening. They need to create a more civilized society over there. Even aid workers who are just there to help were brutally raped that tells me these people have no consequences for actions and to consious of human suffering.

Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.

A group like that should not be able to operate online and influence people to harm themselves. This is just so wrong. 	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	110000.0	7.0	6.5	4.5	5.5	7.0	5.0	2.143	3.571	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	58	1674	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.4166666666666667	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.9325149548792484	2.936662131886812	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 110000.0$.

3.8333333333333335	4.625	I just read about this family that got killed in a car wreck and it was just horrible. It's one thing when part of your family dies, but apparently the husband had already died a few months previous and now the mom and two of the kids are dead, too, and that just leaves one kid who I guess was about five or six. She's all alone now. :(	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	1675	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0	2.7567831508952634	2.7597499306807727	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

Eating is one of the basic needs of survival and it looks like there families are trying, but they just can not afford to pay for food. Seeing that supplies for school cost five times the monthly wage was outrageous.

Although this incident is pretty old news, it told of the unrest in Charlotte after a black man was killed by the police. In the protests, someone (not a cop) fired into the crowd, wounding a civilian and four police officers. It's just a sad commentary on where we're at with race relations in this country.

6.0	6.0	This story was so sad and heartwrenching. I guess the elite are not pardoned from bad things happening to them and this shows that. It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces. I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison. How could you kill and burn someone and for over something so minecule like getting hit on. Karma will get back at them and I hope in a grand way.

5.833333333333333	6.75	"This story makes me feel very bad.  I've never understood wanton cruelty like this, sadism it seems.  Harming something simply for the sake of harming it.  I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""  But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.  Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible.  I imagine the guy breaking the flamingos long neck.  Just pointless and awful."	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	132	1691	0.173076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0961538461538461	0.0576923076923076	0.0192307692307692	0.0576923076923076	0.1923076923076923	0.1346153846153846	0.0961538461538461	0.0192307692307692	0.0	2.324884154231575	2.217994296942771	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I can undertand people who commit sucide but to kill the whole family even the dog that is just evil. I think more help and mental reach out should be offered in communities to men. They bottle things up and this is what happens. Men are not allowed to show emotions and then they let it out in violence. I wish this woman had been able to escape sooner her and her children would still be around. 	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	109	1692	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.943237187453388	3.005735861126108	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

This river was a main source of life for everyone and it has been ruined forever. I feel for the guy who said it feels like he lost a family memeber a life lost because its been a source of life for so many for so long. It is very unfair that the clean up is so slow going and that they are taking so long to fix there wrong. I also feel bad for the fish who died because mud was stuc in there gills its such a slow painful death.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened.

The thought of innocent creatures starving to death in cages really turns my stomach.	sadness	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	72	1706	0.09375	0.09375	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.09375	0.21875	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.0	3.166018193251166	3.151796312214828	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

It is so sad that people need to keep children home just to line up to get food. They also cant afford to send them lunch and the government isnt stepping in to help which would be a good investment as they are the future of there society.Someone needs to step in send aid as teachers can only do so much they need to demand others to help out. Kids can not help themselves so they need others to step in and step up to help.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	119	1707	0.08	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.04	0.2	0.16	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.05	3.065617264630702	2.948851416859656	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I think alot needs to be done to make sure the river is restored and blockage is taken away so that this does not happen in the future. These fish cant move debris themsleves and i thin more light needs to shine down on what is happening so maybe a council can come together and monitor or take over and make sure the fish are in a thriving enviroment.

How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands.

Im sure the parents feel horrible and blame themselves that is very sad to me. 	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	117	1757	0.1351351351351351	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.027027027027027	0.1351351351351351	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.0	2.892813312581283	2.8111337357777257	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.833333333333333	3.625	Just read a story about a father who abducted and then murdered his two sons after being on the run from police. The article didn't give a whole lot of detail, so one has to wonder what drove him to take such drastic action against people who were so close to him. The suspect committed suicide afterward, so I think that it would be considered a crime of passion? Anyway, horribly tragic.	sadness	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	72	1758	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.0	0.1904761904761904	0.238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.0	2.979676494370094	2.936523970179397	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

This town needs some better traffic laws and maybe drivers licensure tests. It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt.

Perhaps better measures should be taken at this facility to be sure that they are identifying people correctly and that nothing else like this happens again.

It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story.

They should deserve the same respect that younger people do  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	1774	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.2	2.808877255829768	2.6888543107819545	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Why not do unto others as you would have the do unto you?

4.5	4.75	I can't imagine being a fourteen year old kid and losing my eyesight; that's just so sad. I don't think it's right to fire at people who can't defend themselves, and the fact that it sounds like they're using pellet guns with new shapes just to cause more damage is awful. I hope that girl gets more help in the future.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	61	1792	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0909090909090909	2.73215041031511	2.586165888136522	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?  Anyway, this is sad news although life does go on and it is the way of the world I guess.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1793	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0714285714285714	3.1599866108917123	2.9280750923268544	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made.  I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?  I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	101	1795	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.2727272727272727	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.575663440164933	2.451092105291401	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react.

It was nice to see the extremes people were willing to go to in order to try and save her but knowing that is necessary is tough to take.

1.5	1.0	I found it a little hard to relate to this situation.  It seems so far away and I can't really connect with any of the people involved.  I'm really sad for these families and their children.  It seems like they are in a difficult position without much option or anything they can do about it.  I hope they are able to find some resolution or some solution, but it doesn't seem like much is going to change there anytime soon.  I don't think this is the problem of the United States and we should remain uninvolved.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	96	1809	0.2	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0833333333333333	2.666290778706452	2.374205714153719	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Kids were in a trailer and a truck plowed into the back of them.  It was extremely disturbing to read.  I could just visualize the pain, suffering, and panic that was taking place.    I can't imagine losing 2 of your own children.  Further reading showed the driver had lost her husband.  Whoever was driving the truck will have to live with this the rest of their lives.

Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.  Even though they're dead bodies it seems lonely that they'd be there without getting taken back to civilization.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	103	1812	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1538461538461538	2.4462914634871504	2.375091147128485	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

There should definitely be a thorough investigation.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	5000.0	3.5	5.5	1.5	3.5	4.0	3.429	2.857	3.429	2.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	59	1824	0.1142857142857142	0.1142857142857142	0.1142857142857142	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.1142857142857142	0.1142857142857142	0.1142857142857142	0.0857142857142857	0.0	2.046263231018877	2.0324290537651506	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 5000.0$.

Someday i hope more aid is sent to help countries like this fix the problems at home so so many people dont want to flea	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	123	1841	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.1052631578947368	3.089548601351175	2.9714635395870657	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I don't see the need to deforest anyway.  That just seems destructive to me for no reason at all.  It seems like it is best when we just leave the environment alone and stop tampering with things and intervening.

I think this is out of anyone's control and really just an act of nature.  Sometimes thiings like this just happen and it's sad and a tragedy but no one can do anything to fix it.  The animals are the ones that suffer.  They are in essence having a drought and starving due to it which is really sad.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	1875	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.8849310643783848	2.787392770040721	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so.

I hope the scientific community steps in to correct the issue or many more animals will be harmed.	neutral	1.0	4.0	2.0	23.0	70000.0	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	91	1891	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.2857142857142857	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	3.0001018890559474	2.9366226342464863	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 70000.0$.

I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.

I wouldn't be surprised if drugs or alcohol were involved.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	65	1908	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0769230769230769	2.4794716861887816	2.314724141501331	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

2.1666666666666665	1.25	I suppose this is about an orphaned rhino due to poaching.  I had a hard time really feeling that much for the rhino.  It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.  I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	124	1925	0.1428571428571428	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1142857142857142	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0588235294117647	2.539101061992444	2.3531190403933007	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	1978	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them.

Those that are endangered should be removed. It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	34999.0	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	82	1994	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0833333333333333	2.7043999710322	2.709126651369151	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 34999.0$.

6.0	4.625	"What a mess immigration across the globe has become. It is such a delicate subject. Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all. In fact, Germany is in rapid negotiations with Afghanistan and other countries to repatriate those who have fled.

It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea.

Honestly, I can see taking any available route when desperate, but if your wife wants to leave you she is going to leave you.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	81	2027	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.813382783157359	2.7571828507063625	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.

6.0	5.125	I just read this horrifying article. I am actually not sure that I should even tell you about it because it was so disturbing. It was about this woman who was on the Dr. Phil show. When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it.

Even when tenuous peace is declared the governments that are installed by US interests are almost destined to fail.	anger/disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	67	2059	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.08	0.16	0.16	0.0	0.08	0.1	2.5480034117073003	2.586188632074898	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

Both the people and the elephants are being hit the hardest, not to mention the forests that are being destroyed. There have been 75 deaths of people and 30 deaths of elephants. People are having respiratory problems. Just imagine the children being affected. It's a travesty. People need clean air and water to live and it's like the government doesn't care.

That is something just scary overall to be quite honest.	fear/sadness	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	61	2076	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.2222222222222222	3.082035389208547	2.993734740982939	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

These men should never be allowed out of prison for this brutal murder. They just tossed his body in a shallow grave and went on with there lives watching a payperview game. And the murder was just because he wasnt interested in one of them romantically that is insane! somehting is clearly not right in both of there minds for this to be okay. I feel for the man who lost his life in a horrible way for no reason at all.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	2077	0.225	0.15	0.0	0.0	0.05	0.05	0.225	0.175	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.631674192240354	2.7570360410720007	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.333333333333333	5.875	I feel really bad for the rangers, who were just doing their job and were treated unmercifully by the villagers.  And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.	fear/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	2078	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	2.8106067462790105	2.6044920664133167	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

So many poor little creatures are at risk for this and that makes me feel so sad. They die such a painful death or have a very bad quality of life.

They must have been so afraid once the train started rocking back and forth. I wonder what actually caused this horrible accident in the first place. They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected. It seems to be a totally avoidable way to lose a life and needs to have more security measures put into place.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	2084	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.0	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.0	2.9275548134373968	2.9908286314467967	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	130	2093	0.0	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.4210526315789473	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.1578947368421052	0.0434782608695652	2.9105654631253968	2.8291657661711667	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again.

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status.

Over 5000 people kidnapped it really makes me feel for their families and hope that change occurs over there.	disgust	1.0	4.0	2.0	23.0	70000.0	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	2109	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0909090909090909	2.8611303239049057	2.920591590431385	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 70000.0$.

1.0	2.625	I don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	2110	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.  Just stupidness all around.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	2111	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.04	2.5847688753460147	2.4827858651419983	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

This is so unfair to this gentle giant. Treated to badly just to perform and make money. she is livign a horrible confined life of solitude. It is greatly disturbing that the givernment has the power to stop this yet has turned a blind eye. They need to take action and be an advocate for this poor animal. She deserves way better treatment then what she is getting now. How does anyone condone this or go to shows where this animal is chaned and obviously in pain and discomfort. 	disgust	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	116	2127	0.1428571428571428	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0285714285714285	0.0857142857142857	0.2285714285714285	0.1714285714285714	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.997361029335136	3.019464795573604	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Any aid workers and doctors are treated very poorly so theres not enough to go around how does this civilzation survive. Crazy how far behind and uncivilized some places still are in 2019.

4.0	3.25	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.

Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

And the terror of the people at the concert.  And the anger of the people afterwards who committed harassment and whatnot against Muslims.  All of the emotions I felt and was chagrined by.

I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world.

2.0	3.125	This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either.	anger/fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	2194	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.354431713055995	2.2336064560366857	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It is truly tragic that the awareness of the life-threatening and unsafe working conditions did not prompt immediate closure.

The formation of a council and the implementation of regulations, similar to the US's OSHA, should be prioritized to safeguard workers and ensure the strict adherence to safety measures for the preservation of human life. As a consequence of the failure to act promptly, families are now left without their sons, fathers, and a source of income that could have been easily avoided.

While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life. At present, families are left without their sons, fathers, and sources of income, all of which could have been avoided through a simple shutdown. I fervently hope for enhanced working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	148	2208	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.175438596491228	0.0526315789473684	0.2456140350877192	0.1403508771929824	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.032258064516129	2.938415829895253	2.8967542206162515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

While I understand the reluctance of some to travel and reside there, considering the high probability of death from airstrikes, it is essential that these individuals, at the very least, have access to fundamental necessities such as food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	166	2223	0.1509433962264151	0.0377358490566037	0.0754716981132075	0.0943396226415094	0.0377358490566037	0.1886792452830188	0.1886792452830188	0.1320754716981132	0.0377358490566037	0.0566037735849056	0.024390243902439	3.025683770249182	2.842196325336194	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

It is my ardent wish that we can address this issue within our country and work towards a resolution in due time.	hope	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	44000.0	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	70	2238	0.1612903225806451	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.0526315789473684	2.833435303669648	2.868621755589107	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 44000.0$.

The authorities and the local population are both driven by different motives: safeguarding the invaluable wildlife and its habitats, versus the villagers' potential reliance on the animal for sustenance or income due to their impoverished circumstances. I can envision the extreme desperation one might feel in a developing nation, where it could appear that law enforcement is depriving or confiscating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely attempting to safeguard and uphold what they believe to be just. They certainly don't deserve to endure such a vicious assault, and it astonishes me that they managed to survive such a merciless thrashing. I sincerely hope that greater efforts are made to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	130	2239	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	0.1904761904761904	0.0238095238095238	0.2619047619047619	0.1666666666666666	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0666666666666666	2.852581034531611	2.6664287201571537	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I empathize with both parties involved in this matter. On one hand, the police and the community are striving to protect the invaluable wildlife and its inhabitants, while on the other hand, the village likely relies on the animal either for nourishment or to generate income due to their profound poverty. I can comprehend the profound desperation one might experience in a developing country, where it could seem as though law enforcement is severing or appropriating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are simply endeavoring to safeguard and uphold what they perceive to be right. They definitely don't deserve to endure such a brutal attack, and it astounds me that they managed to survive such a savage beating. I sincerely hope that more measures are taken to assist both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	137	2240	0.1272727272727272	0.109090909090909	0.0545454545454545	0.1636363636363636	0.0181818181818181	0.2545454545454545	0.1454545454545454	0.0727272727272727	0.0181818181818181	0.0363636363636363	0.0666666666666666	2.899099343860642	2.690580284502506	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The police and the local population are both attempting to protect the sacred wildlife and its creatures, while the village likely requires the animal's meat or the funds from its sale, given their extreme poverty.

These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely striving to safeguard and do what is morally right. They don't deserve to be subjected to such a violent attack, and I'm surprised they managed to survive such a brutal beating.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I find this article deeply concerning. Despite the numerous movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that fewer women are pursuing careers or reaching senior positions because our society often stigmatizes hardworking women who choose not to have children. Moreover, it is evident that we still live in a male-dominated world, with women, on average, earning only half of what men earn, creating little incentive for upward mobility. By placing greater emphasis on girls' education in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to excel in math, science, and technology—an area where many women currently face challenges. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	131	2242	0.0	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.3636363636363636	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.125	2.7156766262428174	2.664707247296594	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I am deeply troubled by this article. Despite the progress made through various movements, awareness efforts, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading the way in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that the decreasing number of women in the workforce or in senior positions is a result of the societal pressure on women who work hard but choose not to have children. Additionally, the persisting gender pay gap, with women earning an average of 50 percent less than men, creates little motivation to strive for higher positions. By focusing more on girls' education and encouraging their participation in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in mathematics, science, and technology, which are areas where many women currently lack representation. The future instills hope in me that my gender will succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	146	2243	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.28125	0.09375	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.074074074074074	2.7804005154514253	2.7385652984624067	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself, I find this article deeply unsettling. Despite the multitude of movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women in America, it is disheartening that we have not yet achieved the top spot in all aspects of gender equality. In my opinion, one of the reasons why fewer women are working or reaching senior positions is the societal judgment faced by hardworking women who prioritize their careers over having children. Furthermore, the fact that women, on average, earn only 50 percent of what men do indicates that we still live in a predominantly male-oriented world, providing little motivation to strive for higher positions. However, I believe that by placing a stronger focus on girls' education and promoting their involvement in STEM subjects, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in fields like math, science, and technology, where women's participation is currently lacking.

6.0	6.0	Articles like this really resonate with me. I strongly believe that older individuals should receive proper protection and vigilant monitoring, as situations like these are distressingly common. Many seniors suffer from dementia, leaving them unaware of their surroundings and prone to getting lost easily. It evokes a deep sense of empathy within me, as I contemplate how devastating it would be if this happened to my own parent or grandparent. To imagine them wandering without a coat, feeling cold and frightened, breaks my heart. I am immensely grateful that these officers located her before any harm befell her. I sincerely hope that she can swiftly reunite with her family, and that effective safeguards are implemented to prevent such incidents from occurring again. Perhaps the family is currently overwhelmed, and she might require additional assistance, such as residing in a group home.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	141	2245	0.1428571428571428	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.2040816326530612	0.2040816326530612	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.074074074074074	3.0388711574548584	2.845329717073267	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It is incumbent upon us to take concerted action to prevent such attacks and shift our societal focus towards acknowledging the innocent lives lost, rather than providing undue recognition to the perpetrators.	hope	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	89	2253	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.3076923076923077	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.8172279719851665	2.720647485278486	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

I cannot fathom experiencing what this girl went through because I would never expect my parents to subject me to such circumstances. It's astonishing that they have been released from jail, as they appear to pose a significant threat to society by perpetrating such acts against their own child. It is my fervent hope that these individuals never come into contact with another innocent child. As parents, our primary duty is to safeguard our children, and this girl can never reclaim her lost childhood. It is difficult to comprehend how she could ever trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such trauma. Her mental state must be profoundly affected, and I genuinely wish for her to receive the necessary support.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	133	2254	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0384615384615384	3.1123587064547973	3.09501349531376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article evoked profound distress on multiple levels. I find it impossible to empathize with the girl in question because I could never envision my parents subjecting me to such a situation. The fact that her parents have been released from jail is truly unsettling, as their actions indicate a clear threat to society, especially considering they committed these acts against their own child. It is my sincere hope that these individuals never cross paths with another innocent child. Protecting one's children is an inherent responsibility, and it is disheartening to acknowledge that this girl can never regain her stolen childhood. The aftermath of such an ordeal would undoubtedly shatter one's trust in others and make living a normal life a formidable challenge. I pray that she receives the necessary assistance she needs to heal.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	135	2255	0.1267605633802817	0.1126760563380281	0.056338028169014	0.1126760563380281	0.0704225352112676	0.1549295774647887	0.1549295774647887	0.0985915492957746	0.028169014084507	0.0845070422535211	0.0625	2.928614356139758	2.8882576701593954	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Imagining myself in the shoes of the girl described is inconceivable because I could never fathom my own parents inflicting such pain upon me. The fact that her parents are now out of jail is incredibly disturbing, as their actions present a significant danger to society, particularly considering they perpetrated these acts against their own child. I fervently hope that these individuals never encounter another vulnerable child.

The idea of how places such as zzos and theme parks are filled with impressionable young minds who should not be exposed to smoking had never crossed my mind.

5.0	3.125	I find myself in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed in this article. It has shed light on a perspective that had not previously crossed my mind: the abundance of young minds in places like zzos and theme parks who should not be exposed to smoking.

By shielding the current generation from such influences, we can lay the foundation for them to make better choices and prioritize their health in the future. The proposed ban holds a real possibility of reducing the number of potential new smokers and eradicating the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I wholeheartedly support this ban and believe it will have no negative consequences if implemented.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	142	2268	0.0	0.0	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.2962962962962963	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0344827586206896	2.568658326668702	2.509329733274858	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.0	3.875	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

And yet part of me thinks that it's a problem of their own making.  These people are sheep.  Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.  Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side.  Why, thousands and thousands of years later, can these people still not create stable cultures?""An essay written by a 41 years old white male, with four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.
