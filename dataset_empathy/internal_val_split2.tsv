This polar bear suffered for the pleasure of humans.  Humane Society and animal groups are not ""on the job"" when this is even allowed to take place.  Laws must be in place when animals are used as sacrifice to human gratification.  Pizza is named ""polar bear"" for a reason.  They have a special habitat, and hunt for their food. the depend on sea ice and are marine mammals.  This should never happen again to a polar bear like Pizza, or any other animal be taken out of its natural habitat."	joy	2.0	7.0	3.0	50.0	80000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	2.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	128	1525	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.3	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0416666666666666	2.8624090642326654	2.638947970707997	medium	medium	An essay written by a 50.0 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

I am so happy that researchers are working towards making it more tolerable so that more people will undergo the procedure that can save their lives. I am happy that many different options are available: not all involving colon cleansing (e.g. X-rays), that there is a dietary advice to minimize the discomfort (which food to eat before the procedure), etc. So, the person’s quality of life, their well-being in the short term is taken seriously into account.	joy	2.0	7.0	1.0	45.0	120000.0	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	91	879	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.3125	0.09375	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.1	2.9894988919189727	2.864918305833841	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000.0$.

7.0	7.0	"Though all people who flee conflict can be called refugees, refugee agencies commonly distinguish between refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) to decide who is covered by international law and receives assistance and who doesn't. For the most part, little assistance reaches a person fleeing a conflict until he or she crosses an international border. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, distinguishes refugees and IDPs this way: ""When a fleeing civilian crosses an international frontier, he or she becomes a refugee and as such is eligible to receive international protection and help. If a person in similar circumstances is displaced within his or her home country and becomes an internally displaced person, then assistance and protection"	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	4000.0	6.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	3.286	3.286	3.857	2.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	121	426	0.2142857142857142	0.1785714285714285	0.0	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.0	0.0357142857142857	0.0	3.1685396313674024	2.856296202525571	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 4000.0$.

I used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the mouth over Obama being elected, and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending RIGHT NOW because a black man was in the white house. Now...I don't know. I see my friends and family freaking out and I want to tell them to just chill out. Obama didn't destroy America--the right wingers were wrong about that. Neither will Trump. Life will keep going. It brings a lot of stress listening to people freaking out all the time. And yet, I get it. I get why they are worried and freaking out. I don't like it either, but I don't get the point of stressing out so much. But then again, I've completely dissociated from all this.

I completely understand if someone was armed and the officers were in fear of their safety for them to shoot, but if a white officer shoots at an unarmed black man for no reason, that's wrong.	fear	2.0	2.0	1.0	29.0	45000.0	5.5	5.0	4.0	6.5	3.5	3.429	5.0	2.571	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	448	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.1875	0.1875	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0625	0.1428571428571428	2.885395359976715	2.9120173382724697	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 45000.0$.

I wish that I could help others more when I learn about a problem. When others are suffering I like to be able to help them get over it. I like to be known as a good friend to others who are in need. I have had situations in my life that I wish I had someone to turn to and I did not. That is the person I try to be for my friends.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	joy	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	30	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935160266587608	2.799303973765628	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	1400	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Just make sure you get yourself checked if you ever hurt yourself.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	63000.0	6.5	4.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.143	1.0	2.571	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	512	0.16	0.08	0.08	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.16	0.16	0.04	0.08	0.0	2.8697175543103426	2.603849018789944	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

7.0	7.0	While I do sympathize with the plight of back people and latest police violence, I think that they are not helping the situation by engaging in violent protests that take even more lives and create a great deal of disturbance in USA! These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals! They need to be psychologically stable and clear of racial bias, otherwise they are not suitable for this job!	anger	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	129	1168	0.1052631578947368	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.1403508771929824	0.0701754385964912	0.2105263157894736	0.1228070175438596	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.0701754385964912	0.0714285714285714	3.186521112139404	3.1287676426196693	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.

Things like this happened previously at a very alarming rate and continue to happen today even if it is less frequent. The problem with bringing these issues forward at a later date is that it is hard for these claims to be validated with so much time in between the actual act.

Teachers play such a huge role and it will not be good for the students to be in the middle of this.	anger	1.0	5.0	1.0	31.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	6.0	6.5	7.0	4.2860000000000005	4.571000000000001	4.714	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	71	861	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.1666666666666666	2.784564096956754	2.704560491443627	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

4.5	2.0	This article was quite interesting to me. It talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive. It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects.

You can't expect the gun to be blamed when it is someone who is just pissed off or mental ill. If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments. I just hope we finally wake up to the fact that the gun didn't do it it was the person holding the gun.

IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.

I did know that there was finally a democratically-elected government let by a woman who had been under house arrest for most of her life (and she won the Noble Peace Prize). I guess I assumed that any issues would have been addressed by that government. I had no clue that there was unrest and tension in regards to the Muslim population.

Well here is the crazy part apparently in Australia people who tossed their goldfish that they no longer wanted into a river. The goldfish have multiplied significantly and are now everywhere.

I noticed that some items from a company have made it to phase two trials through the FDA.  One is a food bar and the other one is a smoothie.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	1337	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	113	1283	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.3478260869565217	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.217391304347826	0.1428571428571428	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156656	low	low	An essay written by a 59.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500.0$.

The ruling class has a stranglehold on the wealth and the average person gets next to nothing.  The country is barely a step above a third world country in most parts, while the rich get richer and Putin profits.  There is not that much difference now than in the 70's and 80's except now the corruption is out in the open and there are billionaires all over the place.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	48.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	3.857	1.0	4.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	90	847	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.2	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.1	0.1	0.0	2.643909365586808	2.5293530636332973	low	low	An essay written by a 48.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Public access to wild animals in their natural environment can drop birth rates and even cause death to the animals.

But, on the other side of the coin, the chances are pretty slim of that happening.

1.6669999999999998	1.0	A hiker was lost in a Malaysian jungle for ten days. The hiker only brought enough food for one day. He survived on bananas and berries he found in the jungle. When he was found he was covered in leaches, weak, and very disoriented. Its a miracle he survived on his own for ten days in the jungle. There was no cell coverage in the part of the jungle he was in so he could not communicate to anyone or ask for help.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	44.0	26000.0	4.0	3.0	1.5	5.5	2.0	1.857	4.857	4.714	2.4290000000000003	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	83	1317	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0666666666666666	2.7219217018705306	2.5603514421534914	low	medium	An essay written by a 44.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 26000.0$.

4.833	5.875	Poaching seems to be a pretty big deal lately, like this year is the worst yet for rhinos apparently. It's really stupid. Wiping out species just so some rich asshole can have their special magic placebo. Didn't one species of rhino just go extinct? I wonder if this other species will die off before us too or if we'll be able to curb it.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	17000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	3.5	1.0	3.857	5.0	4.428999999999999	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	1491	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.2	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.1666666666666666	2.4043734438319104	2.3629515827903056	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 17000.0$.

3.167	5.125	Seriously, timeshares?! I cannot believe it is even an issue for someone to get relinquish their timeshare. These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong. If someone bought something like this for their family to enjoy but now their family is grown and gone, why should they have to continue with it?	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	50000.0	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	799	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0526315789473684	3.153873392385204	2.985655073145663	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

1.5	3.375	These numbers leave little room to think that climate change is not happening.  As you know, I firmly believe in the importance of environmental protections and think climate change is a problem.  However, articles like this only add to the problem.  These numbers are shocking on the surface but could easily be explained by natural fluctuations year to year.  I wish they would focus on balanced science instead.	surprise	2.0	7.0	1.0	35.0	80000.0	7.0	5.5	3.5	7.0	5.5	4.0	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	68	388	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.2941176470588235	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0	0.0555555555555555	2.734026147312112	2.681377397763914	low	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

1.167	2.125	I can't imagine what it must have been like for the people who were caught up in this, how helpless they must have felt. Not having any recourse for so long, no one doing anything to right the wrongs, just feeling like it's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so long and happen to so many people. Maybe they feel some kind of closure now though.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	12000.0	5.5	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	73	80	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.1	2.908835658545128	2.8626146696983894	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000.0$.
