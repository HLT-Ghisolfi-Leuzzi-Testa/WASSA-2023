There's also a similar bacteria called naegleria fowlerii that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain. Nature is fucking metal.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	17	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	2.9685028317594493	2.921429266234316	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

I feel like these pipelines are foisted on local communities without any care for whether it is good for the community and without adequate studies as to how safe they are from leaks and pollution.

6.5	6.25	I'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this. At first I was perturbed at the first article because I felt like the lady was being ridiculous. She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	19	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.745087308750816	2.573490038513232	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

I think there should be a major international effort to provide guidance for any nations in an earthquake prone region so that we can do a little bit to prevent more deaths when the earthquakes inevitably hit.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	65	33	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.1935483870967742	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.064516129032258	0.0555555555555555	2.9661019950283998	2.690205233736153	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

1.0	1.0	This doesn't sound too worrisome to me. If you are affected by depression, then you should decide as an individual to find another option. It's just a side effect, I think there are many medicines out there that have depression as a side effect. It is something that individuals should be aware of, but nothing critical.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	56	34	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.4	0.4	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.555989979550409	2.5030134589945705	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	36	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.901869276182453	2.975700762759283	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

Anyway, evidently she must be popular for some reason, because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand.

The article said the storm passed by Taiwan without actually hitting the island, which I suppose was a good thing, because evidently there was another storm in 2009, Typhone Morakot, that killed a bunch of people and did billions of dollars of damage. I'm glad I don't live somewhere where there's any inclement weather like that, it must be miserable to live on an island where it's hot and crowded.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	77	53	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1333333333333333	2.376774620047966	2.227403531246315	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.125	I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

1.167	1.125	So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

4.0	2.0	It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

5.5	3.125	I have pretty strong thoughts and feelings about this. From what I read, I feel like that is a very tragic situation. Us as a society, we are taking advantage of the trees we have here. In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	85	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0526315789473684	3.168803304379618	2.9649278441356337	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

5.667000000000001	5.125	This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	86	0.1063829787234042	0.1276595744680851	0.0638297872340425	0.1489361702127659	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.1702127659574468	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0909090909090909	2.9422282048245303	3.000730637576451	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

I feel really worried for animals that depend on the sea ice, polar bears I think really need it. Plus I read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and doesn't get reflected. Definitely something to watch and worry about.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	97	155	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1142857142857142	0.0571428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0	2.9149898360660176	2.632159364872854	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Where are the parents when the kids are out there fighting and attacking people in the street. Its just disgusting. I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	97	156	0.1666666666666666	0.1944444444444444	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0666666666666666	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will.

They were so young and had their whole lives ahead of them. I can't imagine how their families are feeling right now.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

This particular guy took it to the extreme by stealing their private photos.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	236	0.1020408163265306	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1020408163265306	0.1020408163265306	0.1224489795918367	0.1836734693877551	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0612244897959183	0.074074074074074	2.723743089360931	2.826668841531517	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

I often question how it is that I, another random human in this mixed up shit-hole we call ""Planet Earth"", can have unlimited empathy (to the level that I won't even squash a bug) and other people will go out of their way to run over an animal crossing the road. Humans can be rather sadistic and disgusting individuals.

1.0	1.75	Positions of power will ALWAYS, inevitably be taken over by a corrupt and greedy type of individual or group of people.  Any time you have a person who has authority over another person, eventually things will go bad.  Whether it's kings demanding that they get to deflower any bride before her wedding day (as a law) or our own United States government attempting to strip more and more freedoms from us when we're already slaves... These are the acts of corruption.  These are the acts of cowardice, scum-bag gangsters that wear suits.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	92	238	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.3333333333333333	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.0	2.6267976548718903	2.7109584805912745	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment. He slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase.	disgust	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	255	0.09375	0.09375	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	2.8849444849874755	3.057329181639548	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

The police officers who were with them ran away. “We, the rangers, were the targets.	neutral	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	106	270	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.9782039420410413	2.8460185325725846	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists.

But, you can rebuild your life with your family.	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	52000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	2.0	5.5	1.143	1.286	2.286	2.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	287	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.1944444444444444	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0	3.065326045874711	2.898565479393922	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 52000.0$.

The people that lost their jobs on Sally Jesse Raphael had families they supported. After being told the show would be renewed, it was a harsh blow to find out that wasn't the case.

Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

Further more, it is an ideology that promotes violence and terrorism. Until people become less tolerant of this disgusting dogma, things like this will continue to happen. If muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west, they need to work on reforming their religion from within.	sadness	2.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	24000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.5	2.5	3.286	3.143	2.4290000000000003	2.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	306	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	2.878356035645947	2.8620711569571	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 24000.0$.

It's something, designed by quacks, that is supposed to convert gay or queer people to heterosexual. Are you kidding me? People are who they are in life and are not to be changed, but embraced and supported. The regimen these poor people had to go through in this so called therapy was barbaric, and would not be used in North Korea as a torture.

2.667	2.625	I have a lot of sympathy for everyone worried about the Trump administration. I get it. They're not wrong to be worried. I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	31500.0	4.5	4.0	1.5	3.0	2.0	2.143	3.429	3.143	2.4290000000000003	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	339	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.0769230769230769	2.343570702841295	2.3702111880019787	low	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31500.0$.

1.3330000000000002	1.0	The article was about smokers and the prevalence of cancer among cigarette smokers. It indicated that the tobacco lobby results in weak tobacco control and a low effort among politicians to try and stop people from smoking. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I should care about smokers. The evidence is there for them to see, yet they persist in their bad habits. Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	92	340	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.497491729626756	2.4714053649337906	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

2.333	1.0	I have nothing against immigration, so long as it's done legally. I have nothing against illegal immigrants either and often feel there should be pathways to citizenship so long as the illegal immigrant commits no wrongdoings and contributes to the success of the economy of the place they are staying in. The problem with Calais in France is that quite often, terrorists disguised as immigrants make their way in through this area and then commit acts of terror which harm French citizens. French people want to help those that have been displaced in the Middle East, but Calais is a mess.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	101	341	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0344827586206896	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0555555555555555	2.6907088215470587	2.667309494402865	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

1.3330000000000002	1.0	The whole situation with Iraq and the uprising of ISIS can be attributed to the U.S. War on Terror and failed attempts at establishing democracy in the Middle East. The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

1.0	1.125	The article was about corruption at the International Monetary Fund, specifically the wrongdoing of former boss Rodrigo Rato. The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF. The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place. I'm tired of constantly hearing about people getting away with white collar crimes.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	343	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.0	2.60405044555625	2.5656593169863497	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

5.167000000000001	1.25	I just read about Arnold Palmer dying. He was a fixture on Sunday afternoons watching golf. I really wish that he was still around, I will miss him out on the course. He has always been around since I was a kid, even when he quit playing he would be out there for the major championships. I think it will be different watching them without him around. He was a genuinely nice man.	sadness	1.0	5.0	1.0	41.0	68500.0	6.5	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.857	3.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	73	355	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.277809831131449	2.2490915197032746	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 68500.0$.

1.0	1.0	This article about a firecracker going off during a protest is about the stupidest thing I have seen in a while. The journalists are pond scum trying desperately to write anything they can to divide people up. College kids can't bear a firecracker going off, they need to institute mandatory military service like Israel does, then maybe they would not be scared chickens crying about everything.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	41.0	68500.0	6.5	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.857	3.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	356	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.663602280383617	2.673045747264033	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 68500.0$.

I also think that the Irish girl did a cover of Bird on a Wire that I like. He did a lot of work and was an influence over much of the music scene. It was sad he got ripped off and had to work so hard to re-earn his fortune.

1.0	1.625	Another doom and gloom article about Trump. Not surprising, ethics and truth passed out of journalism long ago. Trump is not against renewable power, he just wants a free market and he is right. The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward. The Paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a boon for the liberals who dream of an elite class ruling the world.	disgust	1.0	5.0	1.0	41.0	68500.0	6.5	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.857	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	359	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.2857142857142857	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0454545454545454	2.831473924846536	2.785350695050864	low	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 68500.0$.

I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy. I hope you pray for the family with me!	sadness	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	129	371	0.125	0.1071428571428571	0.0535714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.0535714285714285	0.0535714285714285	0.2321428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0535714285714285	0.0952380952380952	2.9609031717256062	2.944341018489631	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

While the reef is mostly destroyed, it has sections that are coming back to life, and it can be stimulated back to recovery despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death stroke.

3.667	4.625	This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

For the most part, little assistance reaches a person fleeing a conflict until he or she crosses an international border. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, distinguishes refugees and IDPs this way: ""When a fleeing civilian crosses an international frontier, he or she becomes a refugee and as such is eligible to receive international protection and help.

It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

1.6669999999999998	6.125	I just read the article and I am so surprised that this happened. I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	149	455	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.1379310344827586	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.785816318850275	2.7220543145719054	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

6.0	6.625	I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway. I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

5.332999999999999	6.625	It's almost funny because I was looking at something really similar to this on Steve Wilkos, that a baby got hurt after pushing through a window screen and Steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so negligent and a bad mom but I honestly think that it's not the parents fault. Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	140	457	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

4.667	6.625	I don't really like coconuts, I think everyone knows that, but I still think that they play a huge role in our ecosystem. I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis. It just makes me worried about the environment overall because I really worry about global warming and I just really worry about the environment in general.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	143	458	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0344827586206896	2.758468311453905	2.5576228803693977	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	459	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.911129203084617	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	77	484	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.811145798313764	2.7370854918760794	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

I don't think the writer of the article understands the emotional weight of the situation, though, since they only seem to care about the fact that the dad that filed for divorce is good looking.	sadness	1.0	2.0	2.0	20.0	80000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	59	501	0.0625	0.0625	0.125	0.15625	0.125	0.125	0.09375	0.0625	0.09375	0.09375	0.0833333333333333	2.722281037890824	2.3690262386156973	low	low	An essay written by a 20.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 80000.0$.

7.0	1.0	I just read this really long article about a white man that actually got sentenced after shooting a black teenager dead. I can't help but feel incredibly satisfied after reading this. It happens way too much in this country where white people are able to get away with hurting black people. This time, it finally feels like some justice has been done.	sadness	1.0	2.0	2.0	20.0	80000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	502	0.0625	0.0625	0.15625	0.125	0.03125	0.1875	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.125	0.0833333333333333	3.0430283317469398	2.915997337559024	medium	medium	An essay written by a 20.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 80000.0$.

1.0	7.0	This article I just read is pretty disturbing. It's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a hot spring that fell into one that was way too hot, and was basically boiled alive. It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.	disgust	1.0	2.0	2.0	20.0	80000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	86	503	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0769230769230769	2.6271367247590587	2.6503267058899542	medium	medium	An essay written by a 20.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 80000.0$.

Apparently, the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below. Everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible tragedy it was. I feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again. You're suppose to have fun at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting hurt when you get on these rides. Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	63000.0	6.5	4.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.143	1.0	2.571	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	510	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0434782608695652	3.076003552971601	2.9289884995829376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

The answer is never to privatize or ""modernize"" the water system of a place, as that is really just an excuse to implement political policies. It is just bizarre that our modern water systems in urban areas are so woefully lacking. Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems."	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	45000.0	6.0	5.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	4.2860000000000005	1.714	4.143	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	84	519	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.791765169686607	2.616842025335621	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

Here in Detroit, we see it all the time and I know you're in a similar situation in Philadelphia. The article doesn't give any details about the victims or anything like that. It almost dehumanizes people, don't you think? I mean, these victims were somebody's relatives. Hopefully more details will come out in future articles. The news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details. I know I am rambling here.

6.0	5.625	Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

I think it's a few years old because it says the protests have been going on for five months, and I started following the Standing Rock case A LOT longer than five months ago. Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned.

Let's hope they get a major butt whooping in November. But this article demonstrates how we can't take anything for granted. I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again?

6.5	6.875	This article about post-traumatic stress disorder is disturbing on many levels. This country really doesn't take care of our veterans. Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	529	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.0416666666666666	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

You can't even go to the coffee shop without worrying someone is going to pull out a gun at you.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	82000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	4.714	3.286	4.2860000000000005	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	533	0.1212121212121212	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.2121212121212121	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.0	2.7340819003773658	2.853190648381526	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 82000.0$.

1.6669999999999998	3.875	I really feel bad for Turkey. I think they are trying to do everything they can to get rid of terrorism in the country. It seems that their efforts are for naught. They want to keep the people safe and yet more terrorist groups keep popping up. Then the lawmakers are involved and there is only so much you can do. Turkey is constantly at war. I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here. It is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want peace. There is always terrorism and someone trying to bring down a country, but the country tries its hardest to fight back despite opposition.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	82000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	4.714	3.286	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	129	534	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0555555555555555	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.7844872062063515	2.7601166472237884	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 82000.0$.

6.0	4.0	I just read an article about how Billy Bob Thorton felt about his marriage to Angelia Jolie. He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	44000.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	155	535	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.0434782608695652	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830317	medium	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

1.167	1.625	I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	541	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

My uncle died of prostate cancer and I know nothing will ever be the same. Cancer on such a young  boy seems so cruel if there is a God out there. I am really hoping their son pulls through and they keep on fighting together as a family.	sadness	1.0	5.0	5.0	31.0	80000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	5.0	1.571	3.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	71	567	0.1351351351351351	0.1621621621621621	0.054054054054054	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.054054054054054	0.1891891891891892	0.1081081081081081	0.1621621621621621	0.054054054054054	0.0909090909090909	2.9164589162538035	2.7572587518661487	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

4.333	6.625	It's really disturbing we have a president that enables all these terrible behaviors we are witnessing unfold before us. I am happy there movements like #Metoo  exist to show people that we will not tolerate these kinds of acts. It's like these people never had mothers or sisters. The way they act is beyond comprehension and I hope the media keeps exposing people who have bad intentions.	anger	1.0	5.0	5.0	31.0	80000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	5.0	1.571	3.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	67	568	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1333333333333333	2.844957953787493	2.978847945721378	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

7.0	7.0	Did you hear about the polar bear name Pizza called the word's saddest polar bear? Apparently they are not treating it well in China by not giving it enough space and turning his life into a circus show. He started to inflict self harm because of his living condition. I really hope China comes up with better animal cruelty laws although I doubt this will happen because of our culture difference. It makes me furious knowing animals are being treated like this over there.	anger	1.0	5.0	5.0	31.0	80000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	5.0	1.571	3.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	84	569	0.1764705882352941	0.1470588235294117	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.05	3.0345418197571146	2.936676661432647	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

They will be in poverty likely their entire lives, and it is just not fair.

That would affect a lot of companies and industries.	surprise	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	25000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	4.5	2.0	2.143	3.143	3.0	1.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	584	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.8197060474897544	2.6866165923329244	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000.0$.

Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	103	602	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.15	0.05	0.3	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.15	0.1578947368421052	2.808354938543694	2.7133308782499603	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	120	603	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

I don't like the cutting down of rain forests and believe that needs to end, but I think there are other answers.  Getting rid of a great food supply is not one of them.  Eating meat keeps us healthy and strong and may be the reason our brains grew to the size they did.  Many politicians would want our brains to start getting smaller and more compliant.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

I also think that anyone who is going to visit there should be made aware of the dangers of the elephants so that they don't get injured or killed like the 29 year old woman did in the article.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	6000.0	7.0	3.0	1.0	7.0	3.5	3.143	4.2860000000000005	4.0	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	101	618	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.977248293801868	2.930100108791477	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 6000.0$.

2.5	5.875	I just read this crazy article about Wells Fargo that I thought I would share with you. It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	144	619	0.0377358490566037	0.0943396226415094	0.1509433962264151	0.2075471698113207	0.0943396226415094	0.1698113207547169	0.0566037735849056	0.0566037735849056	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.064516129032258	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

I did not get too many details about all of the evidence that they have against her but to me at least it does not seem like they have that much evidence. I guess she ordered her friend a coffee before her friend got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died. Pretty crazy, right? I think she probably did it but their motive is weak and I do not think that she would have been found guilty if the trial was going on in the US.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	620	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.1818181818181818	0.1515151515151515	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.797317659848697	2.7629927272499057	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

And you got Liberal scholars defending immigrants, repeating that nonsense of, ""They don't break any laws!"" What the fuck? As a Mexican, I am appalled by other Mexicans defending this nonsense and seeing Mexico encourage this illegal immigration shit. Mexico needs to fix itself so that it can house people that won't want to run away from it. Fuck Mexico, they have ruined a lot of lives and they are not held responsible.

Yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an American, raised here from the age of three and facing deportation for missed paperwork? This is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit. There are those who come here, infest neighborhoods and take away jobs from hard working Americans and then there are victims of bureaucratic anarcho-tyranny like this. These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man.

The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	113	647	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	3.009758951199248	2.78106625686191	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.

It's probably not right of those who are discriminating and the airlines really need to do something about all the complaints.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	33.0	25000.0	7.0	4.5	4.0	7.0	7.0	4.714	1.286	3.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	97	682	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.9452949273074696	2.79399946822083	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

Was it so serious just because he is the mayor and would it not been so serious if he wasn't a mayor? Could he have done something better with the money?

Plus life is too short to wait in lines.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	39000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	3.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	698	0.1904761904761904	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.2857142857142857	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	2.707582992904581	2.7625882217291835	low	medium	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 39000.0$.

Well apparently it will not be ending any time soon.  It is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it.  There are organizations out there that is trying to prevent this and fight against childhood obesity.  The WHO organization is blaming video bloggers/vloggers who get paychecks from junk food companies.  They are claiming that they are more powerful than ads.  I'm not sure I believe that but it could be possible, you think?	fear	2.0	2.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	7.0	6.5	1.0	7.0	4.5	4.428999999999999	4.143	4.428999999999999	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	112	716	0.081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.1621621621621621	0.027027027027027	0.1891891891891892	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1891891891891892	0.0555555555555555	2.6671132964598665	2.595935447011908	low	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 50000.0$.

I wouldn't want to be a surfer there knowing that anytime my life could be in danger since you don't know what your surfing under whether its a huge shark preying on you waiting to strike and make you his fresh meal. I am always cautious when I'm in the water since people don't realize there are so many dangers deciding to get into the water.	fear	1.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	3.5	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.0	3.857	3.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	732	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0833333333333333	2.8903863753577483	2.7797794216501623	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

7.0	4.875	I just read an article discussing the impact global warming is having on polar bears. It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go. Anyways, you should really read this article. I told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed, so go read it.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	40000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	143	733	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.9289554973030567	2.763764590920136	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

Seriously, if you torture someone emotionally, how is that different from doing it physically? It's not. You're doing an insane amount of damage to someone's psyche, enough for them to commit suicide. Prosecute the kids bullying as adults, and start punishing these kids harshly enough to deter them from doing it ever again. Any adults aware and ignoring it? Charge them as accomplices to murder.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	40000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	85	734	0.1842105263157894	0.1842105263157894	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0	2.744841648284802	2.970128069680146	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.0	2.875	I read this article about what black people think. It is crazy that they still believe they are being targeted by the police. Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here. Let them try living back in Africa and see how they like that.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	63.0	35000.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	116	752	0.1818181818181818	0.1136363636363636	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.2045454545454545	0.1818181818181818	0.0227272727272727	0.0	0.0	2.893788157080626	2.823569269494842	medium	medium	An essay written by a 63.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000.0$.

I think I could survive in the woods like that. I know a lot about native plants so I would do pretty good. Of course as long as it wasn't some place cold. The jungle would be hard but only if there are wild animals that would like to eat you for their food.

Today with social media we just see the problems more out in front since nothing is private anymore. I'm older 63 as you know and my mom and granny taught me how to behave. Don't go into a room with some man you don't know. If he tries something tell someone. All these ladies who kept quiet or were paid off in some way are just as big a part of the problem as any man who abuses them.

These senseless acts are obviously those of cowards that have no regard for human life and should be captured and dealt with harshly.  There is not enough room in this world for people that would do this to others for any cause or religion.  I hope that everyone that can be saved and cared for is able to get what they need in order to recover physically.  I know that the emotional healing for all of them and their families will take much more time and help for these poor people that have had to endure such an atrocity.

Did you know he was afraid to sing really and hated being in front of all the people at first but obviously he got over it eventually. That makes him so relatable towards me. I feel pretty sympathetic towards the family, they lost a great man. I am glad he made so much music cause his stuff will live on forever.

It was not like super tragic but it just makes me think about my own life. It also makes me really think about my living situation. I have never thought about how I live in an apartment building shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences. For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control. It really freaks me out now that I know someone besides just myself could ruin my home or personal belongings. Even worse, someone could lose their life.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	50000.0	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	796	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.744424323629415	2.6927003226889843	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

3.167	5.125	Seriously, timeshares?! I cannot believe it is even an issue for someone to get relinquish their timeshare. These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong. If someone bought something like this for their family to enjoy but now their family is grown and gone, why should they have to continue with it?	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	50000.0	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	799	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0526315789473684	3.153873392385204	2.985655073145663	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly. I feel bad for the family of the victim and I hope they see justice done.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	44.0	49000.0	5.5	5.5	1.0	4.5	2.5	4.143	3.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	147	806	0.1956521739130435	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.1521739130434782	0.0434782608695652	0.1521739130434782	0.1521739130434782	0.108695652173913	0.0434782608695652	0.0217391304347826	0.0476190476190476	2.767285481580338	2.747451182835108	medium	low	An essay written by a 44.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.
