How much EXACTLY was spilled?  Birds are sensitive (I own a parrot and the slightest disturbance in her environment can be harmful emotionally, which means eventually it will lead to physical problems such as plucking and starvation).  So what the hell, BP?  I hate that they act like this is ""no big deal"".  It is a big deal and companies like this are the reason we are in danger of so many different world disasters."	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0	6.5	5.5	2.0	6.5	4.0	4.571000000000001	3.0	4.0	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	110	1574	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0465116279069767	0.0697674418604651	0.0697674418604651	0.1162790697674418	0.1627906976744186	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0697674418604651	0.0476190476190476	2.567924246086143	2.469195205206431	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

You can't expect the gun to be blamed when it is someone who is just pissed off or mental ill. If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments. I just hope we finally wake up to the fact that the gun didn't do it it was the person holding the gun. They could just as easily kill using their car or a knife	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	64.0	35000.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	4.143	1.0	2.286	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	161	1437	0.1805555555555555	0.1527777777777778	0.0416666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0416666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2638888888888889	0.0972222222222222	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0526315789473684	2.722580795501649	2.8464737001338443	An essay written by a 64.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000.0$.

1.0	1.25	This story specifically doesn't make me feel anything, since I don't know these people and I feel like if I tried to have emotions for every victim of a crime I read about that would just require too much mental effort. In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

4.0	2.0	It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

6.5	5.5	In this day and age, there should not be such a thing as airline discrimination. The only way someone should be stopped or removed from their flights is if they displayed violent behavior or if they were trying to board with weapons. It is not acceptable at all for someone to be barred from their flight due to the color of their skin or their religious or ethnic background. Those who have been discriminated against for these reasons are suffering undue embarrassment and inconvenience. They should be compensated for this unfair treatment and the airlines should be fined heavily.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1545	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.2692307692307692	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	2.930272373926084	2.893700873208173	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits.

To me it doesn't really matter as I never even thought about someone being a Jew until I got older. People are people. Jews are smart. Jews have always been smart at least for generations. Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate. OTOH people have a legitimate concern to fear that Trump being elected will cause problems like WW2 did. After all Jews tend to be Republican and likely donated a ton of money to Trump and they are more powerful today than they ever were.

I certainly feel for anyone looking for a better life and at times wish all countries had open borders as this one isn't so great at times but we do have laws and many immigrants enter other countries legally and I think there needs to be some sort of controls that make the process fair to legal citizens.

You were pregnant and carried that baby in your belly for 8 to 9 months. Some ladies are faced with a life or death even choice. We have to do what is right for our babies but mostly for ourselves. I know you think wow selfish much, No this i why. If you are not here you can not raise and happy healthy family. Next if you are not your best or at 100% you really can not give your all.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	39.0	74500.0	3.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	4.5	3.714	3.143	3.714	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	1356	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0666666666666666	3.074892392888611	2.837804178514744	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74500.0$.

This whole thing about getting an IUD now because Trump will make birth control unaffordable in the near future is ridiculous. Just another issue to get people stirred up. Most Trump supporters are conservative when it comes to economic issues but moderately liberal when it concerns social issues. Big changes in birth control, same sex marriages, abortion, and women’s rights are not going to happen. I would like to ask the haters how their lives have changed for the worse since the election!	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	66.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	3.571	2.4290000000000003	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	104	1092	0.1388888888888889	0.0555555555555555	0.1388888888888889	0.1388888888888889	0.0	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0833333333333333	0.0	2.773122807093213	2.6851332051134484	An essay written by a 66.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

3.0	7.0	Here is an article for you. It's an old one, obviously. I am so sick of Republicans. They are a cowardly, spineless bunch who fall in line behind Trump every time. Let's hope they get a major butt whooping in November. But this article demonstrates how we can't take anything for granted. I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again? We have to keep an eye out and do whatever we can to make sure there's no funny business at the polls in November.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	528	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	2.460287618742973	2.437005306812205	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

While they may not have the same protections that the accused have in the United States, they should still give her a new trial, something quiet, out of the public eye, maybe even outside of the country, where she can get a fair trial based on the facts. If there is video of her spiking the coffee, or any indication that she has had any contact with cyanide, then I say she should get a retrial.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	50.0	96000.0	6.0	2.5	1.5	4.0	7.0	1.429	1.143	3.429	1.286	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	1156	0.125	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.667586750609648	2.63781030308241	An essay written by a 50.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 96000.0$.

5.0	5.625	"I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate."	surprise	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	56	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.836929331372917	2.7158651048995046	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

White supremacists are dangerous people with crazy ideology. They promote horrible values to their sons and to the society, they are not respectful with other races and that hurt the society, specially here in United States that is a multi-cultural country. This groups should disappear from the map as soon as possible!

It also said that some of the fires were probably caused by arson, but didn't dwell too much on that aspect. The quoted official mentioned that dry conditions meant more fires could easily be accidentally started and that was a danger.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	30000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	1349	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0	2.6931184321277915	2.582940908664521	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

If someone says ""plant based"" anywhere near them they seem to automatically reject it. Agriculture is the main contributor to the destruction of the earth. It's not like people are preaching everyone go vegan, but drastically reducing your intake of meat would help the planet by a huge margin.

1.0	1.125	I read about this asshole Arcan Cetin who shot up a mall in Oak Harbor, Washington. Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.167	1.25	It's weird how I don't really feel sorry for these people. Timeshares just seem like a terrible idea and I've always associated it with conspicuous consumption. Really...just rent a hotel room when you can go. Buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a problem waiting to happen. But I can't stand how grimy the companies are and how they jerk people around. It just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people's pockets. And the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they don't want to play fair.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	943	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.0	2.544203069942621	2.5323531852857726	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

I think it's ridiculous that the premiere of B.C., of the awful NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they did the best they could in difficult conditions.  But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.  But what can be done about any of this now other than clean it up and try not to have it happen again.  Either way I don't care.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	1595	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.0	2.3727871896158867	2.299989383469657	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It's like its 1800's again in the U.S. and the rich are using the Southern Strategy to stop likely democrats from voting, using the divide and conquer strategy of trying to turn the people against each other instead of who they should be against. rich republicans.

A populace that is so uneducated on health and nutrition that they don't know that it's mathematically impossible not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet.

I dont expect it to change now.  Its hopeless because people are just ignorant, solipsistic apes.  I just cant care any longer about these idiots.

It actually made me a bit angry, because it focuses on police deaths form two years ago and doesn't take into account current figures. Also, by focusing on deaths alone, it completely glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is safe in the current climate. It feels a lot like fake news to me. All you have to do is pick up the paper to see how often cops are involved in fights with criminals and crazy people.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	105000.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1923076923076923	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0454545454545454	2.8774576499399567	2.7984443590899137	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000.0$.

There is so many things wrong with the American system of adopting children from other countries.  If we are going to adopt children from other countries as Americans, they should be granted their citizenship immediately upon being adopted. Before another adoption takes place that involves American parents, and innocent children from another country, there needs to be new rules, regulations, and laws mandated for the protection of these children and families of what can be deemed as a sloppy American adoption system.

Stupidity is being surrounded by so many outlets, professors, libraries, internet, magazines, and still refusing to learn about those that are different from you.	anger	2.0	6.0	3.0	28.0	35000.0	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	1133	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.3846153846153846	0.3846153846153846	0.0	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.656298210562152	2.681233949912142	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

Apparently they are not treating it well in China by not giving it enough space and turning his life into a circus show. He started to inflict self harm because of his living condition.

Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation.

I wish people would stop pretending to be concerned over things that they ultimately have almost no influence on, anyway."	anger	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	370	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0256410256410256	0.0	0.1025641025641025	0.282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.037037037037037	2.862843402460182	2.8337898914839985	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

I am not a fan of President Trump by any means, but I also have not once thought about comparing him to such a horrific part of the history of this world.  Jews should not be worried that there will be another holocaust or that they will have to go back into concentration camps.  I don't think the country would ever let that happen again, and I don't think that Donald Trump would go down that road either. He has a tendency to act like a child, but that would be a far stretch, even for him.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	114	433	0.1304347826086956	0.1304347826086956	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.0	0.0869565217391304	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0	2.370291908134794	2.4605822732488725	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

It was long just an unspoken or open secret that everyone basically knew, but it's good that it's finally coming to light with people willing to speak up, especially the victims. If they didn't speak up, people would go on thinking that this kind of stuff only happens in TV and movies.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

What makes people so mentally disturbed to think that this is ever okay?	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	50.0	30000.0	6.5	3.0	2.5	7.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	2.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	70	1476	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.2068965517241379	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.6347903394029317	2.8922508419610207	An essay written by a 50.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

1.0	2.125	I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	1629	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.2258064516129032	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.0666666666666666	2.7327701042089507	2.750775429656553	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of.

1.0	5.625	The article is misguided in many ways, and obviously only prevents one perspective on all of these very complicated issues.  I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.  Entitlement doesn't produce better outcomes; it produces more entitlement.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	1573	0.0285714285714285	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1818181818181818	2.568093060720685	2.4210217316585747	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I think that it should not be difficult for people to conduct themselves appropriately, so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	280	0.1	0.05	0.2	0.15	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.05	0.05	0.0434782608695652	2.495359342425146	2.493830002598717	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

I find the article describing it to be absurd, however.  Describing a Wildlife Services program in the way it did was over-the-top.  Besides, I always find these perspectives backwards: people who are seemingly more concerned about the welfare of animals than people.  If you want to champion something or complain about something, start with human problems.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	85	1570	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0526315789473684	2.536103766652039	2.347643351095987	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

I really hope this guy gets caught.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	21.0	45000.0	5.5	6.5	2.5	6.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	1.857	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	873	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.1538461538461538	2.719907331153744	2.911654186582832	An essay written by a 21.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

This influx of refugees will cause chaos on a massive scale. The USA should help. If we are willing to invade and contribute to the destabilization of the country in our own interests, we should also be willing to come in as a magnanimous gesture and help out these poor people in the time of their need.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	64.0	27000.0	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	851	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.9777133915114997	2.9144693197390708	An essay written by a 64.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000.0$.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Our original purpose was to fight Al-Qaeda which we accomplished  a long time ago. Then our goal was to kill Bin Laden, this was also accomplished a long time ago. This is a war with no end game.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	45.0	27000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.0	1.143	2.714	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	921	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.552837400447468	2.482237032310018	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000.0$.

A requester asks for an obnoxious amount of work and couples it with a short timer on the task.   Then they want the work for free and good feedback.  Do they get it?   Do they get good work for free? I dunno.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

They are just selfish people, wanting what they want and unwilling to compromise with each other.  Most actors and actresses are like that.  They are so self-centered.  I can’t stand people like that.  I feel sorry for the poor kid.  Although he will probably grow up to be a self-absorbed, selfish brat, just like his parents.  I swear that I think the less people have, the better off they treat their children and their families.  I have no sympathy for people like these rich snobby people.  They probably have their own jets, tons of money.  Yet, they still can’t compromise.

The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	116	283	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.3043478260869565	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.873318764423922	2.927632080674066	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.

Since she is stronger, she will survive, then they can bring her back to complete health, then do it again for the next 3 years, then keep repeating it until she dies. I can't comprehend why people like this do these things, but there is a special place in hell. I don't buy the mental illness garbage. OF COURSE she has a mental illness, but that shouldn't automatically imply protection from justice.

The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.

Being that our Country is held highly among-st the rest of the world, you would think that we would be considered with the environment just as much as everyone else. How can he believe Climate Change isn't real How is he allowed to just pull us from this deal we agreed to? It seems pretty stupid to me that he can just make these changes on his own free will.

I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to shame anyone into conversion therapy. I cannot stand Mike Pence and everything he stands for. He probably is a strong advocate because he is probably closeted! Why can't people just be ok with who they are?

You've got to wonder how long Europe is going to let refugees in when crimes such as sexual assault and such are on the rise and everytime they catch the person it's yet another refugee who came here to just keep living the same crappy way that ruined their home.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	35.0	145000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	1.5	7.0	2.286	1.0	2.4290000000000003	1.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	1568	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.2916666666666667	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.7995631843343136	2.7747062574950623	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 145000.0$.

4.167	4.5	Even though the situation is hard to watch, I am glad that more and more people are standing up to racism. This is a problem that many deny is even still a problem. It is uncomfortable to see the divide that these situations shine a light on but in the end it is for the greater good. There needs to be major reforms in the policing sector that will eliminate the racial profiling that goes on but I am afraid that more hard will come before the good.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	30.0	30000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	1553	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1	0.0666666666666666	2.7654963336202525	2.768946218107315	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 30000.0$.

This conflict is rife with airstrikes and drone strikes that drop on civilians and militants alike. Qatar is culpable in the slaughter of citizens, which puts them firmly against the Geneva Conventions. Of course, I do not celebrate the loss of their soldiers' lives, as their families back home are just regular citizens as well in all likelihood.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	81	1185	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.28	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.0666666666666666	2.88022313174472	2.6624138295437967	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

Either we champion free speech for those we find abhorrent, or we stop pretending to care about liberty. People will always suck. At a certain point, it seems we as a society have gotten a lot softer, even as life has become more comfortable. Racists are morons. Do I walk around stressed all day about racists?

2.0	1.0	I do think that this male birth control for men should be a thing. Men should be able to decide if those risks are worth the protection. Men should have the ability to take birth control in their own hands, as they never know if a woman is lieing about taking her's or if they have been taking it properly. An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing. Women, get over it. If your side effects from your birth control are too strong, then just don't have sex.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1474	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1515151515151515	0.0	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.78421836330545	2.6997879597824745	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

Maybe doing things collaboratively can help change things for the better.	anger	2.0	5.0	3.0	44.0	38000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	3.857	3.0	5.0	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	1102	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.1333333333333333	2.662611965235228	2.6075501035997326	An essay written by a 44.0 years old black or african american female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 38000.0$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	1286	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.
