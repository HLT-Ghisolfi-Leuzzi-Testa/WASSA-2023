I would hate to find out after all the worrying and not being able to reach my child that they had died on social media. It was very sad to read about and feel the father's emotions about his daughter.  I was happy that he found some peace with his lost.	sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	65	1814	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1470588235294117	0.1666666666666666	2.907365495275942	2.6998596258615595	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I personally believe that the guy is guilty, there are too many things that he did and said that did not add up.It seems that he wanted to get rid of his kid and leave his wife and live his free lifestyle. I do not see any possible way that he did not know that the kid was in the car.

They want to keep the people safe and yet more terrorist groups keep popping up. Then the lawmakers are involved and there is only so much you can do. Turkey is constantly at war. I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here. It is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want peace.

The fighting needs to stop and peace needs to be restored between these two nations.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	44000.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	537	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0666666666666666	3.049596949391324	2.808810254610562	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.

Even though you might have it rough, ultimately it is up to you to decide to break the law or use drugs or not.  So they had free will too and could have exercised that.  Regardless, it is still sad that they went through a rough childhood.

I wonder if they have relatives that might be willing to take them in. I wish the article had been more informative and told a more comprehensive story about what happened and why the children were spared when three adults were killed. Perhaps there was a spat between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a traumatic incident.

The doctors have even fled as there is no resources to help people anymore. Only once dialysis center left which will probably close soon for fear of people and lack of resources. Anyone with a chronic disease is just out of luck as medicine is few and aid cant even be reached to most of these people anymore.

No older people who worked there life so there familys can be better should be worried about war and losing the family. The doctors have even fled as there is no resources to help people anymore. Only once dialysis center left which will probably close soon for fear of people and lack of resources. Anyone with a chronic disease is just out of luck as medicine is few and aid cant even be reached to most of these people anymore.

Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?  Anyway, this is sad news although life does go on and it is the way of the world I guess.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1793	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0714285714285714	3.1599866108917123	2.9280750923268544	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.

No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating.

4.0	2.0	It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again.

6.0	6.625	I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway. I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

I think it's a few years old because it says the protests have been going on for five months, and I started following the Standing Rock case A LOT longer than five months ago. Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned. Even more so, it's their land and they have a right to tell the oil companies NO WAY.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	127	527	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0909090909090909	2.3415918761511447	2.2459037482964286	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

5.5	1.0	This is an incredibly sad story!  All these people out trying to have fun and then they lost their lives.  I imagine the fear when they were hiding, it must have been so terrible.  And the families are just as much victims as the people who lost their lives.  The whole thing is terrible, and all of this for nothing.  Terrorist attacks are the most senseless killing and loss of life.  It is really tragic to me, and these people seem to have no regard for human life or suffering.  IT's not even human.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1840	0.2	0.15	0.025	0.0	0.025	0.025	0.25	0.2	0.1	0.025	0.0666666666666666	3.152665014101456	3.012071373619983	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

1.5	1.0	I think it's good that some groups in Saudi Arabia are taking steps to give women more freedom.  It's obvious that women there are treated like second rate citizens and do not have many liberties, so anything that can be done to fix this is a positive thing I believe.  This is 2019 and there's no reason why a woman should need a male escort to do anything.  That sounds ridiculous to me as an American woman.  I feel sad for the women living in these nations.

It also has displaced so many people who have lived here. They have lost everyhting in the fire and i cant imagine having to rebuild or having the money to replace all my stuff and stuff thats irreplacable like pictures.

6.0	4.0	I just read an article about how Billy Bob Thorton felt about his marriage to Angelia Jolie. He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	44000.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	155	535	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.0434782608695652	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830317	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

Perhaps those refugees are out of choice, honestly they should come to a better country such as U.S. or U.K, even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration, but I think they're quite tolerate to people from war torn countries	anger	1.0	6.0	5.0	24.0	45000.0	4.5	3.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	2.4290000000000003	2.857	2.714	2.4290000000000003	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	90	5	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.701422763939612	2.6867837019241234	An essay written by a 24.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

They are nothing but innocent civilians but they have to be the ones that suffer the wrath of war and issues in the government. it's terrifying to not know where your home is and sleep whereever you can.

2.833	3.875	Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very upsetting and tragic article. It told the story of a young teenage girl in India named Insha Mushtaq. She lost her vision and 14 years old because she was shot repeatedly with pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for months trying to regain her vision, but so far it has not been successful. She is trying to stay positive now but she knows that she has a difficult road ahead of her. I hope that she regains her sight.	sadness	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	256	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.2580645161290322	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.1290322580645161	0.0666666666666666	2.9758361924049703	2.77316032274708	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

There were so many warning signs that were ignored where people could have intervened and gotten her the help she needed.  I just think things like this happen too often where people get swept under the rug and professionals and others overlook what should really be treated as major warning signs.  I think lives could be saved if people would be a little more attentive to things like this.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	85	1829	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.7802598234630875	2.714851696427175	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

The stress and fear that is being shown from the younger generation is mostly to blame on social media. We used to be able to discuss political issues in person, calmly. Now, if you try to mention your opinion on social media, you run the risk of being attacked or insulted, simply adding to the fear of the current political situations.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	49000.0	5.0	4.0	2.0	5.0	1.0	3.143	4.857	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	561	0.2	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.890436244933617	2.843861832521348	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

It's so sad that three soldiers lost their life due to a miscommunication, US is doing a favor to them by helping and they do not seem to fully appreciate that, they need to be more careful with their allies. 	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	4.0	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	1664	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1	3.09888344990843	2.949715331614104	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I feel bad for them and i also feel guilty as well because i know that i somehow contributed to that as well because it's not just one person's fault. I feel like it's a collective fault that we should try to fix to try and help out these animals before they go extinct.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	72	1787	0.1	0.15	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05	0.3	0.3	0.1	0.0	0.0	2.8356296302995325	2.704027149065053	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I really feel for this country as a whole. It is like they are getting attacked from every side. It has got to feel so on edge living in syria. You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react. You have 24 hours to leave everything you know and love and probably never see it that way again it is crazy.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	134	1807	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.9753202676376858	2.850512219244255	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.

I hope that this truly was a ""bad accident"" as described by the Sheriff, and not serious neglect or negligence or something.

The police officer presumably feels terrible, and I feel bad for him too, as long as the mistake was honest.  If it wasn't then I have no sympathy for him.

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

Although this incident is pretty old news, it told of the unrest in Charlotte after a black man was killed by the police. In the protests, someone (not a cop) fired into the crowd, wounding a civilian and four police officers. It's just a sad commentary on where we're at with race relations in this country. Even sadder: I don't see it getting any better any time soon...	sadness	1.0	7.0	5.0	41.0	64000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.571	2.143	3.429	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	83	1677	0.1851851851851851	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.0909090909090909	2.4645140680305877	2.555480265489926	An essay written by a 41.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000.0$.

For instance, the people-like the people in the story-whose livelihoods are being put in danger because of global warming.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	77	126	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.841397005345242	2.8286421250592	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

I hope something can be done for these woman. They need counseling. Medical help and lord only knows what all they need. But it should be provided by the government. 	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	50000.0	6.5	3.5	1.0	6.0	7.0	2.143	1.0	1.571	2.286	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	1745	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.1290322580645161	0.1612903225806451	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.3333333333333333	2.9470241551598497	2.9505402920808512	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 50000.0$.

It must have been a terrible and very scary way to die to be trapped in that well shaft for four days.  Also, the parents must have been beside themselves, I mean can you imagine?  It just sounds completely horrific and with such a terrible ending too.  It would have been much different if they had been able to rescue him but clearly that was not possible.  Overall this is a nightmare situation and one that no one should have to suffer.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	1788	0.1891891891891892	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.027027027027027	0.027027027027027	0.081081081081081	0.2432432432432432	0.1351351351351351	0.1351351351351351	0.027027027027027	0.0833333333333333	2.935105223288107	2.997791954066898	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

It is enough to get you depressed, read this so you can get an idea of how pollution affects third wolrd countries. Instead of going after industries (probably all American) with fines, they rather close schools because of the pollution and smog.

5.0	5.625	"I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate."	surprise	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	56	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.836929331372917	2.7158651048995046	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will.

I often think here in the US there is a great divide on how racial issues are dealt with, and the US is not the only one. There are many racial problems in other countries and that makes me feel hopeless for the future. If we can't fix the issues here in America, how can we critizice other countries?	surprise	2.0	5.0	2.0	41.0	60000.0	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	40	0.25	0.0	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.662395532568908	2.469137934827045	An essay written by a 41.0 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

They were mainly trying to escape from war and poverty but unfortunate events happened and they never made their way. Hopefully they find a better place in the afterlife. It's very unfortunate what happened to them.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	71	1725	0.2	0.1	0.05	0.0	0.0	0.05	0.3	0.2	0.1	0.0	0.0	3.049899414657366	2.703777875664926	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	1871	0.18	0.18	0.02	0.02	0.06	0.08	0.22	0.14	0.08	0.02	0.0454545454545454	2.667612087015073	2.756443482830526	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

So many innocent people and children are being killed for no reason, it reminds me so much of how the Nazi's treated the jews but it is happening now and nobody is stopping them. It's unbelievable and so sad, I do not understand how the world is letting this happen. 	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	4.0	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	68	1874	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.840126693963971	2.8685759357984955	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

And now we have to worry about when our men and women go out to train, that this kind of thing can end of happening at the drop of a hat. So, who is responsible after this? Who helps the children now without parents? Who pays for everything surrounding their funerals, and all of the costs after that?	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	37.0	29999.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.714	4.143	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	85	173	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.859666996591129	2.9911472751221986	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 29999.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.125	I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.	sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	55	0.2045454545454545	0.1136363636363636	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.1	2.8232895502322544	2.7214361762141253	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

They shouldn't be kept in captivity in these circuses and shows I do not think.  This seems inhumane and not right.  I would feel guilty going to a circus seeing elephants parade around.  Maybe at a zoo where they could be in a natural habitat it could be okay but not in a circus where they are supposed to dance around for human entertainment, that is just pitiful and sad.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857									98	2295	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0714285714285714	2.794337210450996	2.8168635977770826	An essay written by a 38 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

6.0	6.0	This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

The fact that Lina was returning home from church when they were hit makes it even sadder. I feel like they need to find a way to prevent these crashes although it is quite hard for me to pinpoint exactly what to do.	sadness	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	1739	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.9634668088634823	2.7469806392604177	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""  But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.  Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible.

6.5	6.875	This article about post-traumatic stress disorder is disturbing on many levels. This country really doesn't take care of our veterans. Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD.

1.167	1.125	So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I just can't understand how children and people in general can be pushed to suicide by what they read or are exposed to on the internet. Perhaps it's because I can't imagine harming myself that I don't understand the state that this people must be in. Suicide is such a tough situation and so hard to deal with. It makes me sad to think people target troubled souls and enjoy seeing the harm they do to themselves.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	1730	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.868074302673593	2.763227152971426	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

5.332999999999999	6.625	It's almost funny because I was looking at something really similar to this on Steve Wilkos, that a baby got hurt after pushing through a window screen and Steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so negligent and a bad mom but I honestly think that it's not the parents fault. Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	140	457	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

6.5	5.625	Honestly I do feel bad for him but at the same time you should not be taking a selfie around an animal that is clearly so dangerous. Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	459	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.911129203084617	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.

Mental health is such a problem, we need to find better ways to help people so they don't get to the point of harming others.  Whenever I hear about an officer being hurt I think of your husband.  We are very lucky men like him are choosing to spend their lives to protect us.  I hope we can get help to more people so I can stop worrying if there is someone out there waiting for him.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	35.0	80000.0	7.0	5.5	3.5	7.0	5.5	4.0	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	385	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0555555555555555	3.095331120296331	3.03383262802833	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

I think it's sad and scary for the wildlife in the area.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	110000.0	7.0	6.5	4.5	5.5	7.0	5.0	2.143	3.571	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	84	1769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.966567813922003	2.7646399611525028	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 110000.0$.

Orangutan are not just any animals, they are one of the smartest and closely related to us. I am sure, you would have watched some documentary where it is shown how evolved they are as a society and how familiar they look to us when caring for their children for instance. It is just so sad that this is happening and I wish we as a race would show more empathy and concern for these magnificent creatures.	sadness	1.0	6.0	5.0	34.0	36000.0	6.0	3.5	2.0	7.0	6.0	4.857	2.571	2.143	4.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1856	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0769230769230769	3.0272010702544856	2.9319253776027097	An essay written by a 34.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 36000.0$.

Good for the original photographer who is trying to help her out of this situation.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	24.0	50000.0	6.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.714	3.714	4.857	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	225	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0	0.2068965517241379	0.1724137931034483	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0	3.022863521306523	3.0163642509485613	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 50000.0$.

I guess the hope would be that others could learn from this tragedy.  Whether it was an issu with the jet itself or a lack of training, hopefully they can figure out what caused this tragedy so it can be prevented in the future.  I feel sad for her family and loved ones who lost a close friend.  Very sad and it sounded like she was a good person too.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1703	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2105263157894736	3.0251598682113885	2.737464984669599	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Hopefully people are more careful in the future.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	1702	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0833333333333333	2.712178415326699	2.5283778216311563	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

It's also sad how the police officers ran away which was I guess the main point of the person telling the story. That is very corrupt and wrong, they should have stood up for the Rangers being targeted. I think it's best if the wildlife is preserved and the community that attacked the Rangers were clearly out of line.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	480	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.706523654784907	2.598670371424574	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

1.0	1.0	Eh I don't have strong feelings about this.  I'm sorry about the passing of a person and sorry for their family's loss, but I disagreed strongly with her political positions.  So I can't say I'm especially sad or sorrowful for her.  I am sorry just in a general sense because the loss of a life is always a sad thing and I'm sad for the family members who were left behind to grieve her loss.

It's really sad that sick people would go online and prey on little children like this.  I find it shocking and hard to believe anyone would want to do such a thing.  They really need to find a way to crack down on these people and put them away for life.

Unfortunately we as a nation need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment.  Even worse is now we have a president who in his own words feel as though global warming is just a fabrication.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	281	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.

In the meantime, it is terribly sad that the living creatures must continue to suffer like this.  People eating horses for Meat?

""I just want to ask the security personnel who fired pellets at me what my fault was,"" Miss Mushtaq says, as she stands by the same window she was sitting at when pellets blinded her. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision. Nothing has worked so far, but she remains hopeful. Ms Mushtaq says she wanted to become a doctor before losing her vision. She brings out her text books to show me, and flips the pages though she cannot read them anymore.

Sometimes the articles have so many names of places I don't recognize and can't pronounce that I get a little off track of the point of the article. I gues those terrorists are using people as human shields to keep and take control or surroundings areas. They know this is against UN policy, but I doubt they care. There is always something going on in the Middle East, it seems nothing gets better for the people just trying to live. I feel like something should be done to improve the situation, but it's been bad since I was a kid and I doubt it'll get better.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	42.0	70500.0	6.0	2.0	2.5	4.0	4.0	3.143	3.143	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	331	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.51010399368267	2.339573797015446	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70500.0$.

I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	102	1755	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0909090909090909	2.7884964743490444	2.6457018966854022	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces. I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison.

I hope huge fines as assessed.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	62.0	29000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	55	1670	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.125	2.598592198099613	2.674763620801652	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 29000.0$.

It just seems like it's gotten unsafe to go anywhere public these days with large crowds.  The situation is obviously out of hand in France and it is bad in the United States too.  Everywhere really.  I don't trust the terrorists or Muslims and there are many other problematic groups as well.  The problem is with humanity and it is very sad.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	86	1746	0.15625	0.09375	0.0625	0.0625	0.03125	0.09375	0.21875	0.15625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.7546590942666374	2.625389778591462	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Please when you read this try not to get too sad about it because it will get you sad. Just try to find someone you love and hold onto them because we should not take for granted what we have.	surprise	1.0	5.0	5.0	27.0	100000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.571	4.428999999999999	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	71	110	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	2.95217258186844	2.8539110529048752	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

The article made me think about how good we have it in the United States and things that are happening to these people are only seen in movies.  To be shot dead on the spot for protesting or have more than half of your family missing because they were kidnapped would be horrible.	sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	1683	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0833333333333333	3.0618728069717576	2.9091666793012867	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.833	2.75	"It was sort of sadly ironic to see the part in there about ""we don't think he'll win"" considering what followed. All of it, sadly, still rings true, day after day. There's been no apology, only a doubling down on the kind of bile, arrogance, and ignorance that was on display since day one. I feel bad for every woman in the country who has to live with someone like that as their president."	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	12000.0	5.5	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	83	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.2608695652173913	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.53019083124816	2.544220419033075	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000.0$.

2.5	3.875	Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very interesting and somewhat disturbing article. It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	sadness	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	76	258	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0227272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.1590909090909091	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.0227272727272727	0.0555555555555555	2.8295488007595484	2.826317539259576	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

1.0	1.0	I feel that we are prioritizing efforts of saving the planet in the wrong way. We want to ban this or that, and that's great and all. However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	541	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

4.0	3.875	Reading about issues happening across the world seems foreign, but just think: any trouble anywhere in the world, the US is usually involved. I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	sadness	2.0	5.0	2.0	41.0	60000.0	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	81	44	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0833333333333333	2.51888015678584	2.499289970764298	An essay written by a 41.0 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

6.0	5.5	This story about the shooting at the airport is absolutely breaking my heart.  There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	90000.0	7.0	3.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.0	2.571	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	140	65	0.1333333333333333	0.1555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2	0.0444444444444444	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.0	2.834552705522152	2.8971712736664346	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 90000.0$.
