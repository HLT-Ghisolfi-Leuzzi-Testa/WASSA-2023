The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	89	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.854831722181132	2.85783810994379	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher.

The mere thought of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sorrow. Imagining them wandering aimlessly, without a coat, feeling cold and terrified, is truly heartbreaking. I feel an immense sense of gratitude towards the officers who found her before any unfortunate incidents occurred. My sincerest wish is for her to be swiftly reunited with her family, and for effective preventive measures to be established, ensuring that such incidents never happen again. Perhaps, given the circumstances, the family might consider seeking additional support, such as a group home, to provide the necessary care and assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	144	2246	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.2558139534883721	0.1860465116279069	0.1395348837209302	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0714285714285714	3.054081726553815	2.873029219740168	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	6.0	There were numerous aspects of this article that deeply troubled me. I cannot fathom experiencing what this girl went through because I would never expect my parents to subject me to such circumstances. It's astonishing that they have been released from jail, as they appear to pose a significant threat to society by perpetrating such acts against their own child. It is my fervent hope that these individuals never come into contact with another innocent child. As parents, our primary duty is to safeguard our children, and this girl can never reclaim her lost childhood. It is difficult to comprehend how she could ever trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such trauma. Her mental state must be profoundly affected, and I genuinely wish for her to receive the necessary support.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	133	2254	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0384615384615384	3.1123587064547973	3.09501349531376	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I find this article deeply concerning. Despite the numerous movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that fewer women are pursuing careers or reaching senior positions because our society often stigmatizes hardworking women who choose not to have children. Moreover, it is evident that we still live in a male-dominated world, with women, on average, earning only half of what men earn, creating little incentive for upward mobility. By placing greater emphasis on girls' education in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to excel in math, science, and technology—an area where many women currently face challenges. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	131	2242	0.0	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.3636363636363636	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.125	2.7156766262428174	2.664707247296594	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

However, it is disheartening to acknowledge that these attacks have now become distressingly commonplace and are perceived as a regular occurrence. It is high time we prioritize proactive measures to prevent such atrocities and ensure that our focus remains on commemorating the lives lost, rather than granting undue attention to the assailants.	hope	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	81	2252	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1481481481481481	0.2222222222222222	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.0	0.0	3.110964383677904	3.0318268145457363	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I have compassion for both sides in this situation. The police and the local population are both attempting to protect the sacred wildlife and its creatures, while the village likely requires the animal's meat or the funds from its sale, given their extreme poverty. I can imagine the desperation that might arise in a third-world country, where it would seem like the police are depriving them of their sole source of livelihood. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely striving to safeguard and do what is morally right. They don't deserve to be subjected to such a violent attack, and I'm surprised they managed to survive such a brutal beating. I hope that more actions are taken to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	124	2241	0.18	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.06	0.2	0.14	0.08	0.04	0.02	0.08	2.9351966297555325	2.836919471871327	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I am deeply troubled by this article. Despite the progress made through various movements, awareness efforts, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading the way in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that the decreasing number of women in the workforce or in senior positions is a result of the societal pressure on women who work hard but choose not to have children. Additionally, the persisting gender pay gap, with women earning an average of 50 percent less than men, creates little motivation to strive for higher positions. By focusing more on girls' education and encouraging their participation in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in mathematics, science, and technology, which are areas where many women currently lack representation. The future instills hope in me that my gender will succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	146	2243	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.28125	0.09375	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.074074074074074	2.7804005154514253	2.7385652984624067	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.0	1.125	I read about this asshole Arcan Cetin who shot up a mall in Oak Harbor, Washington. Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

Nevertheless, it is disconcerting to observe the alarming frequency with which these attacks are transpiring, to the extent that they are gradually becoming normalized. It is incumbent upon us to take concerted action to prevent such attacks and shift our societal focus towards acknowledging the innocent lives lost, rather than providing undue recognition to the perpetrators.	hope	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	89	2253	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.3076923076923077	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.8172279719851665	2.720647485278486	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

On one hand, the police and the community are striving to protect the invaluable wildlife and its inhabitants, while on the other hand, the village likely relies on the animal either for nourishment or to generate income due to their profound poverty. I can comprehend the profound desperation one might experience in a developing country, where it could seem as though law enforcement is severing or appropriating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are simply endeavoring to safeguard and uphold what they perceive to be right. They definitely don't deserve to endure such a brutal attack, and it astounds me that they managed to survive such a savage beating.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Imagining myself in the shoes of the girl described is inconceivable because I could never fathom my own parents inflicting such pain upon me. The fact that her parents are now out of jail is incredibly disturbing, as their actions present a significant danger to society, particularly considering they perpetrated these acts against their own child. I fervently hope that these individuals never encounter another vulnerable child. As parents, our foremost responsibility is to protect our children, and this girl can never reclaim the innocence of her childhood. It is unimaginable how one could trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such horrific experiences. Her mental well-being must be profoundly impacted, and I earnestly wish for her to receive the necessary support and guidance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	134	2256	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.1162790697674418	0.0697674418604651	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.1162790697674418	0.0454545454545454	2.9823536598803804	3.008944842818962	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	6.0	My sympathies extend to both sides in this situation. The authorities and the local population are both driven by different motives: safeguarding the invaluable wildlife and its habitats, versus the villagers' potential reliance on the animal for sustenance or income due to their impoverished circumstances. I can envision the extreme desperation one might feel in a developing nation, where it could appear that law enforcement is depriving or confiscating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely attempting to safeguard and uphold what they believe to be just. They certainly don't deserve to endure such a vicious assault, and it astonishes me that they managed to survive such a merciless thrashing. I sincerely hope that greater efforts are made to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	130	2239	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	0.1904761904761904	0.0238095238095238	0.2619047619047619	0.1666666666666666	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0666666666666666	2.852581034531611	2.6664287201571537	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

It is my earnest desire for individuals to respect the need for polar bears and other animals to live undisturbed, parallel to the way humans live their lives. I hold out hope that, in due course, the polar bear population will recover and return to a state considered normal.	hope	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	76	2250	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1052631578947368	3.0542650388119568	2.770011443445994	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.

Despite the multitude of movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women in America, it is disheartening that we have not yet achieved the top spot in all aspects of gender equality. In my opinion, one of the reasons why fewer women are working or reaching senior positions is the societal judgment faced by hardworking women who prioritize their careers over having children. Furthermore, the fact that women, on average, earn only 50 percent of what men do indicates that we still live in a predominantly male-oriented world, providing little motivation to strive for higher positions. However, I believe that by placing a stronger focus on girls' education and promoting their involvement in STEM subjects, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in fields like math, science, and technology, where women's participation is currently lacking. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	160	2244	0.0	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.3529411764705882	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.1470588235294117	0.1071428571428571	2.756987282125528	2.681454298686307	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I strongly believe that older individuals should receive proper protection and vigilant monitoring, as situations like these are distressingly common.

I find it impossible to empathize with the girl in question because I could never envision my parents subjecting me to such a situation. The fact that her parents have been released from jail is truly unsettling, as their actions indicate a clear threat to society, especially considering they committed these acts against their own child. It is my sincere hope that these individuals never cross paths with another innocent child. Protecting one's children is an inherent responsibility, and it is disheartening to acknowledge that this girl can never regain her stolen childhood. The aftermath of such an ordeal would undoubtedly shatter one's trust in others and make living a normal life a formidable challenge.

I hold hope for a future where the polar bear population will be restored to its former numbers.	hope	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	73	2248	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.0588235294117647	0.4705882352941176	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.05	3.154471348968768	2.897808246438206	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

Children passing out in the streets simply because they have no food to eat is heartbreaking. No one should have to suffer simply because they can't afford food. There needs to be another option.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	75000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	6.5	6.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	3.571	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	14	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.4	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.0	2.8384798246330862	2.8852451856284387	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

6.0	5.5	This story about the shooting at the airport is absolutely breaking my heart.  There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	90000.0	7.0	3.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.0	2.571	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	140	65	0.1333333333333333	0.1555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2	0.0444444444444444	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.0	2.834552705522152	2.8971712736664346	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 90000.0$.

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	19	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.745087308750816	2.573490038513232	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This type of article deeply resonates with me. It underscores the urgent need to protect and closely monitor older individuals, as these incidents occur far too frequently. Numerous seniors suffer from dementia, rendering them unaware of their surroundings and highly prone to becoming lost. Contemplating the possibility of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sadness. The image of them wandering, without a coat, feeling cold and frightened, is absolutely heart-wrenching. I am immensely grateful that the officers located her before any harm befell her. My hope is that she can be promptly reunited with her family, and that comprehensive safeguards are implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring. It may be beneficial for the family to consider additional support options, such as a group home, to ensure her well-being and provide the necessary assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	140	2247	0.1333333333333333	0.0222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.1777777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0222222222222222	0.0444444444444444	0.0769230769230769	2.963389717656195	2.8083628941152767	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.
