I can see how you would be too scared to go to a doctor sometimes and think you can handle things at home. But this was something serious!!! He was scared it was broken so I don't know why he would put a steel chopstick in there???? Was it supposed to fix it? This guy must have been seriously scared to try to check things out at home. He must have been terrified. I feel so bad. He must have been so upset to realize he couldn't get it out, and knowing now he had to go to the doctor. Thank god he didn't push it in any further or they said he could have died! Poor guy. At least he stopped before that point. He must be on his own because his wife would have nagged	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	40.0	80000.0	6.5	6.0	4.0	5.0	2.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	166	1551	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.5657416743264174	2.7223160282267576	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

Cows produce a lot of methane from their backsides that eats away at the ozone and makes it dangerous down here on the earth surface. People feel its imporant that more people become vegetarian because it would limit the amount of cows and the level of methane in the air.	fear	1.0	5.0	2.0	30.0	75000.0	7.0	5.0	4.5	6.0	6.0	2.714	2.143	2.571	2.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	1431	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.837065531403772	2.739982484287939	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I am a cat owner and they are always ""skitished"" and afraid so my first thought is how terrified they must have been and then how awful the children must feel.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

So if this was in America I would not support it, but I don't feel right condemning the actions of an entirely different country for doing what they felt needed to be done.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	16	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.5752982542087293	2.4785911464183514	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.This equally large amount of  aquatic.	fear	1.0	4.0	3.0	32.0	50000.0	3.5	3.5	5.0	3.5	3.5	3.143	3.143	3.286	2.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	1035	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.0	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.0	0.0	2.8811144346996973	2.706010688031269	An essay written by a 32.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

It's every parent's worst nightmare.  I don't know what would be worse, having hope that the kids are still alive or never having closure.  And how scared the kids must have been!

I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	1337	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

I hope the people taken to the hospital are okay.	fear	1.0	2.0	1.0	45.0	31000.0	6.5	1.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	1.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	83	1344	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0652173913043478	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.0625	2.420799717443751	2.309580074622468	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 31000.0$.

6.0	1.5	The medical profession is clueless according to three articles I just read. They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

Without the wilderness, the animals will have nowhere to live, and without the wilderness, what will our animals be forced to live in.

I just read an article about squirrels attacking a retirement home and injuring three elderly. It must have been so terrifying for them to encounter this event. Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases. I feel troubled thinking about this because these elderly can't really react quick enough in these situations.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	1024	0.1860465116279069	0.1162790697674418	0.0465116279069767	0.0232558139534883	0.0465116279069767	0.1162790697674418	0.2093023255813953	0.1162790697674418	0.0930232558139534	0.0465116279069767	0.0	3.0442484540163	3.051787245699867	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

I feel so bad for the family of the man who was killed. I guess his son plays for the Chiefs. I hope they will figure out why it happened what this guy had against the man he shot. Terrible and I thought airports had better security than to let a man with a gun get there and be able to kill someone. It's so crazy nowadays that you aren't safe anywhere. I hope this won't start more aint gun talk. We both know its not the gun but the person doing the shooting. I wish we could concentrate more on mental health and not so much omg it was the gun.

I wish people would donate more and that restaurants could donate their unused food to homeless shelters.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	15	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.0	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.0	3.0611905715665784	2.9260388707459817	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

Alot suffer from dimentia and have no idea what is going on and can get lost very easily. It makes me think if this was my parent or grandparent I would be heartbroken. She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her. I hope she is able to be reunited with her family quickly and they put safeguards in place so it never happends again.

Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	36	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.901869276182453	2.975700762759283	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

According to this article that I read online, a police officer was shot to death and another police officer was injured in an ambush. I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	24.0	55000.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	829	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1458333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.91722408565792	2.8410753633042187	An essay written by a 24.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

7.0	6.25	I am crushed after hearing about the conditions in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew hit the area.   The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.   I think that our country should continue to report on these terrible conditions and try to get aid to Haiti from every source available.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	68000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	710	0.1538461538461538	0.0961538461538461	0.0576923076923076	0.0576923076923076	0.0384615384615384	0.173076923076923	0.2115384615384615	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0192307692307692	0.0	3.056562693868852	2.88894752613392	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 68000.0$.

He was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal government which would have angered the Russian government so I bet they killed him off so that they could avoid him giving away information to the federal government.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	100000.0	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	103	1273	0.2580645161290322	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.04	2.660010450956814	2.6312349582327843	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

Morocco could see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north, displacing forests. Deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains. Average temperatures in the region have already risen by 1.3°C since the late 19th century, well above the world average of 0.85°C, according to the study.""

The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

Well apparently it will not be ending any time soon.  It is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it.  There are organizations out there that is trying to prevent this and fight against childhood obesity.  The WHO organization is blaming video bloggers/vloggers who get paychecks from junk food companies.  They are claiming that they are more powerful than ads.

It was not like super tragic but it just makes me think about my own life. It also makes me really think about my living situation. I have never thought about how I live in an apartment building shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences. For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control. It really freaks me out now that I know someone besides just myself could ruin my home or personal belongings. Even worse, someone could lose their life.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	50000.0	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	796	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.744424323629415	2.6927003226889843	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

It is heartbreaking to see people fight for land they love it, and it’s heartbreaking for the police to have to shoot people over it. people lose years of their lives in prison over land and cattle and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted in court cases. the whole article was a mess!	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	30000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.143	3.857	4.571000000000001	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	1293	0.1764705882352941	0.1568627450980392	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0196078431372549	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.0784313725490196	0.0588235294117647	0.0392156862745098	0.0	3.121228650029198	2.9456770444719145	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 30000.0$.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.

""I just want to ask the security personnel who fired pellets at me what my fault was,"" Miss Mushtaq says, as she stands by the same window she was sitting at when pellets blinded her. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision. Nothing has worked so far, but she remains hopeful. Ms Mushtaq says she wanted to become a doctor before losing her vision. She brings out her text books to show me, and flips the pages though she cannot read them anymore.

2.167	6.875	So, I just read this article about a series of bombing in New York and New Jersey and how these acts are being viewed as an act of terrorism. Sometimes I still cannot believe that we lived through 9/11, especially because before that I had never even heard the word terrorism or knew what a terrorist attack was. And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people. The fact that we cannot live a carefree life anymore because of the sick minds of individuals scares me daily and makes me wish I could keep my kids in a bubble!!!	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	7.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	4.0	2.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	151	858	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0208333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2291666666666666	0.125	0.1041666666666666	0.0208333333333333	0.0	2.818349889020395	2.9474151269683917	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

6.0	6.0	Awful news article. Us as a society need to do a better job of protecting and helping not only our planet, but the animals and mammals that surround it. The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	89	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.854831722181132	2.85783810994379	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	83	77	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.0	2.7184653168122166	2.651762222039036	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

I can see how scary it would be sitting inside your home watching television and your whole house starts to shake. I hope that this does not effect the oil fields and people jobs in the area in the long run.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	1558	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.1428571428571428	2.619210683461729	2.3730315291896704	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

4.333	3.75	Global warming is real. The effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us. The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	36.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	162	881	0.1578947368421052	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0263157894736842	0.0303030303030303	3.074889281869577	2.774841346826427	An essay written by a 36.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	1400	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.

She sympathized with me without making me feel like a small child who needed my parents to win my battles for me. She would say ""That's awful, honey.

All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed.

I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

3.833	1.375	So the police found this woman wondering the streets in Philadelphia at 1 am with no coat on in the cold. She was in some kind of daze, probably alzheimer's or something. Anyways, their trying to identify her. It would suck to be in that state of mind. Sounds horrible and potentially scary if your cognizant enough.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	38.0	17000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	57	823	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	2.6811900376559388	2.7088542148953025	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 17000.0$.

1.5	4.375	Just read that due to climate change, hotter than normal temps may be the new normal. In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop. I do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to save themselves, and this is the biggest tragedy of all.	fear	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	918	0.25	0.0	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.0666666666666666	2.726847471609561	2.818324191358616	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

6.5	6.25	I'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this. At first I was perturbed at the first article because I felt like the lady was being ridiculous. She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	19	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.745087308750816	2.573490038513232	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.
