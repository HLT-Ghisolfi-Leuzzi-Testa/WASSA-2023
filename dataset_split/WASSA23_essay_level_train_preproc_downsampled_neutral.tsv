2.5	5.125	Second hand smoke is a bad things and I'm glad it is banned from around children.  I do not want the government to have the power to tell people what to do with their bodies. I do not like smoking, but I think that every adult should have the right to do whatever they want with their body. I think smoking should only be banned if it harms other people.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	70	1979	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.125	2.6355314553854114	2.6151847085797937	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

3.0	1.75	It must be terrifying to be in a trail derailment like that.  Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.  Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	121	1919	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.546873917097362	2.515941125349095	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again.

6.0	5.625	Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

Drescher also said that the majority of research surrounding conversion therapy has taken place on adults who’ve undergone the process, and there is very little research surrounding LGBTQ youth who have been through conversation therapy practices. “But of course you have anecdotal stories,” he said. “Some children have reported running away from home, there have been cases in the news of young people of when their family found out about them or they came out and the family insisted they go to conversion therapy	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	160000.0	4.5	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	3.429	3.429	2.714	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	265	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	3.164152056425312	2.953442137812333	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 160000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.0	5.0	This article is very interesting to me. I think alot of consumers have a lack of education when it comes to food, food safety, labeling, and disposal. If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	1978	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

I feel that kids should receive these vaccinations as they are a easy way to help and protect people all over the world rather than taking a risk.	neutral	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	101	825	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.15	0.0	0.3	0.1	0.05	0.0	0.1	0.0555555555555555	3.0545820704711746	2.8569599597170594	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

Whats interesting about this is the environment and the species in these ecosystems are going through morphological changes. Sometimes we get this idea that climate change will eradicate all life from the Earth but it seems that we will be able to adapt to it to a certain extent. By no means am I say we shouldn't make changes to solve climate change but it is interesting to seem how life is adapting to the changes.	neutral	1.0	6.0	6.0	27.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	2.5	4.571000000000001	3.571	3.571	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	91	1086	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8774915542186603	2.7565353454400663	An essay written by a 27.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

7.0	7.0	The general rule of thumb is that to be healthy individuals need to get a minimum of eight hours of sleep a night. Some people get more, and some people get along well with less, but everyone needs to get enough sleep or else they cannot function effectively in their everyday activities. In their work, Your Guide to a Healthy Sleep, National Institutes of Health pointed out that sleep is very important to human existence, so important that one-third of a person’s life is spent doing it (1).

Climate change can affect the habitats of wild animals and cause them to die from things like lack of water, which is still a big deal.

Ranaviruses can infect amphibians, reptiles and fish. In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations. This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	55000.0	5.0	3.5	3.5	3.0	4.0	3.429	3.429	3.143	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	69	738	0.1875	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0625	0.25	0.1875	0.1875	0.0	0.0	2.9137728984765427	2.770498984490428	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

2.333333333333333	1.0	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	122	1898	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.1935483870967742	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.0555555555555555	2.305731052841248	2.071920123071438	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

In fact, some of the wildfires in neighboring southern states can produce enough smoke to cover areas of South Carolina. Despite not actually having a fire there, the smoke can get so thick that it takes heavy rain to make it dissipate.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	30.0	79000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.0	4.571000000000001	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	64	1063	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.6666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8480668188189626	2.644468507455667	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 79000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	119	1983	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so.

The vast majority of these people just want to live and build something for themselves.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate their works cited to the various other work they are completing in ways to document not only their feelings on the article, but also progress on their goals as a person regarding their personalized information they receive.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

7.0	1.5	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents. I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

It they can become more self-less, and less selfish, they will make decisions that are in the best interest and safety of the people of Yemen, aside and apart of whatever their political idealogies may be, when they are saving lives, and not just garnering votes, or political power	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	139	939	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.05	3.054537124601838	2.8769135735068083	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	37500.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	125	1171	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1351351351351351	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6932243424568827	2.65952896669124	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 37500.0$.

I think other zoos throughout the world should step up and try to rescue the animals, or at the very least, preserve them for a scientific purpose and euthanize them humanely. Those that are endangered should be removed. It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	34999.0	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	82	1994	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0833333333333333	2.7043999710322	2.709126651369151	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 34999.0$.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

It seems dishonorable.	sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	55	0.2045454545454545	0.1136363636363636	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.1	2.8232895502322544	2.7214361762141253	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

4.0	4.0	France Dismantles 'The Jungle' in Calais — A small camp in Calais, France, housing nearly 8,000 migrants hoping to cross into England, is being evacuated and torn down in what French authorities are calling a “humanitarian” operation. The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp. The dismantlement operation is expected to last for a week.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	100.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	2.857	3.571	3.714	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	98	1113	0.15	0.05	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.25	0.1	0.0	0.05	0.0	2.706341691957868	2.615109213832003	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100.0$.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

Impressive muscle control allows skunks to target their enemy's face at a distance of over 2m.Without this deterrent, the slow-moving skunks would be unable to escape from predators.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	94	208	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.3684210526315789	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.0	2.793035024388823	2.759541580021512	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

Now, every person and company is its own media brand - and there are significantly less barriers to reaching people.his has allowed smaller brands to gain a foothold in the market much easier. When we see trends like craft beer, food trucks, and local fashion, that is often the result of harnessing social media platforms to build a following in a cost effective way.  Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street.

4.5	2.0	This article was quite interesting to me. It talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive. It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.

The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke. I hope the child is not permanently scarred from this incident.	neutral	2.0	2.0	1.0	60.0	74000.0	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	123	1295	0.0222222222222222	0.0222222222222222	0.1777777777777777	0.1555555555555555	0.0666666666666666	0.1777777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0	0.1777777777777777	0.0833333333333333	2.6428405006901152	2.67549175192833	An essay written by a 60.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000.0$.

4.0	1.5	There are a lot of older people in Russia who survived the Second World War who are now trying their best to survive.  Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.  I hope the Russian economy becomes better enough to support  it's elderly and everyone else in the country.	neutral	1.0	2.0	3.0	36.0	150000.0	6.5	5.5	4.5	7.0	6.5	4.714	2.0	2.857	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	111	1234	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.2258064516129032	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.1290322580645161	0.0625	2.6801603011144954	2.532199303021572	An essay written by a 36.0 years old black or african american male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 150000.0$.

First I would say Issa never receded his support for Trump after the Infamous Hollywood Access recording.  For somebody who preach's morals its kind of hypocritical.  Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests. He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection.

I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	2017	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0434782608695652	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.

6.0	4.625	"What a mess immigration across the globe has become. It is such a delicate subject. Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all. In fact, Germany is in rapid negotiations with Afghanistan and other countries to repatriate those who have fled.

Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

He was a special wolf from a pack in California that was endangered and had a tracking device on him so they could monitor his movements. he had already traveled 700 miles looking for a mate, which is what wolves do when they come of age. They are trying to hold them accountable for the needless and cruel slaughter of wild animals. I forgot the name of the group. But I hope they stop them.

Kenyan authorities have reacted super angrily to a U.N. decision this week to dismiss the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force there, for failing to protect civilians during a recent outbreak of violence.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	3.0	4.571000000000001	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	62	1323	0.1578947368421052	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.1578947368421052	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.577787548367376	2.6979898698358404	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 30000.0$.

Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?

The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.
