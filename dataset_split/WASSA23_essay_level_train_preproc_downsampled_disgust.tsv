The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country. I can see being so desperate in a third world country that this would seem like the police are cutting off or taking your only source of livlihood. These poor guys however they are just trying to protect and do what is right they do not deserve to be so violently attacked im suprised they were able to live through such a brutal beating.

Maybe you didn't even interact with them and they just decided to kill you for fun. It's deeply troubling and makes you suspicious of every stranger on the street. I also feel bad for those who had to witness this and didn't have time to do anything to stop it.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	215	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0256410256410256	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.0416666666666666	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

How awful that people choose to do this to each other and how awful that some poor kid had to be a witness to it all. That child will never be the same again. I wonder why people who choose to do something like this can't just kill themselves and leave everyone around them alone.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

But it's a poor black neighbourhood, so of course they aren't as careful.	disgust	2.0	6.0	5.0	28.0	65000.0	6.0	7.0	3.0	3.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.714	3.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	100	709	0.0	0.09375	0.09375	0.09375	0.09375	0.21875	0.15625	0.09375	0.0625	0.09375	0.0588235294117647	3.032693689729871	2.941020935965556	An essay written by a 28.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

We continue to damage the environment and this tug boat company just says oh my apologies and thanks for cleaning up my mess. After they destroyed ecological habitats and caused damage to almost extinct species. The company should be fined millions of dollars and be in some serious deep water no pun intended. I know you agree man. I hate to see animals hurt and just the negligence is enough to make me want to go out there myself.

1.167	1.625	I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans. We deserve to burn....	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	540	0.1363636363636363	0.1590909090909091	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.0	0.1136363636363636	0.2045454545454545	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0416666666666666	2.697295270881341	2.8091428966324834	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF. The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place. I'm tired of constantly hearing about people getting away with white collar crimes.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	343	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.0	2.60405044555625	2.5656593169863497	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	2110	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article is just horrifying. I understand that the police officers deal with hard to arrest people but punching someone yet alone a woman and mother is just horrible. I think less violent and severe tactics should have been taken in this case. It is there discretion but I think he was just taking his anger out on this lady and in no way should that be allowed. In front of her children and family. Maybe she was just worried the arrest was not suppose to happen, you should not be able to become violent out of anger.	disgust	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	98	2130	0.1428571428571428	0.1020408163265306	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0816326530612244	0.2244897959183673	0.0816326530612244	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.125	2.755922505876379	2.928137618868038	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Any time you have a person who has authority over another person, eventually things will go bad.  Whether it's kings demanding that they get to deflower any bride before her wedding day (as a law) or our own United States government attempting to strip more and more freedoms from us when we're already slaves... These are the acts of corruption.  These are the acts of cowardice, scum-bag gangsters that wear suits.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	92	238	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.3333333333333333	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.0	2.6267976548718903	2.7109584805912745	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

The problem is that punishments like that end up being applied to people who don't deserve it too. In this particular case, I don't feel bad for the guy at all.

Anyway, evidently she must be popular for some reason, because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand.

3.833	5.875	I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	132	1023	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

But I can understand how he won. Voters were fed up with the traditional lifetime politicians. I think Hillary lost the election more than Trump won it. A lot of people didn't trust her and wanted a change.

Where are the parents when the kids are out there fighting and attacking people in the street. Its just disgusting. I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	97	156	0.1666666666666666	0.1944444444444444	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0666666666666666	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	86	0.1063829787234042	0.1276595744680851	0.0638297872340425	0.1489361702127659	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.1702127659574468	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0909090909090909	2.9422282048245303	3.000730637576451	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

This is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the kitten receives justice, and that the person who did this is not allowed to hurt any more animals. I think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this crime to go unpunished. I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.	disgust	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	826	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0	2.962235586257199	2.972241786915248	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

1.0	6.625	I just read an article about a school volunteer being indicted on child porn charges. I cannot understand what makes these monsters tick. It seems as if every day I am reading about a case of child sex abuse. I think these people should be killed on site. That would change their minds before commiting sex acts on a child. It just keeps getting worse and worse, more and more common. They will be spared in court. They will more than likely get probation and released right back into the community they victimized. It really makes me sick. I went to prison for 5 years for a crime that I didnt even commit, but sex offenders rarely if ever get sent to prison.	disgust	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.714	1.0	1.714	4.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	123	1445	0.1549295774647887	0.0845070422535211	0.1267605633802817	0.0704225352112676	0.0140845070422535	0.1267605633802817	0.1408450704225352	0.1267605633802817	0.056338028169014	0.0985915492957746	0.0	2.719671330098382	2.805733768250068	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

While illegal immigration may have fallen, it's no reason to treat such a big trading partner like a second class world citizen by telling them they have to pay for a wall.

I am sure it is only a matter of time before that also comes out. The more and more I read about him, the more and more disturbed I am to have him as a president and wish I did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Religion makes people do such horrible, hateful, stupid things. Apparently kids just pick up explosives, people get their heads blown off, little girls die for no reason. For what? Because someone's imaginary friend in the sky is slightly different from their imaginary friend in the sky? Ridiculous, disgusting. Imagine what these people could have accomplished if they dedicated themselves to knowledge instead. We could be on other planets, we could live for thousands of years or more.

I think the need for consent is something from the 1400's and should be abolished now.	disgust	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	2100	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.489506585267266	2.4574591979349094	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true.

The MUSLIMS are the problem, not the Taliban."	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	41.0	12500.0	6.0	4.0	3.5	6.0	3.0	2.714	1.857	4.857	3.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	106	278	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.1941460679721567	2.1034057517495044	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 12500.0$.

6.332999999999999	4.5	So I just read an article about climate change, and it is awful. It seems very few people are trying to stop it and it is maddening. We need to take more control over the things that are being put into the air that could be causing such an atrocious thing. We need to start reusing things and switching to organically grown things, if possible. The oceans and lakes are suffering and eventually, we will, too.	disgust	2.0	2.0	1.0	29.0	45000.0	5.5	5.0	4.0	6.5	3.5	3.429	5.0	2.571	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	76	446	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.938107310092154	2.942186289995784	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 45000.0$.

Trump is not against renewable power, he just wants a free market and he is right. The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward. The Paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a boon for the liberals who dream of an elite class ruling the world.	disgust	1.0	5.0	1.0	41.0	68500.0	6.5	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.857	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	359	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.2857142857142857	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0454545454545454	2.831473924846536	2.785350695050864	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 68500.0$.
