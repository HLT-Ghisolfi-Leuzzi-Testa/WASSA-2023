# WASSA-2023

This repository contains the code that our team developed to participate in the WASSA 2023 Shared Task on Empathy Detection, Emotion Classification, and Personality Detection in Interactions.

The notebook [`EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/HLT-Ghisolfi-Leuzzi-Testa/WASSA-2023/blob/main/EDA.ipynb) contains the Exploratory Data Analysis we performed on the WASSA 2023 dataset. The experiments we conducted can be easily replicated running, on Google Colab, the interactive python notebook [`wassa_custom.ipynb`](https://github.com/HLT-Ghisolfi-Leuzzi-Testa/WASSA-2023/blob/main/EDA.ipynb).
