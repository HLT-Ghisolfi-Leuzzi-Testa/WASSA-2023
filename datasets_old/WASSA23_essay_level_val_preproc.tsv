48	210	Reading about the attack on Paris that happened years ago brought up a lot of bad feelings and thoughts. I had completely forgotton about it because of how often things like that happen. It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace	1.0	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	47	Hope/Sadness
308	48	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing	3.5	5.5	38	2	6	1	35	148000	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	1	train	307	Hope/Sadness

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	4.833333333333333	7.0	44	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	2	train	706	Anger

Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory. Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran. Is that what Jews want in a President? They feel safe with that?

I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much. I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean. That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point. We're not the problem.

All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while. I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters. Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats. The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats. Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats? For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.
