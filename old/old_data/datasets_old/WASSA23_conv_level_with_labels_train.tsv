2	0	I feel very sad for the people.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	1	It's terrible. Not only the people but the animals as well!	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	10	I felt really sorry for the sister that now has to rise her siblings.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	11	Yeah, it's going to be tough but i am sure she is strong enough to raise them.	0.6667	3.0	2.0	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	12	Yeah, we never know what we can do unless we are tested.	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	13	True. Have you been in ANY kind of natural disasters?	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	14	Tornado when I was young. They suck too.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	15	Never been in one but i can only imagine it's even scarier than a hurricane	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	16	The power of nature is truly scary.	1.6667	3.3333	1.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	17	Agree. I hope those people get some water and food as soon as possible	1.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	18	Me too, I wish there was a direct way to aid the people.	1.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	19	Yup! Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	2.0	0.3333	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	2	Yeah, the whole situation is horrible.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	20	You too! bye	0.3333	2.0	0.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	3	I really wish there was something i could do.	1.3333	3.6667	3.6667	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	4	I know we can donate, but it's hard to know exactly how the money is used.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	5	I agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane?	1.0	2.0	0.3333	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	6	No, and You?	1.3333	1.0	0.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	7	Yes! It's actually terrifying. We were supposed to evacuate but decided to stay because we thought , what's the worst that can happen?	2.0	4.3333	0.3333	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
2	8	Sorry to hear that, I'm glad that you are okay!	0.3333	3.0	0.3333	1	35.0	30.0	1.0
2	9	Thank you! I'm glad that we still had water and electricity. I can't even imagine what the people over in Haiti are going through	1.0	3.0	3.0	2	35.0	17.0	501.0
3	0	what did you think about the article	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	1	It was such an eye opener about the suffering that happens that you never hear about	1.6667	3.3333	4.0	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	10	what do you think can be done to help the people in haiti	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	11	I think they should do a telethon get a bunch of celebrities and make a hashtag. encourage people to donate and volunteer	0.3333	2.0	3.0	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	12	makes sense. also find better ways rather than trucks that are easily looted by the people	0.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	13	ahh so true!also insure that when you say there is enough for everyone that there actually is.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	14	and also not let the haitian govt get there hands on any of it they are corrupt	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	15	America should dethrone the government and make it the 51st state	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	16	thats a great idea	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	17	hopefully these people get the help they need i am going to look into it after this	0.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	18	me too very interested in the outcome	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	19	so crazy the suffering that is going on that we have no idea about	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	2	its crazy the stuff that goes on in this world	1.3333	4.0	3.3333	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	20	were lucky to live here	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	21	i agree makes my troubles seem so small	0.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	22	yeah makes u realize your problems are miniscule in comparison	0.0	3.0	2.6667	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	23	i agree. it was so nice chatting with you. goodbye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	24	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	3	right i can't believe it. If that was the US they would be set up to avoid fsilure	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	4	yeah some countries are so corrupt though	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	5	true, i heard in puerto rico they did not even distrubute the hurricane supplies the US gave them	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	6	i remember  trump throwing toilet paper rolls at the crowd in puerto rico that was so embarrasing	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	7	o wow that is very embarrassing and degrading	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
3	8	yeah wonder what was going through is head	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	35.0	19.0	2.0
3	9	probably a power trip or an i'm better than you moment	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	2	35.0	16.0	502.0
5	0	Please, what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	1	It's very sad.   I can't believe in the 21st century that people are still so slow in helping third world countries or even in the US when New Orleans was destroyed.   It makes no sense.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	10	It's scary because all you can do is hide in your home hoping it passes by without doing much damage. I hope the people affected by the hurricane are getting help right now.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	11	I follow college basketball like a crazy person.   Skal Labiesse was trapped in the hurricane in this article.   His whole home collapsed on him and he was covered with rock and materials for three days.   His story is so frightening.   He thought he was dying	1.6667	4.3333	3.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	12	Yeah it's definitely very different. The air pressure feels different when you're in a hurricane. All you hear are sounds of things ripping apart ourside	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	13	Wow.   Are you on the gulf or the Atlantic?	1.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	14	Atlantic, i've lived in Florida for about 8 years now and luckyily haven't had any MAJOR hurricane yet.	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	15	That's good to hear.   Haiti has such a corrupt government - I wonder how much their President stole from the people so he had fun for a long time.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	16	I didn't think of that. That's why i don't even donate but i feel bad because i can't help	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	17	It's gotten to that point everywhere unless a church is doing all the work.   American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, United Way - hardly any goes to the people or cause you are donating to - it's all taken in outlandish salaries of that charity	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	18	Sad that people are so corrupt. I really hope those people get help. It was nice talking to you! bye!	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	19	You too goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	2	It's terrible. I feel bad for all the people left without shelter!	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	3	And food - you can get by in Haiti without much shelter but one must have clean water and food to live	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	4	Agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	5	I have not but I have been to Haiti on a mission trip.   Such wonderful kind people.	0.3333	3.3333	3.3333	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	6	Wow, Haiti sounds awesome. I'm from Florida so there's lots of them here and they are all nice.	0.3333	3.0	2.0	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	7	That would be so much stress.   I live in Colorado so just beautiful white snow.	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
5	8	It's pretty stressful when hurricanes hit. I once stayed for one even though we were supposed to evacuate, nobody was hurt but it was a scary experience	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	35.0	17.0	4.0
5	9	I have been near tornadoes and they look bad enough.  I can't imagine a hurricane.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	35.0	8.0	504.0
6	0	what a sad thing to happen to someone who has gone through so much	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	1	and at such a young age too.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	10	yes, I watch the yankees almost every night. How about you?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	11	I like to play baseball, but watching it never really thrills me. Are the Yankees in the playoffs this year?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	12	yes! they made it to the playoffs!	0.0	3.0	0.6667	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	13	that's great! Had you heard about this guy before reading the article? Seems like he was kind of a big deal.	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	14	I heard about it in the news when it happened but I don't follow baseball to close just the yankees. I bet he was a pretty big deal on his team.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	15	do you think it was just a freak accident? Or, was there more to the boat wreck than was indicated?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	16	I remember hearing he jumped into the water head first into a rock and it killed him instantly.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	17	huh, the article made it sound like it was a wreck at high speed or something. The rock story seems less conspicuous.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	18	i couldn't imagine being the family of him that had to be horrible	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	19	no doubt. well thanks for chatting with me. Go Yankees! bye	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	2	what a freak accident	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	20	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	3	yeah, they didn't really elaborate on what happened though	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	4	he had the true american dream story	0.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	5	more or less, most people can't throw 94 mph fast balls though.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	6	yup but going from poor to crazy rich all from hard work. love to see it	0.0	3.0	2.3333	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	7	seemed to be a pretty altruistic guy too. There wasn't anything but goodwill toward him.	0.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
6	8	I wonder if the team retired his number to honor him	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	213.0	16.0	5.0
6	9	hm, i wouldn't know. Do you follow baseball?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	213.0	25.0	505.0
8	0	Sounded like a very kindhearted man.	0.0	3.0	3.3333	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	1	Yes so sad that his life ended this way	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	10	yeah, so sad that it was cut so short.	1.6667	3.3333	4.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	11	very sad. from the reading material he sounded like a great person	1.3333	3.0	4.0	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	12	yeah and did not change much when he got his baseball money.	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	13	yes it sounds like he stayed true to himself	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	14	He must had a lot of trust for the driver of the boat.	0.3333	2.0	3.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	15	I dont know how the driver managed to hit the rocks at full speed. Youd have to see something like that coming	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	16	That what I was thinking. It is not a pretty way to die.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	17	No not at all. A real tragedy for sure	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	18	He was a very good player too.	0.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	19	One of the best.	0.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	2	I was wondering if no drugs or alcohol were involved what happened?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	20	It was nice chatting! bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	21	You too, goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	3	Maybe an inexperienced person trying to drive the boat?	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	4	That could have been it.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	5	Boating can be quite dangerous if you dont know what you are doing	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	6	It was nice that he saved his mom not knowing it was her.	0.0	2.6667	3.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	7	Yes very nice.  It sounds like they had a hard life in cuba	0.3333	3.0	3.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
8	8	Yeah, It was nice for the team to get the visa.	0.0	2.6667	3.0	1	213.0	30.0	7.0
8	9	Im sure his life was quite different after beginning his baseball career	0.0	2.0	3.3333	2	213.0	43.0	507.0
10	0	Sad about what happened to those guys.  I hope no one makes this about alcohol or anything.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	1	Yes after all the struggle to get to where he was	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	10	I feel like there's lots of stories out there about people saying they saw everything but from the third person perspective or things like that. Other people say it was just the deepest sleep they've ever had.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	11	the mind is a trip	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	12	For real.  Obviously they don't know everything about it, but it blows my mind when I watch docs or something where people are breaking down the parts of the brain... Like, how the fuck did we figure all this stuff out...	0.6667	3.3333	1.0	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	13	yea I love watching that stuff I'm the only one who's not a doctor in my family but I'm still in the medical field we used to have some real interesting dinner convos	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	14	What do you do in the medical field?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	15	Surgical Technologist	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	16	Damn.  Sounds cool.  Do you just sit in on surgeries and assist?	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	17	Yea my job is to get all the instruments ready and basically be an extra pair of hands for the surgeon handing him all the instruments and helping him with the surgery. A good surgical tech knows the surgery just as well as the surgeon so he/she never has to ask for anything you should anticipate it	0.6667	2.3333	0.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	18	Yeah I here ya, probably makes the operation flow a lot smoother when the surgeon asks for a tool and you're not fumblefuckin around looking to find the blahblahmeter.	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	19	yea they get super pissed if you waste time each minute counts	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	2	Right. I can't imagine being his family either.  To see their child go like that after being so successful has to sting.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	20	what's the longest surgery you;ve ever taken part in?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	21	8 hour spinal surgery	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	22	Yikes.  Well if Jose would've survived he probaby would have needed at least an 8 hour spinal surgery.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	23	yes for sure it was nice talking to you goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	24	bye.	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	3	absolutely growing up in Cuba and then achieving so much	1.6667	2.0	3.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	4	I don't remember if it said so in the article or not, but was it night when they ran into the rocks? I just don't get why they didn't see them?	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	5	I remember when this happened saw it on ESPN but I think it was night	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	6	At least it was probably instant.  They probably had no idea the rocks were there and absolutely flew into them without any chance to realize what was going on.	1.3333	2.3333	3.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	7	yea it would suck to be in a coma	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
10	8	Lol I think it would suck more to come out of a coma.  When you're in it you have no idea.  I would hate coming out of one and realizing you lost a month of your life or something.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	213.0	49.0	9.0
10	9	I wonder what you think about in a coma	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	213.0	33.0	509.0
11	0	Hello what did you think about the articlee?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	1	I thought it shows how people can really change	0.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	10	Maybe my cousin is just a sociopath. I hope those kids that got out find good jobs in the future.	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	11	yea its hard because people are scared to hire people who were in the system even if they change	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	12	I think that if i owned a business, i would definitely think twice about a person who served time	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	13	yea me too	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	14	How would you feel about someone in your family marrying a person that went to jail before?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	15	it would depend on the crime I guess	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	16	What if it's minor like stealing, but has done it many times.	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	17	I don't know about multiple offenses maybe if it was a max of 2 times	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	18	Very interesting! Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.6667	2.6667	0.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	19	you too bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	2	Definitely. I felt so bad for the children at first.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	3	yes they get caught up in the system	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	4	They should be in school and making friends!	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	5	I know well who knows how safe school is now a days	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	6	I had a cousin who went to jail at a young age, he never really changed.	2.0	2.0	0.6667	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	7	some people get caught up in that life i have friends that will always be in jail	2.0	2.6667	1.0	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
11	8	I definitely believe that people can't really change. what about you?	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	78.0	17.0	10.0
11	9	I think most people can but some are real sociopaths	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	78.0	33.0	510.0
13	0	What did you think of this?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	1	this was so sad i never really thought of kids in foster care and how hard it was	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	10	yeah, to turn something good from something bad and now hes helping others	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	11	Agreed, I hope eventually the system is fixed and structured better	0.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	12	yes it needs help, but i think there is a lack of good foster parents	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	13	yeah i know alot just do it for tax and write offs and are horrible caretakers to the kids	1.3333	3.6667	2.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	14	yeah exactly!!!  And then the kids are mistreated, so saf	1.3333	3.6667	4.0	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	15	I dont know how they do it so resiliant	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	16	Yeah the human soul has remarkable resilience	0.0	3.0	3.6667	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	17	true it is amazing to read about	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	18	Yes, and this was a pretty amazing, sad story with a good ending.  well I must go, have a good day.  goodbye	0.0	2.6667	3.0	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	19	great goodbye!	0.0	1.0	0.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	2	It is sad for them, no child should have to endure all that	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	3	agreed and not there fault they had behavioral issues	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	4	well, yes and no.  we all have personal responsibility for our choices in my opinion.  regardless of circumstance	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	5	They needed more direction and structure they didnt get in the system	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	6	yes they definitely did, it failed them	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	7	it is nice he changed his life around and is helping others now	0.0	3.3333	3.0	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
13	8	yes that was the best part of the article	0.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	78.0	24.0	12.0
13	9	Yeah I did not expect that honestly	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	78.0	53.0	512.0
14	0	What a story!	1.0	3.0	1.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	1	yeah, lots of ups and downs in that one	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	10	Absolutely. And also some sort of self sufficiency classes for those who are about to age out of the system	0.0	3.0	2.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	11	I think we could all benefit from self sufficiency/life skills classes as teenagers.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	12	My school had them every week and I loved it. Learned a lot of life skills	0.0	2.6667	1.0	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	13	What kind of skills did you learn?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	14	Sewing, vehicle maintenance, budgeting, childcare, basic home repairs, tax basics, etc.	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	15	interesting, I don't think my high school offered classes like that. We had home economics, but that was primarily cooking and cleaning.	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	16	I think all schools should offer classes like that. Theyre very beneficial	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	17	Agreed. What did you think of the sibling that eventually got his masters and now helps kids in similar situations?	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	18	I think its amazing how he turned his life around. A true inspiration	0.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	19	It's crazy how differently people react to similar circumstances. Thanks for chatting with me today. bye	0.0	2.0	2.3333	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	2	It sounds like the system failed him at an early age	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	20	Great talking to you. Goodbye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	3	unfortunately, i think stories like this are all too common with children who go through the foster system.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	4	For sure. Many fall  through the cracks and its so sad.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	5	it's really crazy that those two brothers ended up in the same prison	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	6	I know! What are the odds?	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	7	astronomical. Do you have any thoughts on how the foster system could be improved?	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
14	8	I'd say have more oversight of individual cases. So many children arent getting the attention on their cases that they need. Do you have any suggestions?	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	78.0	43.0	13.0
14	9	I agree, I also think that counseling services should be provided by the state	0.0	2.6667	3.0	2	78.0	25.0	513.0
17	0	Hello. The situation in India is really terrible	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	1	Tell me about it. What a shame that the government of India isn't taking action. It's all about profit to them it seems.	1.3333	3.0	4.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	10	True. It's really pathetic	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	11	There should be some sort of a program that helps these elephants get transported to a place where their homes won't be destroyed. Do you know of any charities that could help?	0.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	12	Nope. I doubt if the government will allow that.	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	13	You really don't think they would allow international help? I will pose the question... What would you do if this were happening in your hometown?	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	14	The government in India is corrupt. They are involved in the illegal trade of ivory. They won't allow any external body to interfere with their business	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	15	You make a really good point. I wasn't thinking about that.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	16	I've read series of disturbing stories about their activities in the illegal trade of ivory	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	17	I've actually heard about that a while ago. Like I stated earlier... They care about profits over people.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	18	Yeah. It's all about the rupees	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	19	I'm afraid that they will hurt these communities to the point where they create a refugee crisis.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	2	Apparently. The most worrisome part of the situation is the fact that they barely compensate the victims	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	20	That's the reality.	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	21	At the very least I wonder if we could donate things like breathing masks? Maybe that could help some to breath a bit better. Or if there is a way to get them clean water delivered.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	22	"That won't be a bad idea. How do ""we"" go about that"	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	23	I would imagine that we could set up a GoFundMe campaign. That's definitely one way to go about it.	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	24	There have been several scam cases with GFM	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	25	There are alternative platforms. I would be happy to research them in detail. Charities can be looked into as well.	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	26	That'll be great	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	27	It's the least we can do, and like I said, posting on social media would help raise awareness. I just wish we could wave a wand and these communities would have clean air and water.	0.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	28	goodbye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	29	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	3	It's such a shame and a human rights abuse. Every living creature for that matter has a basic right to clean air and water. I couldn't imagine how bad it must be living near one of those mines.	1.6667	3.3333	4.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	4	Indeed. What do you think can be done on the part of the citizens in order to draw attention of the international communities?	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	5	Any change with government happens when people join together en mass. They need to be protesting outside of every politicians office. They should also spread this story to the international community to publicly shame their officials. Do you have any ideas of what can be done?	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	6	In all honesty, I have no idea.	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	7	I can think of how in the US change was created with the civil rights movement, and the women's movement when people stood together. I think that because people like us know about the story we can help by sharing this information on social media. We can be the media for them. But what can be done about the poor elephants? They have lost their homes because of the forest's being destroyed.	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
17	8	It's left for their government to decide	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	336.0	31.0	16.0
17	9	Ultimately yes. So it's up to everyone to make sure their government works in their best interest. Some people not even receiving compensation was terrible, but what about the kids who lost their lives? No amount of money can replace life.	1.3333	3.6667	3.3333	2	336.0	18.0	516.0
18	0	The effect is terrible	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	1	it is only one of many issues affecting the poorer population, but yea	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	10	That is what they do. They give false hopes	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	11	the effort to change at the population level needs to be massive	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	12	People should be more orientated.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	13	there is still some hope. i recall reading a different article, also from India, dealing with a big volunteer effort toward reforestation	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	14	Oh, that is great. Reforestation is a great way...I hope people follow it through	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	15	it was. it took them 15 years, but the new forest is thriving. the issue is the population need to be more conscientious and understand that the benefits might not be seen overnight.	0.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	16	Yea, that is some nice method.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	17	i'm kind of running out of things to say, and we need at least 15 messages each that are relevant to the articles	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	18	yes...I think finding alternatives to coal is also a great idea	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	19	wind and solar are the first that come to mind	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	2	I think humans are generally selfish	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	20	And nuclear sources..	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	21	are they capable to handle the necessary infrastructure for that? nobody wants a Chernobyl or Fukushima	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	22	It is good I think.	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	23	they need better overall infrastructure. reaching a lot of these places is hard, if not impossible during some parts of the year	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	24	Yes. can we exchange our byes?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	25	we are short a few still	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	26	good. I have few minutes left here. bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	27	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	3	the article read mostly of financial and political greed. they just don't care	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	4	Yea, It is sad and pathetic.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	5	can't even blame the elephants if everything is getting destroyed. agricultural expansion is one and thing, but coal mining adds a lot more of dangerous stuff to the environment	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	6	Yea, the pollution is massive.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	7	i wonder how far the situation will have to deteriorate for them to be like Oh wait, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
18	8	I dont see that happening sincerely. The are rich, they can afford moving to another planet!	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	336.0	40.0	17.0
18	9	what annoys me too is that the people receive promises after the fact of like an elephant incursion, but it is just that, empty promises	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	336.0	58.0	517.0
19	0	What did you think?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	1	I can not blame them for wanting to industrialize, but it still horrible.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	10	I wouldn't be surprised; many animals have similar lung structures as humans do. It's probably why the elephants etc. have been in so many altercations lately.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	11	Like I said, can't get too mad because American used a lot of coal in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	12	Oh for sure. Many of the appalachian areas, for example, still have serious environmental damages and generational health issues.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	13	Many of the same areas want to continue mining coals. It sucks that we live in a world where economics out weight health.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	14	Yeah. Economics & tradition -- many families have been in the business for so long they can't imagine doing anything else. It's their way of life almost more than it is a living.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	15	I know working in the US mine is a lot safer than the mine in India.	0.0	1.3333	2.6667	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	16	True true. Do you think we should be investing in finding cleaner forms of energy?	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	17	Yes 100 percent.	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	18	We're in agreement then. Something needs to be done soon before we run out of options & time.	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	19	I agree, but a lot people can not think about the future or other people besides themselves	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	2	Yeah. I wish we had better options than coal. It seems like it's wrecking environments everywhere these days.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	20	"""The tyranny of the immediate,"" as one of my professors once said."	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	21	I would like my children's children to be able to have a good life.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	22	Same. Do you have any further thoughts?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	23	No. Very nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	24	bye!	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	3	Yeah, the people and animals over there are suffering.	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	4	For sure. I can't imagine having an elephant burst through my house!	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	5	That would be very scary, then told you will get about 120 dollars for your broken leg.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	6	Probably wouldn't even pay for a single night's stay in a hospital.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	7	It sucks that the people who don't even work in the mines are getting such bad lung diseases.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
19	8	Yeah. It's bad enough when things like this affect people actually involved, but when you have people getting hurt that weren't even part of it it's just so much worse.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	336.0	13.0	18.0
19	9	I wonder if the animals are having lung issues too?	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	336.0	30.0	518.0
21	0	So I thought this was a really tragic and avoidable incident, what did you think	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	1	I was not really bothered, suicides are common	2.0	1.0	2.0	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	10	Sure they could have, but surely there was at least one person who appreciated this woman.  The article stated as much.	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	11	A fair point. When you think about it suicide is the easy way out. It is a bit cowardly. Choosing to continue living requires real courage	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	12	I agree suicide is extremely cowardly and suicide angers me.  It is a terrible choice for people to make and very selfish bc they are not considering how their actions affect others who are left behind.	1.3333	4.0	2.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	13	We can agree on that. Do you know anyone personally who committed suicide?	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	14	Yes, and dealing with the fallout from it and the years and years of aftermath from that person's loved ones was terrible and very straining on everyone around.  The loved ones are STILL not healed and it has been 13 years	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	15	I got that impression from your responses. Do you think the loved ones deserve treatment or should preventative measures be the answer to suicide?	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	16	Can you clarify your question?  I am not sure I fully understand.  Do you mean grief counseling, or what preventative measures are you referring to?  Like should more have been done to try to help the person to start with?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	17	Hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, or even depriving someone of their freedom temporarily to ensure they do not take their life	0.6667	1.0	2.3333	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	18	I think those are reasonable steps to take in some cases but in others it might just make things worse.  I really don't know the answer to that.  If someone is that determined to take their own life it seems they will do it no matter what.  What do you think?  I don't think any of that stuff would have helped int he situation I'm referring to.  But who knows.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	19	What do you think causes suicide? Most animals have such a strong will to live. What causes people to abandon or ignore that innate drive?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	2	common?  I guess.  I don't really see it as an everyday occurence but anyhow	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	20	That's an interesting point about animals.  We don't see them giving up and killing themselves.  Fascinating question, I have no idea what it is about humans.  Maybe it has just become a part of our culture?  Like if the first animal did it then others would follow?  No clues.  What do you think	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	21	I am not sure myself. Most animals also do not have complex social structures and constructs like humans. I am sure that with those stark differences it would be good place to start the investigation.	1.3333	1.0	2.0	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	22	Yes I wonder if it has ever been formally studied	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	23	I was wondering that myself. I think the best animals to study would be primates. I know chimpanzees can suffer from depression but I am not sure whether or not they commit suicide	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	24	OH yeah, really good point.  That would be very interesting to find out.  I guess it would be possible that they could because they do a lot of things that we do.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	25	True, but they also don't do a lot of things we do and I am not sure whether or not suicide is in the Do or Don't category.	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	26	yeah exactly.  It is probably in the don't category.  I guess I could see them like refusing to eat or drink more than bringing a knife to their wrist.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	27	Refusing food and sexual gratification are some of the things chimpanzees do when they are depressed. Similar symptoms in humans. If they were to commit suicide how do you think they would go about doing it?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	28	I would think it would be passive, such as just refusing food and drink until they can't survive.  But maybe the urge to survive would override their depression?  Hard to say.  This has been an interesting conversation and I think we are at 15 messages so I will say goodbye for now and hope you have a great day	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	29	Yes very interesting. I hope you have a good day as well.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	3	No not everyday but people do it and that is their choice	1.6667	1.0	2.0	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	30	goodbye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	31	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	4	Yep, it is definitely their choice.  I still find it sad and very avoidable.  How sad for all their remaining family members.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	5	I see what you mean but don't you think that being sad is just a waste of time?	2.0	1.0	1.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	6	Of course being sad is a waste of time, but it is still appropriate to feel sadness when you hear of a tragedy.  It's not like I'm dressed in black lighting candles and mourning, Jesus Christ.	1.3333	4.0	3.0	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	7	Easy now. I did not mean it as a personal attack. It just doesn't make sense to me to be sad for someone who makes a conscious choice to end their own life. It's their choice	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
21	8	Well then be neutral towards it or happy, that's your right.  I find it sad anytime I hear about a tragedy that happens to others.  I am sad for their family who lost a beloved family member.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	281.0	24.0	20.0
21	9	Let me be clear, I would rather no one commit suicide. How do we know that they were beloved? They could have despised each other	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	281.0	35.0	520.0
22	0	I found the article to be sad.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	1	Me too, depression is a real issue.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	10	Yeah, but I think it is difficult to know what to do when someone you love is going through things that you don't understand.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	11	That is true, but they knew she was having thoughts of killing herself.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	12	Yeah, but maybe they thought that if they hovered too much, she would feel even worse, I don't know.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	13	I guess that is why they have professionals. It is a hard subject.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	14	It is something that people don't know much about especially considering how people ignored or locked away people who went through those things in the past.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	15	I agree, most people see it was weakness and do not understand what is going on.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	16	Yeah and they tend to shame people who seek help.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	17	Or tell them how to deal with it.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	18	Yeah, I don't know why that is. People have no problem seeking help when it comes to physical problems like a broken arm, but when it comes to mental problems forget about it.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	19	I believe it comes down to people not wanting to be seen as weak. I do not think most people think about depression as chemicals in the brain.	1.6667	1.6667	3.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	2	It is and it is so difficult for people to seek help.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	20	I think that is better than it used to be.	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	21	Yes, there is a lot more awareness today.	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	22	Yes, and people are being more understanding about it.	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	23	Going back to what you said earlier. I feel bad for anybody family that has to go though this.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	24	Yeah, it is has so be so hard for them.	2.0	2.6667	4.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	25	It would be the questions about what should you have done.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	26	Yeah, and it probably doesn't stop after somebody kills themselves. They probably still go through that their whole lives, what could they have done differently.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	27	The internet makes it better and worst.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	28	Oh yeah, so many hateful people who don't care who they hurt.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	29	Well, hopeful everybody gets the help they need.	0.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	3	Yeah that is true, I think she wanted help but the system failed her.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	30	I hope so.	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	31	nice chatting with you.	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	32	same to you, goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	33	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	4	Yeah, it did, I feel so bad for her family.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	5	It made me think that money and frame does not matter when it comes to depression	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	6	Considering how many famous people seem to go through that, yeah it doesn't seem to matter.	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	7	I wonder if being famous adds more pressure and makes a person depressed?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
22	8	I guess it could, especially if people have to put up a happy face for the public.	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	281.0	37.0	21.0
22	9	She should have never been left alone.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	281.0	30.0	521.0
24	0	Hello	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	1	How you doing?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	10	I agree. Do you think the doctors that let her go should face any consequences?	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	11	Yeah, he should. They took the oath to protect them	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	12	I think they should do a thorough investigation with the possibility of revoking the doctors license to practice.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	13	Definitely. It will be the best move.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	14	Yeah people deserve to be protected from this happening again.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	15	Exactly. She left all her wealth behind.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	16	It is just really sad.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	17	But what can make rich people fall depressed?	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	18	I dunno. Maybe she was extremely hard on herself.	1.3333	1.6667	3.3333	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	19	Yea, she got disconnected from everything...	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	2	Good, how are you?	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	20	The way she ended it is also pretty crazy.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	21	Its scary..drowning! Jeezzz	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	22	Yeah just walking into the ocean.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	23	I always see suicide as a selfish act though	2.0	3.0	1.0	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	24	Yeah it is wierd for me to think about because I do not know what is going through their minds before they do it. I have never even thought about doing it so it is hard to understand.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	25	I cant. I will always consider my family and friends	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	26	Yeah you have to think about how much damage you will do.	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	27	I always do that	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	28	Well I think we have done enough turns. Was a good little conversation.	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	29	yea..bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	3	Well, Very sad story I must confess	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	30	goodbye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	4	Yeah I have to agree. Stories about suicide are always sad.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	5	It was totally avoidable...the woman called for help	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	6	Yeha. Even more than that she was at the recovery center and they let her go.	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	7	Depression is real. I mean, she is rich and had it all	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
24	8	Yea it really shows that anybody can be affected by depression. It doesn't mather how much money you have.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	1	281.0	20.0	23.0
24	9	That is scary...	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	281.0	40.0	523.0
25	0	Hello what did you think about the article?	0.6667	0.6667	1.0	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	1	It made me very sad.   She had such a hard life.   Whether it's socialized medicine or medicine here in the states, they miss so much with mental illness.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	10	I am the same. I even have trouble going out with close friends sometimes. Just being around people, i don't like..	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	11	"Yeah me too.   I looked at this article and remember this being in the news.   She did all the ""right"" things, physicians didn't share nor did they do anything with the statement of suicide.   That's unacceptable."	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	12	Yeah i still feel bad for the person in the article. Do you think people in society now are more accepting of mental illnesses?	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	13	No - they just look at you with that pitiful look and once employers know they look for ways to terminate you - if you had cancer everyone is supportive.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	14	"That's an interesting way to look at it but i agree. I honestly don't think society will EVER be accepting of people with mental illnesses. They'll always think of us as the ""crazy"" ones."	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	15	And your point is exactly why none of us want to convey we have it.   To your point, we are all crazy.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	16	Well at least we all know deep down we're great people and just slightly different which makes us special.	0.0	3.0	1.6667	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	17	We are - the thing we have to come to agreement on is how do we not feel like we can't do anything all the time.   I don't ever get a break from those feelings.	0.6667	3.0	1.6667	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	18	I get those feelings as well but i think we should tell ourselves that it's okay to have these feelings from time to time. But anyway, that's it for our convo, hope you have a great life and things improve! bye	0.3333	3.0	2.0	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	19	It was nice chatting with you.    goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	2	I agree. I feel like we are not doing enough about mental illness as a society	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	3	We aren't.   I am so tired of physicians sending you to a therapist to talk about your childhood or given medicine that doesn't work.   No one listens to the patient at all.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	4	Exactly! It's very rare you find a good therapist. Most of them just can't wait to get home.	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	5	Yes!   I have suffered from dark depression my entire life.   It has nothing to do with your childhood.   You were wired that way at birth.   To date, physicians are just initially tapping how to help people.    Such a long way to go.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	6	It must have been really tough for you. I think i have mild depression and it's such a struggle.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	7	Oh it is.   Your family doesn't know how to help.   I just stay exhausted and really never socialize.   It really has nothing for therapists to address.   They can help victims of assault, etc. but they do not help for depression.   At least, that's been the case for me.    I'm sorry you suffer from it.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
25	8	Yeah it's terrible. I have anxiety as well and everyday is a struggle to be honest	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	281.0	17.0	24.0
25	9	Just know I totally understand.   From personal experience, I think anxiety and depression go hand and hand.   I have a lot of anxiety around people or social settings.   What about you?	1.0	3.3333	3.0	2	281.0	8.0	524.0
27	0	This article just makes it so clear how little tolerance there really is in the world. It's sad we claim we are all so much more civilized these days, but the truth is we still seem people are more different than the same.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	1	It is really sad	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	10	I think so too. If religion is such an important aspect of their lives, why don't the leaders have more power to control the out of control elements of their religion?	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	11	I wonder as too as well	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	12	I just don't understand a religion that allows for the harm of those that aren't looking to harm you.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	13	I think we should even put religion aside, it is never right to kill another person	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	14	I agree that killing is wrong. However, regarding this article it is nearly impossible to set religion aside as it is the reason the killings are happening.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	15	oh yes you are right. I just wish Christians and Muslims can coexist peacefully	0.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	16	I don't understand why they can't. If both sides have elements of tolerance built right into the religion who is to say it's right to set aside those elements?	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	17	I think both religion should do all they can to promote peace	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	18	I wish they would. I mean taking the article into consideration again, even if you forget the killing the damage done in the name of religion needs to be addressed. Both sides need to do more to remember peace, tolerance and acceptance is better than violence and hatred.	1.0	3.6667	2.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	19	We can only continue to hope things get better while moving forward	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	2	I find it interesting that so many people still use religion as an excuse for violence and only focus on the most violent parts of the religion and ignore the preachings of tolerance and peace.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	20	I do have hope. I mean on a person to person basis the idea of tolerance and peace seems so simple and easy. It just seems that when we take it to a global stage we start forgetting the meaning of those words.	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	21	me too, i will continue to do all i can as well to support peace	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	22	I too always try to promote acceptance and understanding. Perhaps if we all keep trying things will start to improve.	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	23	you are right mate	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	24	In the long run I guess we are left with the same thing as always -- hope for the future.	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	25	our new generation must be proud of the choice we made today as regards religion	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	26	I would like to think they would be. Religion is so tough to judge as people tend to interpret it for their own uses.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	27	And so sad considering that some people has been brainwashed and not so much we can do to change that	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	28	This is very true. The twisting of religion to use others to bring about your own desires is very sad. I think we've had a good discussion here. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, goodbye.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	29	I think so too, it was a great discussion. bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	3	I was gutted for those that were killed, and nothing was done as well	2.0	4.6667	3.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	4	It is sad that there doesn't seem to be any way to help those people from the article. Even if they wanted to go back so much has been destoryed that you can understand why they'd want to stay away.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	5	Thinking about this, I can only think what can really be done to curb this act	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	6	Until there is a change in the way extremists think and act, I can't see a way this will change.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	7	you are absolutely right	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
27	8	I often wonder how a religion that millions can follow peacefully is allowed to be twisted by those same followers and used to do so much evil. Don't you think the islamic followers should do more to police the extremists?	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	171.0	44.0	26.0
27	9	I think the Islamic leaders should speak out more against this act	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	171.0	5.0	526.0
30	0	I felt sad for these people being persecuted for their beliefs.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	1	yeah, having every place with any a shred of personal significance leveled and re-purposed must be an awful feeling.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	10	yeah seriously, barbaric almost or just archaic.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	11	How do you feel about them rounding up people to use as human shields?	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	12	that's absolutely despicable.  what do you think	2.0	4.3333	3.0	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	13	I'm just wondering how exactly they are using them and couldn't that human resource be applied more practically? It just seems like such a waste.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	14	it is highly unethical, I can't think of a situation where that would ever be ok	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	15	oh, i'm not condoning the activity. I'm just wondering why? just, why?	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	16	Yeah, like what would possess someone to even do that?	1.6667	3.6667	1.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	17	hate, most likely hate.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	18	yes, and pure evil	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	19	well, thanks for chatting! bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	2	yeah seriously.  It made me very grateful to be an American.	0.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	20	bye!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	3	I'm not sure how I feel about our government being directly involved, but it is nice to not have to worry about being hit with a missile in the middle of the night.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	4	yes no doubt, and to be free to believe what we want to believe	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	5	It's kind of inspiring how so many people with different religious backgrounds seemed to be living in relative peace before the Islamic State showed up.	0.0	2.0	2.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	6	yeah seriously.  They seem to bring conflict wherever they go	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	7	They seem to think they are on some kind of holy crusade.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
30	8	yes it almost seems delusional	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	171.0	24.0	29.0
30	9	definitely anachronistic. It seems like they're from some different timeline.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	171.0	25.0	529.0
31	0	its tought to have PTSD	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	1	Yeah, do you know anyone with PTSD?	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	10	yes we treat our veterans terribly speaks alot about our country	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	11	yeah some of them even get deported	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	12	the illegals	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	13	nope some of them are legal. got deported after fighting for our country	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	14	why would that happen	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	15	because they did something small like J walking or anything considered illegal. Even a	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	16	thats terrible	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	17	hope they research this PTSD and find solutions	2.0	4.6667	2.0	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	18	yes maybe one day artificial intelligence will turn us to cyborgs	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	19	should happen in the future	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	2	yes my cousin is a vet	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	20	yes skynet will become self aware	2.0	2.6667	4.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	21	wonder how a cyborg brain would work	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	22	half man half amazing it was nice talking to you goodbye	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	23	bye	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	3	Thats terrible. I hear most of them suffer in silence	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	4	yes they do	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	5	Have you ever had a panic attack? That's one of the things they go through according to the article.	1.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	6	No I stay pretty calml	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	7	what do you think can be done to prevent PTSD	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
31	8	I think we need to spend more for veterans mental health	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	386.0	45.0	30.0
31	9	i agree with that	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	386.0	10.0	530.0
32	0	what did you think about this article	0.6667	4.3333	3.6667	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	1	I think a lot of people are experiencing PTSD from combat.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	10	Or I just hope wars will lessen and lessen over 50 years and there is nothing/nobody fighting but that is high hope	0.0	3.0	3.0	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	11	Yes, a high hope, but there at least seems to be a move towards smaller conflicts.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	12	Yes I think so... Unless something big happens	0.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	13	I think the relative strength and destructiveness of major powers does inhibit large-scale conflict.  Too much destruction to risk going to war, so we fought proxy battles and use diplomacy and sanctions and things like that more than hot wars.  But of course one leader could change that.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	14	"That is true, we are leaning more towards that method of ""war"" or preventing it. But yes, I mean look at WWII all it takes is one person more or less"	0.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	15	And if hostile aliens show up then all bets are off.	0.0	3.0	2.3333	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	16	haha I hope that doens't happy	0.0	3.3333	3.0	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	17	It would probably bring the planet together, but could also spell our doom, or enslavement, or something.  I only bring it up jokingly because of that UFO story recently.	0.0	2.0	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	18	Haha I figured... But i mean who reallly knows!	0.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	19	Yeah, it's a big universe.  We probably don't know as much about it as we'd like to think.	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	2	I agree... and it's sad they don't have the support from their country like they should	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	20	For sure... it's been nice chatting. Bye	0.0	3.0	3.6667	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	21	Yeah, stay cool.  bye	0.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	22	bye	0.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	3	I don't know much about the VA and the support it provides or doesn't.	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	4	I used to work in the VA doing medical data entry... it's always so backed up and people just do the bare minimum to try and keep up with the demand	0.6667	4.0	3.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	5	Yeah, I can see that happening.  I wonder why this is so prevalent now when it doesn't seem to have been as much of an issue in earlier wars, like WW2	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	6	My bet is people had the same symptoms but were less vocal about them as times have changed.	0.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	7	Could be.  But I think it might be more than that.  We seem less capable of handling stress and anxiety.  I agree that part of it is just more talk about it and being more open, and diagnosing stuff more.  But I think we're less resilient as people for some reason too.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
32	8	"I think that could play into it too, paretns coddle their kids more and such creating less ""strong"" adults"	0.0	3.0	2.6667	1	386.0	44.0	31.0
32	9	"Yes, we definitely live ""soft"" lives in many ways.  At some point I guess our wars will be fought by robots, so maybe this won't be an issue in 50 years."	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	386.0	5.0	531.0
33	0	I feel sorry for the soldiers.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	1	Yeah, it's so bad that they had to suffer in the war and now they have to suffer even out of war.	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	10	Me too, they earned it.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	11	Do you think you would ever be able to go to war	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	12	No and you?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	13	Definitely not. I am a chicken when it comes to that which is why i respect veterans and people serving the nation so much	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	14	Me too	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	15	Hopefully the veterans that make it out are able to find great jobs and live a decent life at least.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	16	Yeah and get health care	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	17	Health care would be a great start!	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	18	and a place to live, they only put their life on the line for us!	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	19	Agreed! Well it was nice talking to you, bye	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	2	Yeah we should do more to support them.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	20	you too! bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	3	I wish there was a way we can donate directly to them.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	4	That would be nice	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	5	I feel bad for their families as well because they're probably impacted.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	6	My father was in the Navy and I have two sisters in the Army	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	7	Wow, that's awesome. Much respect to them. How did it impact your family, if it did at all?	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
33	8	None of them had to do direct battle, but my sisters I see a lot less. One is in Germany and the other is in Japan.	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	386.0	33.0	32.0
33	9	Oh okay, Japan sounds cool. I really hope veterans get the help they need in the future.	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	386.0	19.0	532.0
35	0	This is a subject that is near and dear to my heart as my brother served for 12 years and has suffered with PTSD because of it. I think it is our job, as those citizens that receive the freedoms they fight for, that we should do more to make sure we take care of our veterns.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	1	yes such disrespect should be frown at	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	10	I agree. The more people willing to help. The more our veterans will understand that we want to help them.	0.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	11	And more veteran battling with this will be able to come out and seek out help as well	0.6667	0.6667	1.0	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	12	Exactly. We have to be more willing to talk about this situation so that more veterans will understand that we want to help and that there is help to be found.	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	13	We really need to be warm to them honestly	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	14	I agree. If we treat them as humans and not statistics and let them see we can understand their frustrations and issues I'd like to believe we will make a difference.	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	15	We need to lay good foundation for generations coming as regards this	0.3333	2.0	3.0	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	16	For sure. We need to look at this as a long term commitment and not just a fad of the moment. Our veterans are going to need care for the rest of their lives and they deserve it.	0.3333	1.3333	3.0	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	17	Doing this will increase the morale of people who are willing to serve the country more	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	18	If we show that we are willing to understand them after their service. I think it will help those currently serving and those thinking about it.	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	19	No doubt about that	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	2	I think it should be more than frowned at. We need to focus more on helping our veterans than just about anything else as a society. They are doing what we can't or won't and don't deserve to be forgotten.	0.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	20	I think one of the most important things to remember and consider is we have to treat each veteran as his own person. The cure isn't a one size fits all and we need to dedicate the time and effort needed to make sure each one is treated personally.	0.3333	1.0	0.3333	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	3	Yes these people absolutely give their all to the country	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	4	Exactly and they deserve more from us. We need to make sure PTSD is taken seriously and we do more to help.	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	5	 I think there should be a facility made to help these veteran battling with this	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	6	A facility might be a start, but I think that makes it seem like we want to put them away somewhere so we don't have to see them. I'd rather see more community activities where we interact with them and help them as individuals.	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	7	I will definitely support that	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
35	8	I hope that as more people talk about it more people will also seek help.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	386.0	30.0	34.0
35	9	Well need collective effort of the citizen to make sure this is done	0.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	386.0	17.0	534.0
36	0	I had never considered the zoo animals in countries like Venezuela. How sad.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	1	Me, too. We think about the effects of poverty, war on humans ... but not animals.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	10	Yes, thankfully, haha. And the Great Dane that I babysit gets along relatively well, also.	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	11	That is a lot of dog to babysit! Is your dog a large breed, too?	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	12	He's 50-60 lbs, so mid-range? He's a catahoula.	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	13	I just googled Catahoulas - what gorgeous dogs! And I thought I knew my dog breeds. :)	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	14	I get a lot of funny looks when i mention his breed, sometimes! He is very handsome.	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	15	What's his temperament like?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	16	"Well, I adopted him at 3.5, so I can't testify what is breed standard and what was due to his previous owner/occupation. He was a military family's dog who ""worked"" on base, and he accompanied them to work. But he's wonderful. Very calm, emotionally sensitive. Great with kids. Not any of the agression or hyperactivity you hear about the breed."	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	17	Sounds wonderful - and sounds like you lucked out! Did you adopt him through a special service?	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	18	No, our local animal shelter, actually. The family was being relocated overseas and the base in the other location didn't allow dogs. They released him to the shelter so that his new home would be checked out and verified safe beforehand. We did luck out!	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	19	That's even better. I ask because I have friends who adopted a dog that was being trained as a mobility assistant - but he failed the final test after pulling someone out of a wheelchair to chase a rabbit. :)	0.0	1.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	2	I was kind of concerned when it started talking about zoo owners being fined or punished. It's not really *their* fault.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	20	hahah! those rabbits are tricky!	0.0	2.3333	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	21	Right? And irresistable!	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	22	I'm surprised the dog got to the final test, but I guess it's a good thing a rabbit came by	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	23	LOL, seriously! That would have made for an unpleasant surprise for the new owner	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	24	could have been dangerous! but I'm sure he's a lovely pet	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	25	He was - they taught him to sort recycling (that's Seattle for you) and he was the ring bearer at their wedding	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	26	precious!	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	27	It was absurdly sweet	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	28	Do you have pets yourself? And did your degree focus on specific species?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	29	"I do - I'm not sure what happened, but I have cats ... 5 cats. It's a bit terrifying. And, yes, thanks for asking! I'm technically a ""primatologist"" - I ran around watching monkeys"	0.3333	2.6667	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	3	That's an excellent point. The owners can't change the situation, that isn't fair at all. It isn't as if they want their animals to be sick/die!	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	30	interesting! I almost went into equine studies. instead I got my AKC training certificate and an elementary education degree lol	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	31	Nice! I work with some folks doing applied animal behavior with dogs. Cool stuff. And I teach at community college, so I'm right there with you! :)	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	32	I think we've hit our 15, but it was a fun chat with you!	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	58.0	45.0	35.0

36	35	bye!	0.0	1.0	0.3333	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	4	I thought that embalming/preserving some of the animals was a valid idea, for science, but only if absolutely necessary and only if they were euthanized humanely.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	5	Agreed - I would imagine that would provide a more humane death than starvation/malnutrition. Do you consider yourself to be an animal lover?	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	6	Definitely. Do you?	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	7	Absolutely. My grad degree is in Animal Behavior. :)  Do you have any pets?	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
36	8	That's interesting! I do; a dog and a cat.	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	58.0	45.0	35.0
36	9	Nice! Do they get along?	0.0	1.3333	1.0	2	58.0	27.0	535.0
38	0	I feel like there should be some kind of worldwide contingency plan for situations like this, so the animals won't starve to death in cages.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	1	I know poor animals	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	10	Do you think the animals would fair better if they were simply turned loose?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	11	they might it is a tropical climate	0.0	1.0	1.3333	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	12	I guess it depends on the kinds of animals that are being housed there, but I think giving them a fair shake in the wild is more ethical than starving them to death.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	13	the penguins would have it rough	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	14	I mean, it mentioned that some of the animals hadn't eaten in weeks. I'm sure if they're not feeding them they are also neglecting cleaning and medical care. The poor penguins are probably long gone.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	15	cannabilism	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	16	oh man, I didn't need that visual	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	17	can you imagine the lions	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	18	I don't want too, but I can. Well, thanks for chatting about this horrific situation with me. bye	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	19	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	2	I think i've read about different agencies doing extractions of animals from war torn countries in the middle east, but i'd be willing to be the Venezuelan government would rather have them starve than deal with a foreign presence in their country.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	3	yes do you think we should stop the sanctions	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	4	against Venezuela?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	5	yes	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	6	I think that venezuela is being propped up mostly by Cuba/Russia, so we're kind of shooting the messenger in that regard.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	7	yea they are but our sanctions are starving the people	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
38	8	I think that there is enough going on stateside right now that we should probably shy away from meddling in foreign affairs for the most part, so yes I think we should.	2.0	1.6667	1.0	1	58.0	25.0	37.0
38	9	I agree we need to take care of our own first	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	58.0	33.0	537.0
39	0	Wow. What did you think of the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	1	I thought it was terrible!!  What did you think?	2.0	4.3333	2.3333	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	10	It'd have to be another organization, I think the article mentioned a couple -- IFAW and Four Paws or something? But getting the governments to agree would be tricky.	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	11	yeah exactly.  That would be ideal though if an organization would sponsor that	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	12	Yeah. It's sad how it seems to be going on in a lot of countries. :(	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	13	yeah it really is very, very sad	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	14	And then if the animals are getting that bad of a hand, the actual people are, too. :(	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	15	yes!  all living creatures with feelings.	0.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	16	The fact that we still have famine/hunger issues when there's more than enough food to go around is a true failure of our time	1.0	3.3333	3.0	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	17	yeah and so much waste here in the USA	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	18	Yeah. Do you have any further thoughts?	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	19	no, sorry, do you?	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	2	I found it super upsetting. :( Kinda feels like power + greed wrecks everything -- people, environments, animals. :(	2.0	4.3333	3.0	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	20	i don't think so. bye!	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	21	bye!	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	3	Yes really!!!  I mean, slaughtering horses to feed people and animals?  That is a tragedy!!!!	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	4	Feeding lions pumpkins or whatever caught my eye the most. Like, they're carnivores, that won't keep them alive. What do you think should be done?	1.6667	4.0	2.6667	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	5	Yeah really!  That was crazy.  I really do not know.  Venezuela has deep, deep issues.  Not easy to fix.  Whaty do you think?	1.6667	4.0	2.3333	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	6	I don't know. Zoos are already kinda questionable ethically, but I for sure think you shouldn't have one if you can't take care of it. It seems like the animals should be moved elsewhere.	1.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	7	Yeah I had the exact same thought.  Although what to do with all the animals?  If they just released them suely they would die or be slaughtered	1.3333	3.6667	2.6667	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
39	8	I assume they'd have to be moved somewhere else, maybe another country's zoo or wildlife center until they can be put somewhere permanently?	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	58.0	13.0	38.0
39	9	Yes I thought that too, but who would pay for the move, and who would coordinate it all?	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	58.0	24.0	538.0
40	0	how sad is this situation. poor animals	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	1	It's very sad. These animals definitely do not deserve this.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	10	aww but i also feel like having a dog and giving them attention is way better than locking an animal in a cage and never interacting with it	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	11	Yeah that is true. I think zoos are terrible but if we never had zoos, it'd be really hard to see most of these animals	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	12	true they are very cute and at least in the united states we know they arent starving	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	13	I guess that's true. You feel bad for these animals too because they're taken away from their familes. ( or maybe they're just rescues)	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	14	yea you never really hear where they get the animals from I hope they are all rescued	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	15	Do you enjoy going to the zoo?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	16	I honestly never had it is always hot and smells kind of gross. How about you?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	17	It is very fun!  I would recommend going just to see all the animals up close	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	18	it sounds like a fun experience I went a couple of times when I was young but do not remember it at all.	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	19	Interesting, definitely give it another go! Well it was nice talking to you, bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	2	right  that government is a mess someone needs to step in	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	20	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.3333	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	3	Yeah! I mean even zoos in the US, i feel bad for the animals.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	4	me too. I hate seeing them locked in cages doesnt seem right.	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	5	It's just weird to think about. People take these animals away, put them in cages, just so they can make money.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	6	yea and they brainwash you into thinking theyre helping the animals	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	7	Exactly. How often do you see a lion exhibit with just 1 lion. What do you think it does all day? It's so sad.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
40	8	if you think about it some people do that to cats and dogs when theyre not allowed outside. I wonder if theyre saad too	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	58.0	16.0	39.0
40	9	Definitely. I am actually guilty of that. I have 1 dog whom i never walked outside because we lived in a tiny apartment. Now she has issues as she gets older, terrible anxiety.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	58.0	17.0	539.0
42	0	I thought it was very sad but also kind of uplifting	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	1	Yes it was both.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	10	That sounds rough. Not sure how people deal with it for years.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	11	Not at all! And for me it was experimental. To have that as the ONLY choice and know your odds aren't good anyway? I can't imagine. Some people have tiny survival rates, it's so sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	12	Yeah, I would not blame anyone who decides to take euthanasia	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	13	No, I hear people say all the time they won't put themselves through chemo and I don't blame them. But a lot of cancers are beatable, so people try to hold on to hope. It's hard.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	14	I get that, but also some like pancreatic I hear have less than a 5% survival rate.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	15	That's terrifying	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	16	Extremely as one can only imagine	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	17	I could not handle seeing my spouse go through that. I think it's harder than being sick yourself.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	18	I would certainly breakdown if my spouse went through that	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	19	It's so emotionally draining when someone you love is sick becaue you just want them to be ok but it's so hard to keep yourself going	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	2	It happens all the time which is crazy	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	20	Yeah and all the hospital visits must just add to the stress	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	21	Hospitals are already so depressing and also frustrating at times. never mind when your loved one is sick.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	22	Yeah, and all the bills can stack up quick	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	23	omg yes. Ambulance rides especially! Right at the time you're already stressed.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	24	All hospital visits are absurdly expensive	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	25	And so is insurance which is the only hope you have of staying out of debt	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	26	Yeah, and insurance can also be shady too	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	27	What sucks is just when you are stressed and worried, you have to deal with all of it and it's so complicated. SO many times the insurance and hospital won't communicate so you have to deal with all the calls and everything yourself	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	28	Yeah and the answer machine is always a pain. Also the number of callers ahead of me.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	29	lol yes. THere's so much more to being sick than just being sick.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	3	It always hits me especially hard when it was a celeb I liked as a kid. I guess because as a kid you think the stars are invincible.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	30	Alright, goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	31	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	4	Yeah, I can see that. It also just seems to diminish their health really fast	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	5	I was especially sad to hear how she feels bad when she looks at her husband, she feels guilty while he must just be so worried	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	6	Whenever I see these stories, I always wonder is there is a cure to be found	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	7	My sister in law just beat breast cancer but she had to go through chemo and radiation	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
42	8	The whole ordeal must be very painful, Chemo has so many adverse affects.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	289.0	56.0	41.0
42	9	I went through it but not for cancer. I have an autoimmune disease and they tried chemo on it. I felt like I was dying for 7 months. It completely wiped me out. It sucks.	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	289.0	29.0	541.0
43	0	I was happy she was strong when dealing with cancer.	0.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	1	I am too..I love her courage. Please, let us be fast with this, my time is almost up	0.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	10	I can relate to the host because my mom had cancer.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	11	Wow!!! so sorry about taht. She survived it?	1.0	3.0	2.3333	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	12	Yes, she has to keep getting checked every year.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	13	thats impressive. Can we say our byes now?	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	14	i don know if we had enough turns but we can try.	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	15	ok	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	16	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	17	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	2	It was good she was so self looking	0.3333	2.0	3.6667	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	3	yea..not so many people can do that	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	4	It made me wonder how I would deal with cancer	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	5	I cant imagine that. I am scared of it!!!!	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	6	it had to be scary thinking it was gone to have it come back	1.3333	3.0	4.0	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	7	Yea. I hate the fact that no one has been able to pin down the main cause	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
43	8	Yeah, it  is scary that it can happen to anybody no matter the age or sex	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	289.0	30.0	42.0
43	9	I only hope more research can be done to prevent this.	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	289.0	40.0	542.0
46	0	I remember hearing about this event when it happened.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	1	It's pretty crazy what happened	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	10	yeah, according to the article anyway. I didn't remember hearing that anywhere before.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	11	Yeah, makes me wonder if the author made that up....	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	12	It did say that him being not allowed at the venue wasn't substantiated/proven.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	13	yeah if it aint proven they shouldnt write it	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	14	I'm not sure where the article came from, I didn't pay attention.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	15	I don't believe it said where it came from I just remember them quoting the AFP a lot	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	16	The other band that played at the memorial was Sting, right?	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	17	yeah I remember Sting  played in the first show at the Bataclan or something like that	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	18	yeah the first one since the tragedy. I was surprised to hear he was still playing venues.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	19	yeah these old time bands can go on playing for ages	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	2	I remember thinking that could have been me, because that's the type of show that I'd go see.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	20	I didn't see a correlation with Eagles of Death Metal, though. Two entirely different genres.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	21	thats true didn't think of that hmm thats weird. I think we finished the fifteen turns good job	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	22	thanks. it was nice. bye!	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	23	goodbye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	3	same here the fact that we are all at risk in 2019 for these kinds of things is scary	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	4	Exactly. It wasn't politically directed at the band or venue or concertgoers. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Scary.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	5	Do you think there was a good response to the tragedy?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	6	I'm not sure what a good response could be, but I think it was handled appropriately.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	7	Yeah I agree with the response being good all things considered	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
46	8	"I hadn't heard the statement from the lead singer about security. Until that came up in the article, I didn't understand why he was ""controversial"""	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	210.0	45.0	45.0
46	9	Is he the one that said he thought muslim security personnel at the venue collaborated with the attackers?	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	210.0	19.0	545.0
47	0	What did you think of the article?	0.6667	1.3333	0.3333	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	1	I thought it was good. I did not like the statement Hughes made.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	10	Sadly, it probably will.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	11	Yeah, the bigger issue of terrorism is very complex	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	12	I just can't understand how anyone would want to do something like this.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	13	Me neither, all life needs to be treated with more respect.	0.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	14	I think it's really scary when people for some reason think that killing other people is a good thing. Then what will stop them?	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	15	I think they will always be people like this. sandy hook and other things like that will never make sense to someone like me or you.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	16	They were also holding people hostage, I can't imagine the terror.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	17	Or getting the phone call about a loved one being killed for no reason.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	18	Or waiting to see if your loved one is one of the ones that was killed or is safe?	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	19	I agree, but I can not stress enough that this should not breed hate for others just because their faith.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	2	I just feel so badly for the families of all those people killed.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	20	This is so depressing	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	21	Are you afraid of large events now?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	22	I have never liked crowds, but I do think I tend to stay away from large events more since so many things have been happening. Does it bother you?	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	23	No, I'm more worried about my children at school.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	24	That's super scary too. This whole world is scary. I worry all the time about my kids at school too. I try to teach them to be nice to everyone and talk to the kids that other people pick on. Hopefully, they can spread a little bit of kindness and help if someone is feeling so isolated that they would do something like that.	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	25	Yeah, we all should be nice to each other. I think the internet makes us less caring.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	26	It's crazy what people write to each other in comment sections.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	27	yeah, they do not treat others with respect.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	28	People are very close minded.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	29	Sadly I do not see them changing anytime soon.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	3	Me too, Going out to have a good time and have monsters do this to people you love.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	30	It's been good talking to you!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	31	You too.	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	32	I hope you have  good day	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	33	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	34	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	4	And for what reason? I just can't figure it out.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	5	There is no good reason, but I would never blame all Muslims.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	6	No, that's a big problem. It's nice that Sting had a concert and a moment of silence.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	7	Yeah, I liked the love that they showed the people.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
47	8	I'm sure so many people want to help and do something, but I really don't know if there is anything that will make the hurt go away for the families.	0.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	210.0	57.0	46.0
47	9	I agree, nothing can stop the pain from that day. I pray it never happens again.	1.3333	3.6667	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	546.0
48	0	To me the saddest thing about reading the article was i had completely forgotten about this Paris attack.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	1	Yes it was very sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	10	That is definetely one of the scarier attacks. My mother is an elementary teacher and after the attack i remember her being afraid and scared as they had to do drills at schools. These are so frequent it feels like there is just nothing that can be done but to hope the response is quick to them.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	11	These shooting are pure evil.	2.0	4.6667	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	12	They really are, makes me sick to my stomach to think that there are even people capable of killing innocents like this	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	13	I don't like when people kill themselves, but if you feel that way don't take anybody with you.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	14	I agree, ideally i would love if these people got help and were able to fix whatever is wrong with them but do not take it out on others. It feels like there is still a mental health stigma that makes people unlikely to get help	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	15	A lot people are angry and feel like they don't fit in.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	16	Definetely but how do they go from that feeling to i am going to shoot up a crowd of innocent people. I think that is where we need to focus on the tipping point.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	17	I agree with that. I think the gun problem is too late to stop.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	18	I agree, they are ingrained within society and people feel strongly about them. Alongside that at the end of the day it feels like these individuals would commit these acts with or without access to a firearm	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	19	Yeah this is a human problem.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	2	Incredibly sad, and such a realization of how often these tradgedies happen	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	20	Definitely, well even though to topic was sad it was nice talking to you. goodbye	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	21	you too! bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	3	These past years there has been too many.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	4	There really has, it scares me to think that we are all becoming numb to this and just accepting this overall.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	5	There was a FBI report about the new Joker movie that is opening soon.	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	6	I saw people talking about that, I hope nothing bad happens. I remember that there was shooting at the Dark Knight a decade ago.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	7	Yeah, I know people are blaming the movie, but the movie has nothing to do with it in my eyes.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
48	8	I agree, i know people are just desperate and looking to blame something but at the end of the day the blame can only fall onto the people that actually commit these crimes.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	210.0	23.0	47.0
48	9	The most chilling for me was Sandy hook. I have two children in elementary right now, it's scary.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	210.0	30.0	547.0
49	0	what did you think about this	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	1	its a sad and harsh reality	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	10	yea we need a bigger wall and start banning these muslims	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	11	ah i'm not to educated on this but i am glad there is talks of solutions.	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	12	yes the muslims are to blame	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	13	I see where your anger is coming from i just feel as though there are good and bad people of every race/ religon and we need to somehow figure out how to find the bad ones	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	14	its easy to figure that out ban young males from coming in	1.0	3.0	1.0	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	15	what are your thoughts on the school shootings going on in america	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	16	its the drugs that they are taking no one talks about it	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	17	Very goo point! I believe more people need to be armed	0.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	18	yes I am ready for the coming economic crisis	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	19	Ive heard talks of recession which is scary all we can do is prepare and hope for the best i guess.	1.3333	3.0	1.0	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	2	yes it is these muslim terrorists	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	20	yep get some food and livestock if you can chickens too	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	21	good idea. I have a lot of food storage and emergency preparedness kits but having live animals would be a good idea.	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	22	yea at least the chickens for the eggs	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	23	great idea, i cannot even imagine if that happens how people would act but it is good to be armed	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	24	yes nice chatting bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	25	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	3	it was very nice for the band to come back and visit the memorial	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	4	yes it was a decent thing to do	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	5	I wish people would stop hurting eachother	0.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	6	they can't until they take that out of the genome	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	7	It's crazy how bad it is everywhere	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
49	8	its only getting worse	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	210.0	33.0	48.0
49	9	yea i am happy people are trying to prevent this in the united states	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	210.0	16.0	548.0
50	0	Hello what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	1	I think it was a little messed up for the frontman of the band to say that he thought security collaborated with the attackers.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	10	It's terrible. I feel like they should be put away	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	11	yeah what do you think is the approrpriate punishment	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	12	I think if someone were to commit mass murder, death is the only punishment. You?	1.6667	3.0	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	13	i think death is too quick. maybe life in solitary confinement	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	14	I just feel like if you are able to take the lives of 50+ people, you honestly don't deserve a second chance\	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	15	yeah they deserve to suffer slowly	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	16	Do you think these people were born like this? Or is are they product of environment	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	17	they are definitely born like that or maybe a mixture of both. what do you think?	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	18	I would say a mixture of both is a good answer. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.6667	2.6667	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	2	That was a little weird, i agree. It's good that they went to pay their respects though	0.0	2.3333	2.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	3	What do you think can be done to prevent these attacks in the future	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	4	I honestly don't know. I would say ban guns but poeple will just find other ways.	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	5	yeah they'd probably just switch to knives	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	6	OR even making things like bombs, or just running people over with cars.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	7	yeah they seem to use vans to run people over a lot	2.0	1.6667	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
50	8	I think people will always find ways to kill.. no matter what you do. Doesn't matter what you ban	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	210.0	17.0	49.0
50	9	yeah some people are just naturally violent	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	210.0	19.0	549.0
51	0	How you feel about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	1	I feel sad and worried about the polar bears. You?	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	10	I think we should create more awareness, so it will help the generations coming more	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	11	Yes. But I am afraid it will be too late and the damage will be done.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	12	If we start now there is a lot we can still achieve	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	13	What should we start with aside from awareness? More clean energy maybe?	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	14	I will suggest renewable energy	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	15	I agree, but I think there also needs to be laws and regulations in place because there are people who just don't care	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	16	Yes there should strict laws that will enforce this acts	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	17	It's not going to happen here in the US with the current president unfortunately.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	18	it is quite sad, but this is a global problem	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	19	It is, which makes it even harder.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	2	I feel same way	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	20	So true, this honestly requires collective effort	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	21	I guess we can just do our part by raising awareness and not being wasteful	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	22	we should start from our homes i guess and our immediate enviroment	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	23	Yes that's a good start and the more people doing it the better	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	24	That is so true, in my home i make use of energy saving bulbs. this will help conserve more energy	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	25	That's a great idea. We turn off all the lights during the day and make sure we always turn them off when we leave the room. And we unplug appliances that aren't being used	0.0	2.0	2.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	26	That sounds interesting as well	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	27	I try to teach my kids about saving energy too. And we make sure we recycle and neve litter	0.0	2.0	2.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	28	That is a great idea, like i said earlier we need to create a great environment for the generations to come	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	29	Yes that's true, there needs to be more encouragement for kids though, in school and at home	0.0	1.6667	2.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	3	I'm really concerned that there are people who still don't believe this is happening and think global warming is a hoax.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	30	We will continue to hope things get better on the long run, it has been great chatting with you. goodbye	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	31	You too	0.6667	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	32	you need to type bye or goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	33	Bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	34	lower case	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	35	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	36	let us do it again	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	37	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	38	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	4	There should be more awareness in this regards	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	5	The problem is people who don't want to listen. And now the polar bears are suffering.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	6	I'm really sad for the polar bears	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	7	There needs to be more awareness raised but it seems like it is just too late.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
51	8	I do not think it is too late	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	49.0	5.0	50.0
51	9	What do you think we can do?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	49.0	47.0	550.0
53	0	I feel sorry for the polar bears. I wonder what behavioral changes biologists are noticing in their behavior.  Certainly the bears will change something to try to survive, although the Arctic doesn't give them too many options, probably.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	1	I feel awful for them too. I hope scientists are able to fix the problem	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	10	I don't think most people have the will, and developing countries are the biggest question, not the already-developed world.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	11	that is true, still I hope something changes	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	12	Are you doing anything about it or just hoping?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	13	I do what little I can. but of course I still have to use gas to get around and stuff	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	14	Right, and that's the biggest impediment to any substantive change.  People aren't willing to live a lifestyle other than the one they know.  I've thrown up my hands and think it's all pointless.  The dye is cast.  Now we reap what we've sown.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	15	maybe. but now most car manufacturers are making electric vehicles, so in the near future there will be less of a need for gas	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	16	Agree, but apparently there are much larger problems than just cars.  Apparently the concrete industry is like the single-worst thing, and nobody talks about that at all.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	17	there are also problems like pollution, especially in India and china	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	18	Yes, those countries are terrible.  We worry over here about plastic straws and stuff like that, but that stuff is totally irrelevant.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	19	they have had to release flesh-eating turtles into the Ganges river to get rid of all of the dead bodies	2.0	2.0	0.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	2	I wonder if we can even do anything about it?  Even if we decrease CO2 production, their environment might continue to melt away.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	20	That's pretty horrific.	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	21	yeah I know, its a huge problem there	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	22	Anyway, I'm about done.  Unless you want to say anything else I'll end the conversation in the next round.	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	23	ok, thanks. have a great rest of your day	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	24	you too.  bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	25	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	3	I don't know, I'm not qualified to answer that - I just hope something can be done for them	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	4	They're definitely majestic animals.  It seems ironic that something that's so big and powerful can seem so impotent in the face of the vicissitudes of mother nature.	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	5	I agree. I want them to be around for a long time	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	6	Still, we tend to think that the world is supposed to be the way we know it now.  We, like polar bears, have only existed for the tiniest fraction of the earth's and universe's history.  And yet we thing it's anomalous for us to not be here.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	7	I agree. I don't wish for any creature to suffer or go extinct	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
53	8	I imagine that the increasing push to get oil out of the Arctic will further threaten the polar bears' habitat.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	49.0	48.0	52.0
53	9	I agree, but I hope not. hopefully we can rely on a more renewable source of energy soon	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	49.0	7.0	552.0
54	0	So, how do you feel about the disappearance of the familiar frozen arctic?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	1	I feel terrible about it, and you?	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	10	Oh, i'm not advocating for less dissemination of information. The more things like this are highlighted without political bias the more people will be receptive to taking action.	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	11	Agreed, so tell me what your suggestions are?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	12	I think that we need to take a more active approach in the control of the climate. We need to stop treating it as something supernal because humans can obviously bend it to their own selfish wills. Such as, dumping iron oxide into the ocean to create super massive blooms of plankton. This will not only effectively remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, but sequester it in living things that will thrive off of the nutrition; passing that down the line and enriching our depleted oceans.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	13	And this change should begin with us, from our homes	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	14	Go on..	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	15	I think making use of energy saving bulbs, not throwing dirt anywhere just do something to help conserve the energy more and help the climate	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	16	I agree that making more environmental choices in the home will help people adjust for a low energy future, but even at scale those kinds of actions won't do anything to prevent the acceleration of climate change. It's nice for an American to do these paltry things and go to bed at night with a sense of satisfaction, but the events that have been set in motion will have dire consequences for those less fortunate.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	17	oh wow. I just really feel sad for the bears really	2.0	3.0	4.3333	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	18	That's why they're used as a poster child for something much larger. Polar bears are cute and fluffy and easy to feel compassion for from a great distance. Humans being cooked to death and dying from thirst isn't as cuddly.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	19	We need to do something the generation coming will be proud of as regards climate change	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	2	I feel similarly, mostly because I feel so helpless. Like, the damage has already been done and we are cursed to watch the tragedy unfold.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	20	I agree! Thanks for chatting! bye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	21	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	3	I am so sad that the polar bears are really suffering because of this	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	4	Them along with 30,000 other species that are on the brink of extinction because of the changing climate and the encroachment of humanity. How do you deal with it?	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	5	This is a lot to swallow. We need to find a way of solving this	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	6	So, your hopeful that there is a practical solution?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	7	I really hope, hopefully more awareness?	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
54	8	I don't know, I think that awareness is pretty high even in remote and developing countries. I think that the biggest obstacle at present is outright denial being popularized by psuedo-authoritarian governments.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	49.0	25.0	53.0
54	9	This too, but that should not stop more awareness as this is a global issue	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	49.0	5.0	553.0
55	0	Hello what did you think about the articel?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	1	Really sad and really frustrating. :( I wish we were doing more to stop it.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	10	I recently saw it. I understand and side with her but i felt it was a bit aggressive	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	11	She definitely feels very strongly about it. It's just a little mindboggling to me that one of the most well known voices is 16.	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	12	Yeah but it also gives me hope for the next generation as well!	0.0	3.0	0.6667	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	13	Yeah, there's a lot of movement and political awareness it seems like.	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	14	So would you say you are doing anything to help the climate	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	15	I do most of the basic stuff--try to get local food, avoid waste, cut down on gas/electrics as much as possible. Cutting down on gas is hard though since I live in a smaller town w no public transportation.	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	16	That's good. I definitely need to start doing more because i am still in the mindset that what i do won't make much of a difference since i'm only one person	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	17	It definitely can feel that way, especially considering how much pollution the big companies are pumping out.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	18	Yup. Let's hope the future gets better for everyone.. and everything. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	19	bye!	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	2	It's so sad because we're just doing more harm instead of helping	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	3	Yeah. Both of my parents and most the my family actually denies it's happening. Thanksgiving's going to be real fun this year.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	4	Oh wow, how do they explain things that are happening like in the article?	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	5	"Just say it's natural/the earth ""always does this."" It's mind blowing."	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	6	I never asked my parents but i'm sure they think the same to be honest	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	7	Unfortunately. :( And it's so frustrating bc it means we're blocked from getting things done to change it.	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
55	8	Yup! This is why i think we need a younger presidential candidate in office for the next election. Smeone who will be able to understand things like climate change and not live in the old ways.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	49.0	17.0	54.0
55	9	Indeed. Have you been following the movement around Greta Thornburg?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	49.0	13.0	554.0
56	0	Hi there, so what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	1	Hello, I thought it was very interesting but not really surprising	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	10	Yeah I agree.  All they have to do is walk across an imaginary line and they suddenly have a different level of protection.  That does not make logical sense.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	11	I wonder if Africa's development and modernization are correlated with poaching at all. I would like to believe this would decrease poaching as an industry	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	12	I would like to think that too, but I would imagine there is a very long way to go before there is a big difference	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	13	What makes you say that?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	14	I don't see poaching decreasing or disappearing dramatically overnight.  I think it would take a long period of time and be a gradual change	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	15	Kenya just recently instituted the death penalty for poachers. What do you think would be some good ways to discourage poaching?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	16	That sounds sufficient.  Like I said, I know nothing about this topic so it is great that you are educating me.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	17	I don't know much myself. I don't support the death penalty generally and in this case I don't see how it would help. Poachers will move further south and increase their activities in other parts of the continent. I think on balance this will just lead to more poaching	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	18	I guess you would have to see if the amount of poaching actually decreases in response to the death penalty.  It would depend on how it were enforced.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	19	I think that is the biggest problem that conservation efforts in Africa face. Enforcement. If the African nations even agree on what measures to take, they almost never enforce them rigorously.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	2	Yeah no doubt.  The only part I was surprised by (but I know practically nothing on this subject) was that elephant populations had increased in some areas and were a nuisance to the locals	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	20	Exactly, and then there is corruption in the government as well so that would be an issue.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	21	Do you think the international community has a duty to intervene at this point?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	22	No, but I disagree with the international community getting involved in each other's affairs in general.  This is an African issue that should be solved by the parties there in my opinion.  What do you think	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	23	I don't think the African nations can take the helm. The more time they spend disagreeing the more threatened elephant populations become. I really think the UN should be more actively involved. Perhaps not with legislation, but definitely with enforcement.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	24	Well that's certainly one way to look at it.  Regardless,  I hope they are able to work something out that is satisfactory to all the nations involved	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	25	I hope so. We can not continue to do nothing as a global society. More and more animals are going extinct. I just read an article that stated that the last known female Yangtze Turtle in the wild died recently.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	26	Well that is sad.  There are species going extinct all the time.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	27	Yes that is true, but more and more are going extinct because of human activities. That has to change	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	28	And also due to natural changes in the environment which are outside of our control.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	29	I hope you enjoy your day as well. bye	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	3	I thought it was interesting that some African nations actually want to lift the ban on ivory trading and argued that it would help elephant populations. lol	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	4	yeah that does not make sense to me.  why on earth	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	5	It may have to do with competition from mammoth ivory in Russia	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	6	you clearly know more about this than me, but yeah I guess that would make sense.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	7	Do you think it makes sense to have some elephants listed as appendix 1 animals and others not?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
56	8	I don't know enough about it to say.  Elephants from certain countries were appendix 1 and others were appendix 2, correct?  what do you think?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	72.0	24.0	55.0
56	9	As it was stated in the article elephants don't have passports. It doesn't make sense for them to have different protections on different sides of a border. This would just create ''arbitrage'' opportunities that poachers would no doubt exploit	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	72.0	35.0	555.0
60	0	What did you think of this?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	1	It made me very sad.  All those beautiful Savannah Elephants slaughtered for ivory.	2.0	4.3333	4.0	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	10	same here!  It is frustrating to have such a big problem with no solutioon	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	11	It just seems the head of animals (I don't know the proper term) knows how the whole process works and could implement something.   I'm sure people are paid off etc.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	12	yeah for sure they are.  maybe harsher penalties??	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	13	Has to be - If you are facing prison time in Africa not the US and excessive monetary penalties, that possibly could reduce it	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	14	maybe so, I wonder if they have tried that yet?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	15	Not that I am aware of - I was hoping the article had a brief narrative regarding that instead of all the %s.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	16	yeah I didn't see anything about it either	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	17	The solution could be stop making things that are ivory.   If no one uses it,  less elephants would be killed.   Piano keys etc. could be made out of something differently.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	18	YES, eliminate the market.  I must go, take care!  bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	19	Enjoyed chatted goodbye	0.0	2.0	0.3333	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	2	Yes, I thought it was a tragedy.  And for what??  greed	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	3	I swear human beings are the worst.  It's me, me, me, me.   They should be assessed astronomical finds and prison time.	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	4	Yeah no doubt.  Then it would be oh poor me, woe is me.  I'm the victim.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	5	Yes it would.   I live in Colorado so bears, elk, and mountain lions are everywhere.   Stupid people come to Colorado with no knowledge of large animals.   Then they get attacked, etc. and the Department of Wildlife  has to kill the animal.   Makes me so mad.	2.0	4.0	2.3333	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	6	yeah that is unfair to the animal.  people should educate themselves first	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	7	What else really caught your attention in the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
60	8	it just seemed there was no good solution to this	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	72.0	24.0	59.0
60	9	I know.   I really was thinking about what could be done and how could it be tracked?   I couldn't think of anything.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	72.0	8.0	559.0
62	0	Hi there - I was very surprised to find out that China allowed women to become pilots at all	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	1	Yea I was a bit surprised at that but more so surprised that she was killed by another plane's wing hitting her.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	10	Nope. I just didn't think that women would been seen as capable enough to fly airplanes within that cultural context.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	11	Do you know if there are many women pilots in the US armed forces?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	12	That's a great question. I don't know that there are a lot, but I don't think they are entirely rare, either. But I'm really talking out of my rear here. :) I don't know much about the military - do you?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	13	Not many specifics. I can see how measures related to physical safety would be different for women related to g-force protection and the like	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	14	Interesting, I hadn't thought of that! In what ways do you think they would be different?	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	15	It would make sense that a smaller person would have different thresholds that they can handle	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	16	Right. That makes sense. Switching gears: what do you think of the officials being unable to assign fault for the death? Wasn't the reason clear?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	17	Probably just trying to avoid having to punish somebody for this. I think the reason of death is clear just not who caused it.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	18	The whole thing is sad. I wonder what protocol changes will be made (if any) because of it	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	19	I'm not sure which protocols would need to be changed. Maybe the distance that planes can be close to one another?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	2	Agreed. What are the odds of that happening?	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	20	That seems like a good place to start	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	21	Do you think this hurts the chances of more women becoming pilots?	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	22	I hadn't thought of that. Maybe? I don't think it would keep women from wanting to become pilots - flying is always risky - but I wonder if public opinion will turn against women flying. What do you think?	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	23	I think this may deter women from becoming pilots if special measures are not taken to protect them.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	24	I wonder if anything like this has happened to male pilots in China? Would that story be a big deal like this one?	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	25	Probably not. It's not that big of a story if a male dies doing this. Just the way it is.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	26	In China or in general?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	27	In general I guess. It's the norm for male soldiers to die but women get the publicity as it is more rare.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	28	That's probably true, although I think the way that it happened would get press if it happened in the US. Such a freak occurrance	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	29	True. Would the male be made out to be a hero though?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	3	Pretty low. The fact that she was hit by another plane would imply that proper protocols were not followed.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	30	I would actually say yes, but I bet there would be more press/sympathy if it was a woman	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	31	Heh. Maybe true equality will come one day. I'm about out of thoughts on this article though!	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	32	LOL, me too. We've hit 15, so - have a nice day! bye	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	33	bye :)	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	4	Definitely. Do you have any experience in aviation?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	5	haha not particularly but it would seem that there should be measures in place to protect pilots that eject	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	6	Absolutely - so someone messed up big time. It was heartwarming to hear that she is broadly seen as a hero	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	7	Yea at least they see her as one. Kind of a shame that it's such a big deal that a women is a pilot.	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
62	8	Yeah, sadly, I don't think of China as being at the forefront of the feminist movement. ;) I'm shocked women are let near a cockpit!	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	150.0	27.0	61.0
62	9	Do you feel as if women need special safety measures compared to me?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	150.0	2.0	561.0
63	0	I'm of two minds about this article. On the one hand, yay first female fighter pilot in China. On the other, she was flying in aerobatic shows. Is that really groundbreaking?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	1	Yeah she wasn't doing anything that makes your jaw drop.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	10	Now that's an interesting thought. You mean some sort of sabotage?	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	11	Yeah something like that is what I'm thinking happened.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	12	Then my biggest question would be about her male copilot - since he ejected safely, would it be possible he had something to do with it?	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	13	more than likely it was probably to prove a point to people that females cant do the job by the people that sabotaged the jet.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	14	I guess that's a good possibility, especiallly when you think about all fo the people who were saying that this is proof women can't be fighter pilots	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	15	Regardless if true or not it is an interesting theory	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	16	It's also very easy to think that if there was sabotage, it's possible it would be used to create a martyr of sorts. Someone that Chinese women could look up to	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	17	Makes sense since the All-China Womens Federation reported that 60 million users of the Weibo site had clicked on Yu's story.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	18	I think I've run out of conversation about this topic and am ready to say goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	19	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.3333	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	2	Do you think she would have ever seen combat? Or at least flown for their military?	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	3	Probably seeing as China would of loved some good publicity in the news.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	4	There are three other remaining female pilots I think. I wonder if this will impact their service.	1.0	1.0	2.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	5	Do you think women should be allowed to fly these jets?	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	6	I believe so. I was just reading about how women were excluded from the space program in the 60s even though they were physically more able to withstand the forces on their bodies	1.0	1.0	2.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	7	I agree with that. Yu's friends say she was a positive, humb,e and nice person who loved taking care of her friends so that just makes it more disappointing.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
63	8	I do wonder what went wrong. I also wonder if the people who think women should be kept out of the military would use this as a way to justify their views.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	150.0	55.0	62.0
63	9	Do you think there might of been something going on there seeins as she was the first female to do it?	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	150.0	19.0	562.0
64	0	So, how do you feel about the coverage of this so-called accident?	1.3333	0.6667	0.6667	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	1	I think the accident is horrible, could you imagine dying like that?	2.0	4.3333	4.3333	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	10	Yeah, that was very heartening. Also, it didn't mention anything about her family.	0.3333	3.3333	3.0	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	11	She got to make her dream come true and she died doing what she loved so that is a plus but I never like to hear about a death	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	12	I also wonder about the logistics of her death. Was she struck by a third plane not involved in the initial collision? Did the pilot and co-pilot of the other plane eject as well? There's just a lot of details that aren't covered in the article.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	13	Yeah I agree there is many unanswered questions	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	14	And the government seemed unwilling to answer many of those questions. It was probably just a freak accident, but i'm always suspicious of people's motivations.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	15	yes for sure, do you believe that it is a true story? do you think we could find additional coverage on the story? Do you remember her name?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	16	Her name was Yu Xu. There are lots of articles available online concerning the accident and even videos on YouTube. I think that the story id probably true, but I think the cause of the accident is suspect. Maybe flaws in aviation technology that would make Chinese engineers lose face.	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	17	Ok, I love watching documentaries, I like true television not so much a fan of fiction	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	18	I also enjoy watching documentaries. Have you seen any good ones lately?	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	19	I am supposed to be in one about Mturk and the gig economy later on this year and it will be on Netflix...I'm excited	0.3333	2.6667	0.6667	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	2	Honestly, no. Being struck by an aircraft after ejecting due to a collision? The level of adrenaline must have been unreal.	1.3333	4.0	4.0	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	20	No way, really? That's neat. Well, thanks for chatting! bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	21	Yes I was contacted by some woman named Shannon Walsh...I didnt believe it at first but I did some research and it is legit...she is a film maker from canada...I talked with her on the phone and they are going to be here in Florida either next month or september. I really enjoyed chatting with you goodbye	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	3	I will not get on a plane, I couldnt imagine being killed in the air	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	4	Really? You've never been on an airplane?	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	5	lol nope, I'll drive anywhere I need to go	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	6	Right on. I thought the lack of details concerning the cause of the crash was a little suspect.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	7	Do you think she was in some way sabotaged?	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
64	8	I mean, you can't really say. But, state run media is always a little suspect to me. Plus, the statements supposedly taken from Yu were very sterile and robotic.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	150.0	25.0	63.0
64	9	I like how she was so proud of herself for being the first woman to pilot the fighter jet	0.0	3.0	3.0	2	150.0	10.0	563.0
65	0	Hi, what did you think of this?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	1	I felt really sad for the woman and her family. What about you?	2.0	2.3333	4.3333	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	10	Yeah I can't do it anymore, I find it to be a nightmare.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	11	I was on one time and the plane dropped for like 2 seconds before regaining balance. The pilot apologized but everyone was s cared outta their minds	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	12	omg.  yeah, no, I refuse.  I used to fly when I Was younger but now I will drive or not go.	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	13	Yup! Agreed. Hopefully teh family of the woman are all fine now. It must be really hard losing a family member like that.	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	14	Yeah I can't imagine.  I would think they have adjusted but are not fine.  very tragic	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	15	I can't even imagine training all your life for this and then just having it taken away.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	16	yeah and she didn't even know I guess	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	17	Nope, reminds me of a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. You never know what's going to happen.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	18	Yeah seriously!  I try to avoid dangerous situations but you still never know.  being in a car is dangerous.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	19	Yup, gotta live everyday like it's your last! (or at least try to). Well it was nice talking to you! bye	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	2	Yes I agree, ,my heart went out to the family, so sad	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	20	so true!  bye!	0.6667	1.6667	0.3333	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	3	It sucks that she trained all this time to be a pilot jsut to get killed.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	4	yeah no doubt, I hope they can figure out what went wrong.  was it the jets or lack of training?	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	5	Might be just something with the jets, it was just very unfortunate	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	6	Yes for sure, and I gathered she was very young too?	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	7	She seemed very young from the article, seemed like she just became a pilot not long ago. Overall, being on a plane is scary, for me at least. Just being in the air in general is scary.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
65	8	Yeah I will not do it at all, terrifying.  So she was very brave.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	150.0	24.0	64.0
65	9	Yeah! I honestly get nervous just flying on an airplane.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	150.0	17.0	564.0
66	0	Hi there - the cruelty of kids towards other kids can be truly horrifying	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	1	Agree the fact that adults don't educate or do anything more to stop this is even more horrifying.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	10	There should probably be school-wide programs to try to prevent all this in the first place. I wonder how clearly this issue is being addressed in US schools?	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	11	I don't think its being addressed here at all although who knows. The article says in France 90 percent of the kids have access to social media which is where all the bullying goes on. Can you imagine how many kids have access here .	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	12	It's scary to consider! Must be closer to 100% here.  I'm old enough that there was no social media when I was in school and I'm so freaking grateful for that!	1.3333	3.0	2.0	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	13	Yeah the worst that can happen back then was miniscule to now where hundreds of kids can bully a single child at one time through social media.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	14	Exactly. It would be scary as hell to be in school these days. Funny, I always think of this as a US problem, but I shouldn't be surprised that it's a major issue in Europe, too	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	15	yeah I assume every country with wide internet access has this problem.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	16	Hooray for technology!	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	17	What would you do if one of your kids were bullied?	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	18	You know, I'm not sure. I'm not a parent; beyond being furious, I want to say that I would get in touch with school officials and try to get all the parents involved.  I would give my kid the option to change schools or maybe be homeschooled....? What about you?	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	19	Same first thing is contact the other kids parents to see if they can talk to the other kid as I would not be able to do that. Second definitely contact the school and if all else fails the police but they would be my last resort. I'm not a parent but that is how I would do it. Changing schools for sure though.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	2	That is the truth! Where are the parents - not just of the kids being bullied, but of othe bullies themselves?f the	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	20	That's the thing -  we can get everyone involved, but that won't fix the issue for the bullied person. It's unfair, really	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	21	yeah they won't forget the scar as long as their alive which is terrible and I do not know how that can be fixed	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	22	Therapy, maybe. Lots and lots of therapy.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	23	You're right therapy does work sometimes.	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	24	If you can find a good therapist. But that's a whole other issue :) What is it that makes kids into bullies in the first place?	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	25	probably their parents at home not giving them enough attention	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	26	No doubt. Acting out their anger/frustration on other kids instead of their parents. *sigh*	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	27	dont know if they can be blamed though	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	28	No, I agree, they're still just kids. Parents need to step up	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	29	Its just a hard subject overall. I think we did 15 turns too. I enjoyed it. Bye.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	3	Parents are just not being parents from the looks of things	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	30	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	31	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	4	Sorry about that typo. Why do you think parents don't seem to be willing to be more engaged in their kids' lives? Are the adults too busy, they don't want to intrude, they just want to be buddies with their kids...	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	5	I think life keeps adults too busy to keep the food on the table to be honest...	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	6	I'm sure that's a big part of it. Maybe parents don't know how to deal with the online/social media world, either	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	7	What do you think the kids that cause the bullying should face?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
66	8	That's a great question. There should be some form of punishment but that must include some empathy training. What do you think?	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	138.0	27.0	65.0
66	9	I believe that is something they should do train them to do better since kids aren't really ready to think straight yet as I did some things I regret as a kid as well that I would no longer do as an adult.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	138.0	19.0	565.0
70	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	1	Bullying is a worldwide problem.   Reading that two young girls felt there was no reason to live was very sad to me.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	10	I was bullied as well but I had older brothers who would prevent it for the most part fortunately I didn't get it as bad as other kids including my friends. It happens in every school, every city, every country.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	11	It's alarming to the level it has gotten.   It weighs on your soul.   Middle school and high school are the worst in my opinion.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	12	yep middle school is the worst kids dont think straight at that age	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	13	Too many hormones kicking in.    Did bullying affect your opinion of yourself?	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	14	yeah I would not want to go to school sometimes what about you?	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	15	Same here.   I have had lifetime effects from a self-esteem point.   The old bullying adage of you are stupid, you are ugly, etc.  has lasting effects	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	16	do those childhood memories still haunt you today?	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	17	They do.   What about you?	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	18	Yeah sometimes I wish I could go back and stand up for myself	1.6667	3.6667	2.0	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	19	We didn't have the tools to do so younger.  Do overs are always better results.  It's been very nice chatting with you.    goodbye	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	2	what do you think can be about bullying	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	20	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	3	Social media is a huge component of teen suicides.   Parents are allowing their children to have access to things they are not mentally prepared for at alarming levels.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	4	agree parents are at fault in letting them on social media in the first place	2.0	3.0	1.3333	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	5	Exactly.   Many studies have already been done that kids shouldn't be on social media.   Their frontal cortex is not prepared for all they experience.  Once you see it, you can't unsee it.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	6	especially kids their brains arent fully developed yet and anything negative can have a big effect on them just reading it online	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	7	"It certainly can.  You always here the old ""I need to contact them.  They may need me.""   Well youngsters aren't by themselves.  They always have an adult.   Call the school office if you need something or vice versa.   It worked that way for 2010 years."	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
70	8	did you ever experience bullying as a child?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	138.0	19.0	69.0
70	9	I did.  My family lived on a farm.  The city kids always made fun of the country kids.   How parents allow their kids to be so mean - I will never understand.   Many parents need parenting classes before they have kids.   It's like I see nothing, I hear nothing mentality.   Such a disservice.   Were you bullied?	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	2	138.0	8.0	569.0
71	0	Tell me how you feel about this event?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	1	It's really saddening	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	10	This should be prevented from happening again	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	11	And I think the company should pay some sort of compensation	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	12	Yes i will agree with that	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	13	In saner climes, such companies would be sued and shut down eventually	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	14	I think that will not be a bad idea	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	15	What do you think should be done to prevent future occurrence of such accident	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	16	it was really a malfunction. it would be hard to proffer a solution now unless we know exactly the cause of the malfunction.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	17	Alright, but can you make a guess?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	18	I think a good proper check will definitely help	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	19	It will. Thanks for your time.	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	2	I feel so terrified	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	20	goodbye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	21	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	3	Me too	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	4	I feel so sad for the family	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	5	I can't even imagine the trauma that their families will go through	2.0	4.3333	4.3333	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	6	It was really too much	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	7	I wonder what must have caused the malfunction of the ride	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
71	8	I think some investigations should be done	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	3.0	5.0	70.0
71	9	Apparently	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	3.0	31.0	570.0
73	0	This is so sad and should not have happened these rides should be tested more.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	1	I agree, it was greed by the park.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	10	Yeah the girl that watched her mother die is going to need a lot of therapy I hope she gets it.	1.3333	4.3333	4.0	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	11	I agree, that one day changed her life forever.	1.6667	4.0	4.6667	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	12	Visitors said the ride had been plagued with mechanical glitches earlier that day the fact they kept it running shows who they are.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	13	Yeah they just wanted to make more money.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	14	Money really is the root of all evil.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	15	I agree	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	16	I hope justice is served here.	0.3333	3.0	2.6667	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	17	me too, but money really can not fit this	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	18	Yeah it can not at all this is just terrible. I think thats fifteen turns. Bye.	1.6667	2.0	4.0	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	19	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	2	Do you think the park should face any consequences	1.3333	1.3333	3.0	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	20	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	3	Yes, that is the only way they will change. What do you think?	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	4	I definitely think there should be a hefty fine.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	5	I feel bad for the girl who lost her mother.	2.0	4.3333	4.6667	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	6	The fact some of them were in holiday makes it depressing to hear.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	7	Yeah, You go to have fun and come home with somebody in your family dead.	1.6667	4.0	4.0	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
73	8	Yeah, leaving the stress of work and then dying on vacation is crazy.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	3.0	19.0	72.0
73	9	I'm happy that the two girls made it out alive.	0.0	4.0	4.3333	2	3.0	30.0	572.0
74	0	Hello. What happened to those people is really pathetic	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	1	Hello. It's beyond terrible. I can't even imagine going through something like that. I mean you're out to make lasting memories and instead lose your whole family. Terrible.	2.0	4.3333	4.0	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	10	As it stands, what happened probably was as a result of negligence. Accidents like these don't happen in Disneyland	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	11	I agree. Shoddy maintenance or failure to fix something due to expenses I'm sure probably was involved since there were many statements that the ride was having problems most of the day. I just think it's so sad that those people have to try and move forward after losing their loved ones in such a horrible way.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	12	Indeed	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	13	I also think its sad that so many people memories are ruined over this. I can't imagine all my happy summer fair memories and trips to amusement parks being tainted by something like this.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	14	It's really saddening. I wouldn't want to be in such situation	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	15	Me either. I also wonder why if the ride was having so many issues they didn't just shut it down. I'm not familiar with that park as I'm in the US but surely that wasn't the only ride. Why not just close it and then make sure its fixed for another day?	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	16	Greed! That's why. It was nice chatting with  you. Do you have a nice day	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	17	I'm sure greed did in fact have a part in it. I'd like to know more though. It's so easy to get caught up in the terrible accident part of the story and forget there are other sides to an issue.	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	18	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	19	Thanks for the chat. I enjoyed talking with you. bye	0.6667	2.0	0.3333	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	2	Indeed. I can only imagine the trauma the survivors will go through	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	3	I know. I've grown up going to fairs every summer and been to Disneyland and other amusment parks and you just never imagine that things like that can happen.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	4	I really don't like such places though because I fear things like that may happen	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	5	It's funny because you hear now and then that something like this can happen. Yet whenever I'd go. It would never even cross my mind. I guess it's funny how we don't like to imagine that kind of terrible incident happening to us directly.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	6	I understand. But nothing is impossible though	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	7	Oh, I know nothing is impossible. I just don't guess we like to imagine that they happen to us.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
74	8	That's true. By the way, I think the company should be sued	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	3.0	31.0	73.0
74	9	I'm sure they will be. I fear that is another problem with our society. We take every bad thing and want to see it as a way to make money. Not saying the company shouldn't be held accountable for their actions. But I wish we weren't always looking to make a buck off bad things and accidents.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	3.0	44.0	573.0
75	0	Wow, what did you think of this?!	1.0	2.6667	1.0	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	1	Very sad and very scary, what do you think?	2.0	4.3333	4.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	10	no, i do not either, definitely not.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	11	I know people die everyday but not all deaths are equal.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	12	yeah seriously, I mean my philosophy is if it can be prevented I'd like to take those measures.  I know some people have a different approach and that is fine but this is how I choose to live my life.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	13	You only get one for forever.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	14	yep, exactly.  maybe they should have better regulation of these theme park rides or somethiing, I don't know.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	15	Yeah, I agree with that	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	16	Like some sort of weekly checks.  It should not be a deadly situation.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	17	I think they do daily checks, but I think a death in your park should have big penalties	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	18	You are probably right, I know nothing about it.  but yeah, that's a good point.  huge fines.  I must be going, it was nice talking to you.  bye	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	19	You too! bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	2	YEs!  So heartbreaking and how traumatizing for everynoe involved	2.0	4.6667	4.0	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	3	That what I was thinking. Something that was suppose to be fun.	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	4	Yes, seriously.  Gosh and how painful for the adults who suffered, and omg the kids.  Even for the witnesses it would have been terrifying.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	5	It makes me think twice about going to places like that.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	6	I do not go to places like that bc I am a paranoid person and this is exactly what I fear.  Just this week a roller coaster plunged off the track and two people died	2.0	4.0	2.0	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	7	We are on the same page with that	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
75	8	it's just not worth it to me.  but regardless, it should be safe for these people who do choose to do it	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	3.0	24.0	74.0
75	9	I agree. My i don't let my kids get on local fair rides.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	3.0	30.0	574.0
76	0	I really am not sure how I feel about this article. I think that parents in this situation need to face some type of punishment.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	1	Why do you feel that way?	1.0	0.6667	1.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	10	"Right so the ""punishment"" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again."	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	11	I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity. Tragedies like this are required before any meaningful action is taken across the board.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	12	It is sad for sure. I hope I do not seem too uncaring about this scenario it just triggers anger rather than sympathy as this is something that could have been avoided though I can imagine the parents feel the guilt more than anybody else.	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	13	anger is a completely natural response to situations like this I was just picturing the parents sitting in the living room confident in the fact that their children were safe while one lay dead in the parking lot below	1.3333	4.0	3.0	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	14	Yea I can imagine that was a tough thing to experience. Sucks that their other little kid will never meet his brother.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	15	Yeah, so sympathy was my first response. Do you have children?	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	16	I do not have children but do have nieces and nephews. I am able to feel sympathy, anger and be critical at the same time though. Sympathy doesn't change the facts.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	17	Well, considering we don't have all the facts I think that's a pretty foolish statement.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	18	Fact 1- the window was left open with only a screen. Fact 2- the screen was not secured in place. Fact 3- The parents could not heard from the living room to the kids room. Those seem to be easily understood facts.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	19	Your second and third facts are assumptions. The screen could have been secure, but the full weight of a four year old child being pressed against it over an extended period of time could certainly dislodge it. The whole process could have been relatively silent as those details weren't included in the article, hence my statement about having all the facts. It seems your anger is causing you to attempt to establish things as fact that simply can't be substantiated. Thanks for chatting! bye	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	2	Because it is a case of negligence at the core.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	20	have a good one! bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.0	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	3	Because they left a window open and the toddler pushed through the screen? I know that jumping toward negligence is a common emotional reaction to situations like this, but I think that you're misplacing blame in this instance.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	4	Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	5	In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	6	If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	7	Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered. It's terrible to think of a dead child in any context.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
76	8	Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	2.0	75.0
76	9	I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	169.0	25.0	575.0
77	0	Tell me what you feel about the incident?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	1	I think that is horrible can you imagine what the parents are going through after this	2.0	3.6667	4.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	10	Yes, I think parents need to be more active and keep an eye on these young ones	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	11	Certainly do, it is best to prevent accidents from happening ahead of time by identifying threats	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	12	Yes. what else do you think can be done to prevent this?	1.0	0.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	13	I think that parents should make sure that all windows are locked securely	0.3333	0.6667	3.0	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	14	And even if they are not they should always keep an eye on their kids	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	15	Yes deffinately, I'm sure the parent is pretty upset with themself right now	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	16	I really feel so sad for the parents	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	17	They sell cheap window locks that can put on any window on Amazon	1.0	0.6667	3.3333	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	18	sure that will be a good thing to do	0.6667	1.0	2.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	19	I'm pretty sure they can be applied to any window, I recently bought some to go on the cabinets in the kitchen	0.6667	0.6667	2.0	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	2	I feel really sad about it	2.0	3.0	4.3333	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	20	I also think this safety measures should be advocated	0.3333	1.0	2.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	21	It really does make you question what they parents where doing when this happened	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	22	i wonder as well	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	23	I know children can be sneaky but I would imagine you can hear your kid trying to climb out of a window	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	24	I am always curious whenever they are silent	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	25	Exactly, so some of the blame deffinately is on the parent	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	26	Yes a larger part of it i must say	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	27	How should a problem like that be addressed? Should it be on the news to notify all parents of the dangers?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	28	I think the media should do more to create more awareness	0.3333	1.0	2.3333	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	29	Yes that's what I was saying but I doubt parents would watch a boring show about kids falling from windows	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	3	Yes it is terrible, it made me think about some of the windows in my house	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	30	oh yeah... I think we have had a great conversation....goodbye	0.3333	2.0	0.3333	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	31	Yes I enjoyed speaking with you goodbye	0.0	2.0	0.3333	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	4	Yes, especially when you still have young ones at home	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	5	I have a couple windows up stairs that I need to look at, I dont think my son can reach them but you kids can be very creative when they want something	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	6	Yes, it is really as if the first years of their lives they are always looking for ways to kill themselves	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	7	That poor baby was probably in so much pain before dying	2.0	4.0	4.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
77	8	I can only imagine that really	1.0	3.0	3.0	1	169.0	5.0	76.0
77	9	It probably happens more than we hear about it	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	169.0	10.0	576.0
78	0	hello, what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	1	Hi, I thought the article was dreadfully sad. I can't imagine being those parents.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	10	yea true. the parents really should have been more careful, i feel awful for them though	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	11	Me too. I know some people hate safety laws, but it seems like this one area should be a safety thing. I mean, for the owners of high rises to take reasonable precautions against people going out windows. If you think about it, it could also apply to an adult!	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	12	yes that is true. i hope they have learned from it	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	13	That's really what I meant about legal issue before - I mean, not for the parents but for the owners.	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	14	i agree with that	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	15	I am grateful though that the parents aren't being looked at with suspicion. It seems all too often that there might be something else going on.	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	16	yeah true im sure that would only add to their misery	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	17	If it was me, I'm not sure I'd be abe to live above ground level ever again	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	18	im going to end the chat now, it was nice talking to you, have a good day. goodbye	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	19	goodbye	1.0	0.3333	0.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	2	me either, they must feel awful	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	3	I do wonder though why limits on how far you can open a window in a high rise isn't a thing. The one time I lived in a high rise you couldn't open the windows more than a few inches.	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	4	yeah true i thought the same. or they will have bars to prevent it	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	5	Do you know of any child proofing things for windows? The only think I could think of would prevent the windows from being opened	1.0	0.6667	2.0	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	6	they will usually have steel bars or something like that in high rises	1.0	0.6667	2.0	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	7	True. I wonder if the parents will eventually feel moved to try and get bars installed. It sounds like the kind of situation where it could easily happen again	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
78	8	yeah i think i remember reading that they had another child	1.3333	0.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	7.0	77.0
78	9	I mean, it seems like it might be a potential legal issue - or osha or something. Then again, I'm also remembering the recent cruise where a baby/kid fell several stories out of a window	2.0	1.0	2.0	2	169.0	55.0	577.0
79	0	I feel bad about the little boy	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	1	It's horrible what happened to him	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	10	why do you think that?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	11	She was the one that put them to bed. She was supposed to check all windows properly before leaving the room	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	12	I agree a little, but the father was at home and odds are this is not the first time the window was open.	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	13	Either ways, what happened was really terrible. I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	14	me either, I hope others learn from this.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	15	I hope so too. What would you advise parents that live in storey buildings?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	16	most newer windows had child locks so the window only opens so much, older windows you should put a stick or stopper in them.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	17	Nice. I think that can curb future occurrence of such incident. It was nice chatting with you	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	18	you too, bye	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	2	How do you feel about the parents?	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	3	In as much as what happened was an accident according to the police investigations, I think the parents should be blamed	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	4	I think they should be blamed, but losing a child is a lot of punishment.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	5	Indeed	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	6	I worry too and always watch my children.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	7	You should. I can't take my eyes off them	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
79	8	I wonder what they were thinking?	1.3333	1.0	3.0	1	169.0	30.0	78.0
79	9	His mother holds most of the blame in this case	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	169.0	31.0	578.0
80	0	hey what are your thoughts on the article	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	1	It was so very sad.   Those poor parents.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	10	i know i would be traumatized for life	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	11	Exactly.  If I run up on a wreck with fatalities, it's devastating	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	12	i dont know how emergency responders do it	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	13	Agreed and what surgeons see.  God bless them all	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	14	yes thats why they get paid so much	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	15	and they should.   I do feel like the apartment owner is at fault though.  It won't bring the little boy back but it may help others	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	16	yeah to put more safety and education in play for others i agree	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	17	Exactly.   I have never seen a little one die.  (:	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	18	I would never want to how sad	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	19	agreed.  well it was nice chatting with you.   Have a good day goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	2	I now what a sad painful way to die	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	20	you two bye!	0.6667	2.0	0.3333	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	3	I doubt he felt anything.  Most of the time it is just quick.   Leaving a window opened for fresh air definitely was not intentional	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	4	thats true idk if that was me i would have monitored it more	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	5	It's always easy to see what should have been done.  Parents work, cook, clean, take care of kids, etc.   Possibly they could have seen whether it was easy to push out though.   Kids are climbers.  Mine certainly never stayed in their crib.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	6	wish the apartment had some kind of reinforcement on the windows for safety	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	7	Definitely.  As long as they have renters, they may clean the carpet and that's about it.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
80	8	that is so sad they should make laws	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	169.0	53.0	79.0
80	9	I know.  I felt for the people that were outside and found him.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	169.0	8.0	579.0
81	0	I felt like the article was a bit worriesome. What abotu you?	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	1	Worrisome how so?  I found it to be very tragic.  I keep thinking about the remaining family members like what if there was a wife/mother and possible siblings who lost a brother and a dad?	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	10	I think it'll take at least half a year before the feeling of shock leaves. But like you said, they'll prob never recover. Or at least never be the same.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	11	Yeah definitely it would be life altering/life ruining possibly to have something like that happen	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	12	That's why i always preach live life to it's fullest and show love to everyone. You never know what will happen.	1.0	2.6667	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	13	Yes that is a good thing to live by every day because you just never know.  I also prefer to avoid risky activities but that's just me.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	14	Same here. I don't do things like skiing or snowboarding even though all my friends love that.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	15	Yes I don't do those things either.  To me it's just not worth the possible risk and I'd rather my family members not do those things either.  Right now I can prevent my kids from doing dangerous things but I guess when they're older it will be out of my control.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	16	Definitely. I  undertand how my parents feel now when i was younger and did reckless things.	1.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	17	ME too!  I put mine through torture for sure.  Ugh.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	18	Well, it was nice talking to you. I hope that family recovers. :(	1.0	2.6667	1.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	19	You too, and I hope the same.  Have a great day	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	2	I guess that's what i meant too. It worries me to think about what the remaininig family members have to go through.	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	20	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	21	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	3	Yes exactly, same here.  It's seriously terrible.  And was certainly so unexpected too	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	4	I know someone who went through the same thing, their family was never the same. It's very sad.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	5	Yes that's certainly something you could never come back from.  My cousin lost her husband to a kayaking accident last year.  Just to lose two family members at once is just extra terrible.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	6	Wow, i feel bad for them. To lose someone you love unexpectedly, i can't even imagine.	2.0	4.0	4.6667	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	7	Yeah seriously.  I don't even like talking about it.	2.0	3.3333	4.6667	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
81	8	How long do you think it'll take for the family members to recover? or at least, not feel as much pain as they're feeling now	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	353.0	17.0	80.0
81	9	Yes good question.  I guess that would vary per person.  Some people may never recover, you know?  Certainly it would take at least six months or a year to begin to feel like you could function each day again.  I really don't know what do you think?	1.3333	2.0	4.0	2	353.0	24.0	580.0
83	0	It's a shame that a father-son outing had to end so tragically.	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	1	That was really a sad event	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	10	"I mean, here in the states we have a mass shooting every week or so; there are never many details, but tell me that headlines like ""12 dead, 8 wounded in mass shooting"" don't roll off your back after the last few years."	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	11	You are on point. Details matters as well	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	12	Details are what curry empathy among the listener, even something as trivial as mentioning that the child's parents had just divorced or that he had a mother at all would have made the story more relateable.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	13	That is true, But we should not deviate from the fact that, that was a tragic incident.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	14	I don't think it's a deviation to suggest how they might have added pathos to the story.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	15	What do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence?	1.3333	0.6667	0.6667	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	16	That's a tough one. National Parks are large and people take a risk every time they go into the woods. I suppose proactive education is probably the most feasible answer.	1.0	0.6667	2.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	17	I will agree with that	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	18	Well, thanks for chatting! bye	0.0	1.0	0.6667	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	19	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	2	Did they actually die on impact, or was the helicopter malfunctioning the reason why they didn't make it out?	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	3	I think it was because of the helicopter power failure	1.3333	1.0	2.3333	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	4	They must not have fallen very far if they survived the initial impact. Did the article even explain how they ended up falling from the trail?	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	5	No, Not sure	1.0	0.6667	1.3333	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	6	It's really hard to feel overly empathetic in this instance because of the lack of details.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	7	Details or No details. That's sad thing to happen to anyone	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
83	8	I'm not denying the tragedy of the circumstances, but the world at large has become inured to delineations of events like this.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	353.0	25.0	82.0
83	9	Sadly, that is true	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	353.0	5.0	582.0
85	0	The article was very sad. What did you think abotu it?	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	1	I thought it was sad, too.  There weren't many details though.  I wonder what happened for both of them to die.	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	10	Yeah, i try to stay away from things like hiking. lol	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	11	This story reminded me of my dog.  She tumbled over a cliff of sorts, fell into a river bed, and was never seen again.  Made me very sad.	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	12	I'm so sorry to hear that. That's why i always preach live life to the fullest and show love to your loved ones	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	13	Yes, that's a good philosophy.  We don't show enough love and appreciation to those we care about.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	14	Also living life to the fullest, never know what will happen.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	15	This is sort of why I wonder whether it was better or worse emotionally for them to be together.  Either they appreciated the companionship and comfort of having the other person there, or it was worse because they knew neither would get out, and perhaps one even caused the death of the other.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	16	That's true. Either way, it's scary to think about. What do you think happened though? Do you think they're both dead?	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	17	Yes, I think they're both dead.  I think they fell off a cliff or something.  Or there was a rock slide or something.  That'd be my guess, although I really don't know.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	18	A rockslide sounds about right. Are they sure they fell? What if they got eaten by an animal.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	19	I thought it said they fell, although maybe I'm misremembering, or assumed that incorrectly.  But yeah, it could be a lot of things.  Getting lost, animals.  I suppose they could have even gotten sick eating something, although they were just hiking so they probably wouldn't need to eat anything they found.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	2	Did they find the bodies yet? I thought i read that they are still looking. Either way, i'm pretty sure both passed away.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	20	Let's just hope something positive comes out of this although i doubt it. Well it was nice talking to you!	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	21	Yeah, that would be a minor miracle.  Anyway, nice talking to you, too.	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	22	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	23	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	3	I think they know where the bodies are but can't retrieve them.  That was my interpretation.  That seems sort of lonely, even though they're dead.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	4	I wonder what the mom is going through. It's terrible.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	5	Yes, I'm sure she's incredibly distraught.  I also wondered, was it better or worse that the father and son died together?	2.0	2.3333	4.6667	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	6	i think it's pretty bad. Or at least for the father. I'm sure he would have wanted his son to live and grow up to watch his mom	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	7	I'm sure.  I also wonder whether one of them did something that caused problems for them both.  Like, one slipped and then they both fell when the other tried to save the first.  That would be awful.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
85	8	Yeah you're right. There weren't much details about what happened. Though, i do hope they find their bones(assuming they passed away)	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	353.0	17.0	84.0
85	9	As sad as it is, hiking is dangerous.  Mother Nature can be brutal.  You always take risk when you go out like that.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	353.0	48.0	584.0
88	0	It's very depressing to know that suicide deaths among kids is on the rise.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	1	I find that very depressing and sad too.  What do you attribute it to?  The article didn't touch much on the causes.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	10	yeah even if you dont think theyd visit them its always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	11	yes mine will not, they think they are evil, but yes being safe rather than sorry is always a good thing	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	12	do you think some blame can be placed on the parents of kids that commit suicide?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	13	that's kinda hard to say.  I mean, I guess one could argue that the parents could have failed to do things to protect their children in some cases.  I can't imagine if my child were being bullied and just failing to act.  And parents that allow their children to be exposed to things they shouldn't be.  I really don't know, though.  You'd have to judge that on a case by case basis I think.  What do you think?	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	14	I agree it depends on the case.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	15	yes I mean you couldn't just say that as a blanket statement.  But if a parent disregarded signs of distress then they would seem partially responsible.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	16	a lot of parents unfortunately do disregard the signs	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	17	yeah that's terrible and seems like neglect	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	18	its a crime in my opinion	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	19	yes, maybe eventually the legal system will see it that way too	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	2	I'm thinking bullying by other kids that can be tough on kids that have never experienced it before.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	20	its the logical thing to do considering what the kids go through	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	21	Yes I agree it makes sense and a parent has a duty to protect.  Well I must unfortunately go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you have a nice day.  goodbye	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	22	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	3	Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking too.  I read a lot in the news about children who have committed suicide as a result of bullying, it's really heartbreaking.  IT seems so frequent.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	4	and with social media it only gets worse	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	5	yes social media is the major fuel to that fire in my opinion	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	6	yeah what was once one kid bullying another is now hundreds or even thousands joining in on it.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	7	yes and it follows them home, they can't escape it.  It's really sad.  We don't allow social media in our house, not for anyone.  It's not safe in my opinion.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
88	8	yeah its a good thing you can block them all out with a good router	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	304.0	19.0	87.0
88	9	yes that's true, my kids don't try to sneak and use it so that's not an issue at this point but it's good that's an option.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	304.0	24.0	587.0
89	0	It is quite alarming that suicides among young children have increased, but not at all surprising	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	1	It is very sad. I have some young cousins so it gets me worried.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	10	The date listed in the article is very telling. The suicide rates began to increase in 2007. This is around the time that social media prevalence increases as well	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	11	You got that right. I wonder if there will ever be some type of ban or limit on social media in the future.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	12	I am not sure. But something has to be done to address the negative impact that social media has on society	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	13	Do you know anyone that has been through this situation or osmething similar?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	14	No I do not know anyone who has committed suicide? Do you?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	15	No but i do have a friend that is always depressed and that can lead to something else in the future	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	16	Is your friend active on social media websites?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	17	Active like browsing other people. Not posting or anything though	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	18	Using the sites for browsing qualifies as activity. I think social media websites should be required to provide online counseling for their users. I think this would help ameliorate some of the problems	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	19	Thats a great idea, definitely would help. Well it was nice talking to you!	0.0	2.6667	2.0	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	2	Why do you worry about your cousins? What makes you think they may be at risk for suicide?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	20	It was nice talking with you too. Do you have any ideas on how to improve the impact of social media on suicides?	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	21	I would say a limit on social media like Instagarm. maybe it can close after a certain amount of minutes. It will prob never happen though, but just an idea.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	22	Thats a good idea! Maybe if there were someway to monitor the emotional state of the user and limit the activity based on that. What do you think?	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	23	Sounds good. Hope things will improve in the future. bye!	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	24	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	3	I would say because they are very introverted. Spend lots of time indoors and don't like socializing with others.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	4	That can be troubling. Do you think their behavior is out of the ordinary for children their age?	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	5	I would think it's because of bullying at school to be honest. I think that's what causes most suicides	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	6	That can be a factor. I believe there is a direct correlation between social media and suicide in general	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	7	I honestly think so as well. I think social media forces children and teens to think they have to be a certain way.	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
89	8	I agree. Increased social media use is correlated with many negatives, depression is one of them. Depression and suicide are also linked	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	304.0	35.0	88.0
89	9	Definitely. As well as anxiety if it gets too serious i would say.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	304.0	17.0	588.0
90	0	The suicide numbers are disconcerting, but I'm amazed at the improvement in the car accident death numbers.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	1	Same here, it is really sad	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	10	What I didn't relate to was when she said a teen might kill themselves because of a fight with their boyfriend.  I never remember having feelings nearly that volatile.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	11	It is sad..it all boils down to emotional intelligence. Many of these kids going into relationship aint matured enough	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	12	I think they also live so much of their lives, and relationships, online.  And there's something more powerful about that, as counterintuitive as it sounds.  it's like it exists inside you, so it's not diluted by anything, instead of existing in reality, outside of you.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	13	You have a solid point there. They dont get to discover the person who they really are...	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	14	I can't fathom what it must be like for a parent to lose a child through suicide.  Not only the obvious loss, but the incredible guilt that they must feel, rightly or wrongly.	2.0	3.3333	4.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	15	Yea..it is selfishness on the kid's part	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	16	Sure, although we're all guilty of that to various degrees.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	17	I wont like to be in that shoe...I really hope not to be	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	18	Yeah, that's probably got to be about as bad as it gets.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	19	Depression is also a major culprit...I heard it is more mental than emotional	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	2	I thought it was interesting that the suicide spike was in 2007, when I think the iPhone was introduced.  Not saying there's a direct causation there, but I don't think pervasive internet and social media has been good for children's (or anyone's) mental health.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	20	Yes, depression is definitely a large factor.  Too bad because it's something that's not treated simply.  Although we certainly try to throw a lot of drugs at this type of thing now.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	21	The drugs...I dont feel they really solve it. It is just to manage it. The pharmaceutical companies are all out for more profits	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	22	Yes, I think it's not a great situation.  Anyway, it was good talking to you.  I'm going to sign off here.  bye	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	23	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	3	Yea, with internet, we tend to compare our self with others. Personally, I see comparison as a form of motivation though, some people however get pressurized with it.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	4	Yes, I think you're exactly right about the comparison part.  We're exposed to so many images to compare ourselves to.  Exponentially more than we used to be.  That weighs heavily on many.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	5	also, I feel this generation is weaker..lol	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	6	I think so, too, although I think that's partly a function of the environment they're growing up in.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	7	Yeah...more attention should be paid to emotional intelligence and maturity.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
90	8	"I have to admit that I laughed at the article when the expert said that it's not normal to say things like, ""I wish I could just go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that every day for 30 years."	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	304.0	48.0	89.0
90	9	Lol..I say that a lot too. That is what stress can cause	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	304.0	40.0	589.0
91	0	Hearing news stories like this makes me feel physically ill.	2.0	5.0	4.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	1	It was really sad	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	10	Adequate punishment is rarely given in our own armed forces. Frankly, I doubt there will be any justice for the lives that have been forever changed by these events.	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	11	This is really sad to hear	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	12	It's really difficult for me to imagine. Humans are resilient creatures, but the kinds of things that are being allowed to happen at this stage of social progress makes me realize just how lost we are as a species.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	13	What do you think can be done to prevent this from reoccurring?	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	14	There are things that can be done, but the likelihood is slim. I think that the United Nations should take up a banner for all refugees. There are people being displaced all over the world and the world is consistently shrugging its shoulders when confronted with that reality. I think they should at least be contributing to relief and temporary placement efforts in affected areas. More people should be volunteering to help.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	15	I totally agree with you	0.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	16	The problem is that humans only have so much empathy to give and this sort of situation seems to roll from one crisis to another with no end in sight.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	17	I really hope it will not have really long term bad effect on the victim	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	18	I think that is almost assured. Well, it was nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	19	My pleasure....bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	2	Seeing religion used to excuse actions like this really puts dogma in perspective.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	3	It is really sad that this is happening in the society	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	4	I think this is more an example of what happens when there is no social fabric to support people who are easily exploited.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	5	I agree with you	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	6	Do you think that anything can be done to prevent such things in situations like this? Or, is it just a sorrowful truth about human nature?	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	7	I think Governments are doing all they can and the military. But i doubt if there will ever be permanent solution	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
91	8	I think the military is part of the problem in this instance. These are people who have been displaced to refugee camps by violence.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	233.0	25.0	90.0
91	9	True, i think adequate punishment should be given	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	233.0	5.0	590.0
95	0	What a terrible situation those people are in. I can't even begin to imagine what it's like.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	1	Same here. To be treated like that by people who are in a leadership position. Using their power to abuse women. It's horrifying	2.0	3.6667	4.6667	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	10	Maybe. One can hope that eventually the bad officials will be replaced with the moral leaders eventually.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	11	I hope so. I feel like they need to do something for these women. Provide counseling and medical care free of charge.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	12	Counseling at least. PTSD would be probable from just the terror group experiences and then you have this added on top of those experiences.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	13	Oh yeah absolutely. They will need extensive therepy and for the ones that got pregnant medical care will be necessary as well	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	14	It would be super hard to raise a kid in that instance. You're already in a refuge camp barely able to take care of yourself and not you have to take care of another life.	2.0	3.0	4.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	15	I know. I have to hand it to the women that do it.  I don't think I could. After going thru all that I just don't know if I could raise a child on top of it in that situation.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	16	I have thought about situations related to this and if I was a woman I would seriously think about adoption. Can imagine the decision in the moment would be a lot harder though.	2.0	2.6667	4.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	17	It would be. To hand over your child to someone else has to be the most painful thing ever. I think I'd become very bitter	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	18	I think the only way I could really give my kid up is if I saw the chance to give them an amazing life whereas the life with me would be all hardship.	1.6667	2.6667	4.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	19	yeah. you always want better for your kid and I think giving them up to someone else would be the best option even though it hurts. So sad. My heart just breaks for these woman.	2.0	3.3333	5.0	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	2	I wonder if any of the workers who performed these acts have faces reprimands yet.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	20	In my opinion more aid should be sent to these areas rather than say Israel, a country that's already prosperous.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	21	I agree. These people need so much more help then some other countries we're helping need. I'd much prefer to see my tax dollars going to help people like these woman	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	22	"I am almost willing to say I'd support troops being sent in this situation. People speak so loud about the ""war on terror"" but you rarely hear about this"	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	23	You don't! You never hear about things like this. People are so focused on the wrong things. Not that other countries don't need help and aid but I don't think some like you said Israel are as much in need as these people.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	24	I think the helpless feeling is kind of why I avoid really looking into these situations. I wish our aid could be given to the places that people want rather than where the top officials want.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	25	I agree. I wish we could choose. I mean I guess I could contribute to a charity that might send money there. But I also get iffy on charities and whether or not my money actually goes where its supposed to.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	26	Exactly my reason for not giving to the big charities. I would be willing to give money to a company that produces anti-rape devices though. I think they could help these women	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	27	Yes now thats something I could get behind and support. These women need them more then anyone	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	28	It would add fear to the rapists as well. You never know who is wearing one! I think that's about all of my thoughts on this article though.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	29	same here its been great talking to you!	0.0	2.3333	0.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	3	Probably not.They'll probably just get a slap on the wrist and go on their way	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	30	you as well, enjoyable conversation partner. bye	0.3333	2.0	0.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	31	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	4	Hard to think of a punishment that would be harsh enough. I don't think people like that can be rehabilitated.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	5	I agree. They just think they are above everyone and nothing bad can happen to them. It's so messed up.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	6	I do not know much about the terror group that was talked about. Do you	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	7	No I'm not familiar with them at all. I guess I should pay more attention to whats going on in the world.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
95	8	I try to avoid some of the news. Stores like this really impact my emotions a lot. It would be hard for me to be around the people that performed these crimes.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	233.0	2.0	94.0
95	9	Same here. I couldn't do it. I'm not a violent person but I'm not sure what I would do if I were left alone with one of them. Death is too good for them. The state governor does sound like he wants to help though. Maybe he'll get something done?	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	233.0	32.0	594.0
97	0	Hello...it is really sad	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	57.0	40.0	96.0
97	1	Yeah why are they even allowed to do this.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	57.0	19.0	596.0
97	10	Exactly. They have their intelligence too	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	57.0	40.0	96.0

97	14	lol...i wont make that hasty conclusion	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	1	57.0	40.0	96.0
97	15	i mean its understandable when you see these kinds of things happen	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	57.0	19.0	596.0
97	16	Yea. it is. Can we end the chat now?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	57.0	40.0	96.0

97	4	Yea. I find that pacifying to an extent. I dont like the idea of keeping animals in captivity	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	57.0	40.0	96.0
97	5	There should be stricter rules around the world for this kinda stuff.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	57.0	19.0	596.0
97	6	Exactly...if you can offer more than mother nature, dont keep them at all	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	57.0	40.0	96.0
97	7	yeah man i dont know regulates the importing of animals but they need to be replaced	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	57.0	19.0	596.0
97	8	It really does. Most of these caged animals dont get to meet their families before they die	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	57.0	40.0	96.0
97	9	and most caged animals are smarter than we think and have feelings/emotions like we do.	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	2	57.0	19.0	596.0
98	0	What do you think about this problem animals are facing?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	1	selfishness and wickeness of humans	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	10	I also think animals should be allow to thrive at there natural habitats	0.0	2.3333	3.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	11	Exactly my point	0.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	12	That will really help a lot	0.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	13	Well, on a light mood. I hope the animals wont one day decide to figh us back	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	14	I do not see that happening anyways	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	15	I was just kidding	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	16	HAHA............I just we give the animals more respect	0.0	2.6667	1.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	17	Yeah, we really should.	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	18	I hope reasonable solution will be proffered soon............It has been great chatting with you...goodbye	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	19	bye	0.6667	0.3333	0.6667	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	2	How do you feel about the situation?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	3	I feel so terrible about it	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	4	I feel the same, it is really sad	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	5	What do you think can be done about it?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	6	I think more money should be allocated for zoos	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	7	Good. I think animal captivity should be totally abolished	0.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
98	8	Yes, that will go a long way too	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	57.0	5.0	97.0
98	9	And strict monitoring should be on also..there should be polices that discourage confinement of animals. Reserves is much more better	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	57.0	40.0	597.0
99	0	So, how do you feel about this article?	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	1	let us talk about your feelings, how do you feel?	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	10	The good news is that the animals that were rescued were able to be successfully rehabilitated.	0.0	2.6667	3.0	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	11	Exactly ..i feel so happy with that	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	12	It's hard to know what a person can do to support more missions like this. Especially since the organization responsible for the logistics is based in Germany I think? I guess the only thing you can do is donate money, but that is such a detached and mirthless way to support a worthy cause.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	13	Yes. the best is money. Can we end the chat now?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	14	We need three more turns, actually.	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	15	Oooh. alright then. Are you willing to help any organization with donation?	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	16	Definitely, I'd just have to do some research to find out where my money would be best spent. You?	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	17	I guess I would do the same	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	18	Well, thanks for chatting! bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.3333	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	2	I think we're both supposed to share, but I'll start us off. I think that it is shameful that management attempted to blame armed conflict for the sordid conditions. I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place. Noble animals deserve respect and no matter how well maintained a zoo may be they are still imprisoning living creatures.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	3	Exactly...we shouldt even have zoos in the first place. The worst we should have is reserves. It is so sad we confine animals	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	4	Not only were the animals starved to death, but their bodies were stuffed and mounted under the guise of posterity for a conflict that minimally affected the aggressor in the first place. I'm so glad that there are organizations out there keeping tabs on this kind of cruelty.	1.3333	4.0	3.6667	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	5	It is such a relief. There should be more policies to discourage such acts	0.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	6	I think that people involved in the Israel/Palestine conflict could care less about the lives of animals when their own lives (predominately Palestinians) are at risk. You were right when you said that zoos shouldn't be built in the first place, especially in war ridden areas.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	7	Yes, No one wil have the time to look after them. There is hierarchy in human needs	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
99	8	It's not like going to a zoo like that would be a leisurely activity in the first place. Who would delight in watching as animals starve to death?	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	57.0	25.0	98.0
99	9	No one..I know I wont for sure. I cant stand such sight	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	57.0	40.0	598.0
100	0	those poor animals. How do you feel about zoos in general?	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	1	I am not a supporter of zoos or circuses.   Wild animals were not met to be captured and put in a small area so humans can take pictures	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	10	thankfully there are people in the world like the people who rescued the animals	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	11	It is a blessing - I always wonder who people that do it know where it is taking place - dolphins, elephants, whales, etc.   People abuse all over the world but there are folks somewhere that try to help	0.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	12	theyre such rare people and it makes me reflect on myself to pay more attention to the world around me.	0.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	13	We all get caught up in working, cooking, cleaning, taking kids everywhere, and getting some sleep - it's very hard.  You almost have to carve out a time everyday whether early morning or before you go to bed to get caught up	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	14	yes it is very easy to forget how big this world is sometimes	1.3333	1.0	2.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	15	And even animals like horses are mistreated - starved because they do not have money for hay.   Please sell - don't let them just die	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	16	that reminds me of that racetrack in california that has put down many horses they closed it down to investigate and only 2 days after reopening it they put down another horse.	2.0	1.6667	3.0	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	17	what in the world is happening there?  What is wrong with their track that 30+ horses have died	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	18	I cannot believe they haven't been permanently shutdown! this is so obvious you'd think action would be taken.	2.0	4.3333	3.0	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	19	you would think there's a governing agency that would look out for the horses.  Minimal shutdown and $ became more important	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	2	i totally agree. i refuse to go to the zoo. it makes me so sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	20	the sad reality of rich people doing whatever they want because  the will never face consequences	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	21	It never changes.  It was nice chatting about this sad article and the other items that were relative.  Many blessings to you and yours.  goodbye	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	22	goodbye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	3	"It seems every day you pick up a newspaper or see it on TV where another animal was starved or not taken care of in zoos and circuses.   All for the $.  I live in Colorado and there's a wildlife viewing area.   There are 6,000 acres and animals roam freely.   I ""sort"" of think that's okay but you are still taking them out of their natural habitat."	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	4	wow that is insane. it's sad when a wild animal attacks a person they get put down even though it was the humans fault.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	5	Oh my!  I could talk for days.  I live in the mountains.   There are bears, mountain lions, foxes, elk, bison, and deer to name a few.  They freely roam through our downtown, on the highways, etc. and we allow them to be wild.   We then have people come in from everywhere that no nothing about wildlife and provoke the animals for photos are whatever.  The animal charges, hurts the individual and then Department of WIldlife has to put it down (:	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	6	aww that breaks my heart! where I live we have a bunch of deer. I love going outside the morning after it snows to see all the deer tracks. It makes me so sad to think that people put down these animals when they really don't do anything wrong.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	7	I know.  There are lots of protests going on here about not doing that - we will see.   This article we read was crazy even to think about opening a new zoo there.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
100	8	yes, it is so sad. all for entertainment with no care about the animals wellbeing. I do not understand how someone can sleep at night knowing they did that.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	57.0	16.0	99.0
100	9	Me either and why they would think this zoo was going to be anything different is beyond me.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	57.0	8.0	599.0
102	0	Isn't this sad? I feel so terrible for everyone involved. Especially the woman who lost her two month old.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	1	I was close to tears reading the article	2.0	4.6667	4.6667	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	10	If there wasnt I could see a lawsuit forming	1.6667	1.0	2.0	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	11	I would support that as well. That would be negligent on the part of the ship owner	1.6667	1.6667	3.3333	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	12	I'm sure people will sue regardless it sounds like there was something wrong with the ship	1.6667	1.0	2.6667	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	13	what do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	14	I'm not sure. Maybe more regulations about ship safety and checking things more and making sure its up to code?	1.3333	0.6667	2.3333	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	15	Or also providing a sure escape measures in cases of shipwrecks.	1.3333	0.6667	3.0	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	16	and lifejackets and boats if none were provided I can't remember if the article stated anything about that	1.3333	1.0	2.0	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	17	Not sure as well	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	18	I also feel for the ones who survived. They will need help with post traumatic stress as well	1.6667	2.3333	4.0	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	19	Yes, so as to get over the trauma	1.3333	1.3333	3.6667	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	2	It was definitely a hard article to read. News stories don't get me much unless they're involving children and especially children dying.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	20	yeah I can't imagine what they will be feeling for years to come	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	21	Not sure they will be able to get off their minds	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	22	I wouldn't be able too. It was great talking with you! bye	0.6667	2.6667	3.6667	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	23	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	3	Their were lots of young ones involved which makes it more terrifying	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	4	I know. I just can't imagine the fear they were feeling. Like I know the adults and everyone had to be terrified my heart goes especially to the kids.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	5	Me too, really sad situation	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	6	I'm always surprised when I hear about shipwrecks because I always think that the technology should be there o help prevent this stuff	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	7	I thought things like life jacket should be used and prevents deaths	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
102	8	I wonder if there wasn't any on board	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	67.0	32.0	101.0
102	9	We can only imagine...sigh	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	67.0	5.0	601.0
103	0	It makes me sad that people have to risk their life to find a better life.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	1	I tell you...i cant help the tears	2.0	4.0	4.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	10	If they had the money to fly, odds are they would not be leaving.	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	11	True that, you have a point	0.6667	0.3333	1.0	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	12	I do not think mothers risk their children if they had better options.	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	13	That is very correct. Many of they left as a result of unrest in their countries.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	14	It reminds me of what is going on in the US.	1.6667	1.0	2.0	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	15	The border cases?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	16	People just searching for a better life for their family.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	17	We should be grateful for what we have	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	18	I agree	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	19	I feel there should be a global move for a more peaceful world. When the global security is given the needed attention, less people will embark on such odyssey.	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	2	all those people dead:(	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	20	Your right and I believe it could be done.	0.0	1.0	2.3333	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	21	exactly. can we end the chat now?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	22	yes, bye	1.0	0.3333	0.3333	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	23	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	3	It is so sad. It was really avoidable	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	4	you do think the people can be helped?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	5	Yes, by staying in their country	0.6667	0.6667	1.6667	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	6	why? is not human history to spread out and move around?	1.3333	0.6667	2.0	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	7	It is, but there are safer routes	1.0	0.6667	2.3333	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
103	8	where? I think the people are doing the best they can.	0.3333	0.6667	3.3333	1	67.0	30.0	102.0
103	9	They could have flown	1.0	0.3333	1.6667	2	67.0	40.0	602.0
105	0	How do you feel about these people being displaced by extreme violence and perishing despite the fact that they made it out alive?	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	1	it is horrifying to make it that far and just die	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	10	Especially considering that a lot of these refugees are highly educated and capable of more than just manual labor.	0.0	1.6667	3.0	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	11	Yes this is true they could utilize them to advance there own society	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	12	Humanity always fairs better with cooperation, it's just sickening to imagine so much potential drowning in the ocean due to fear and indifference.	2.0	4.3333	3.0	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	13	Yes not much understanding and compassion for those poeple it is sad	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	14	I can understand the E.U.'s position though since the U.S. and Russian Federation have been the major players in both the Lybian and Syrian conflicts.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	15	True they would want to stay neutral and not really get involved or take sides	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	16	That and it isn't really their responsibility to deal with the fallout.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	17	but as a global citizen seems like everyone should help others or atleast try	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	18	Definitely, well thanks for chatting! bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	19	you two bye!	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	2	And the article mentioned that the E.U. was still more focused on preventing these people from reaching their shores than protection and integration.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	3	yes it is crazy there should be more aid to thm with human life at risk	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	4	How do you think they rationalize this kind of response to such a crisis?	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	5	probably like here that they dont know these people and dont want them coming in the country	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	6	Do you think that immigration and cultural diversity is ultimately a positive or negative influence on an economy?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	7	it can go both ways. I think illigal immigration is bad, not nowing the people coming in. But diversity is great	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
105	8	This specific circumstance would be asylum seekers, meaning they are literally fleeing their country to preserve their lives. I think that intake and acclimation centers would come at a hefty cost, but the contributions of asylum seekers would pretty rapidly outweigh any initial expenditure.	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	67.0	25.0	104.0
105	9	That is true it could be a greatinvestment as these people would be gratefulto live and work there	0.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	67.0	53.0	604.0
107	0	So, how did you respond to the article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	1	I think it's so terrible and horribly sad. Just another reminder of the damage we are continuing to do to the environment and the earth.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	10	Considering the fact that diamonds can now be convincingly replicated in laboratories, I can't see why the future might not unveil a sort of alchemical equivalent of changing abundant materials into formerly rare materials.	0.3333	0.6667	2.0	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	11	That would be a nice thought. It's going to take some major changes from everyone on earth to make a difference. I hope that we wake up to that and start now. It can't be done overnight and we need to start somewhere.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	12	The pessimist in me often entertains the thought that we have passed a point of no return when it comes to our environment. I believe that a low energy future will be visited upon humanity by force, not by choice.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	13	I am afraid that for a lot of things you might be right. I'd hope we could make the change because it's the right thing to do. However, I fear that for a lot of things it's going to come down to we have no other choice. Sad to think, but people don't often change unless forced to.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	14	Change is scary. People are afraid of what they don't understand and that is why human society has had no long lasting fundamental shifts in centuries. Our only hope is that our past won't be forgotten once we get a chance to start over.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	15	I'd like to hope that we'd learn from our mistakes, but it seems we only learn the lesson for so long and then we backslide. I think it's not even so much fearing the change as the fact that so many people fear for their money and industry that makes money now are things we need to move away from.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	16	Do you feel that free market capitalism is a viable ideology moving forward?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	17	"I think it would be if it was a true free market system. But too often we say it's free market and yet we bail out companies because they are ""too big to fail"" but in a true free market if you fail you fail."	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	18	Hey, I really enjoyed our chat! Have a good one! bye	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	19	Thanks for chatting. goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	2	Are you able to empathize with the people who are responsible for the spill and the subsequent clean up? Meaning, can you picture yourself being so concerned with money that you are effectively willing to destroy people's livelihoods?	1.3333	1.0	2.6667	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	3	I can understanding needing and wanting money and doing things you don't like to get it. But I can't imagine getting money in such a way that I'd hurt so many other people in the process and ruin an entire river. I can't imagine being that kind of person.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	4	I think there's a sociopathic dehumanization that occurs in people like that. Like, the people potentially affected are seen as so far beneath them that they can't effectively relate to their circumstances.	1.6667	1.0	3.0	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	5	I don't know if they even really think about other people at all. I mean, I feel that someone so focused on their own wealth above all else doesn't even take the time to consider other people in their plans at all. I don't think they even care as long as they are obtaining their goals.	1.6667	2.0	3.6667	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	6	I think you are probably correct. I wish it would have specified what kind of mine it was. We can't keep raping the earth for corporate gain.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	7	No we can't. I don't think it really even matters what kind of mine it was. There isn't anything in the earth worth damaging an entire river and disrupting so many people's lives.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
107	8	What would you consider an alternative to these destructive practices?	1.0	0.6667	2.0	1	134.0	25.0	106.0
107	9	Well altneratives really depend on what type of mine it was. Basically for coal stop using fossils fuels. We have the ability to use wind, solar and water and we need to focus more on that. For minerals and gold and such, we need to figure out new manufacturing processes or start limiting the desire for those types of things so that mining isn't worth it.	1.3333	0.6667	2.0	2	134.0	44.0	606.0
108	0	This is a depressing thing that happened	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	1	It is. I can't imagine having water that is so polluted like that.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	10	some people gathered by an aquifer in the city  and filled up plastid jugs for family so that was good	1.5	2.3333	1.6667	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	11	yeah at least they got some clean water. That must have been a blessing	0.0	2.6667	3.0	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	12	yeah I can only imagine the taste after drinking all that dirty water	1.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	13	I wonder if they have plenty to eat other then fish	1.0	1.3333	3.0	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	14	probably not	1.5	0.6667	1.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	15	ugh I'm thankful I've never had to encounter things lke this	0.0	3.0	2.3333	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	16	It probably is a good thing we were born here.	0.5	2.3333	2.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	17	yeah reading stuff like this makes me even more grateful to live here	0.5	3.3333	2.0	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	18	Hopefully things get better around the world.	0.5	2.6667	2.6667	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	19	yes I agree. Let's hope things improve	0.5	2.3333	2.6667	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	2	I don't know if I wouldnt just not drink water at all in those conditions.	2.0	1.6667	3.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	20	Yeah at least they are taking steps towards it	0.5	1.3333	2.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	21	True! Well, its been great talking to you! have a good one. bye	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	22	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	23	7	1.0	0.0	0.3333	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	24	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	3	I don't think I would. I wouldn't be able to think about anything but mud. I don't think I'd mind giving up the fish either.	1.5	2.0	4.0	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	4	I would definitely starve myself in those conditions.	1.5	2.3333	2.3333	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	5	At least they're getting some compensation	0.5	1.3333	2.6667	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	6	true but is it enough	1.5	1.3333	2.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	7	Thats what I was wondering. $400 a month plus $80 for each dependent sounds like a lot but I don't know the cost of living there	1.5	2.0	2.6667	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
108	8	youre right the cost of living is probably lower there than in the usa	0.5	1.0	2.0	1	134.0	19.0	107.0
108	9	It sounds like the people down near the river were the most affected and getting the compensation and that sounds like a poor area to me. I could be wrong but that money could go a long way.	1.5	1.3333	2.3333	2	134.0	32.0	607.0
109	0	Hello there..	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	1	hello, that was really tough to read, hearing about how many people are financially impacted by that mud flood	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	10	it is so sad and terrible	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	11	I'm surprised more people are causing a bigger stir, they certainly have a right to be upset	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	12	I would be upset too...\	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	13	do you think you would stay and try to make your grievances known in that situation or would you try to move somewhere better?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	14	Personally, i would move. I am sure most people would love to move too, but where is the resources?	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	15	yes, plus all of the pain involved in moving in general and uprooting to go somewhere else	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	16	Starting all over! they might not even be welcome in the new location	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	17	that would really be awful. having a choice being staying somewhere awful, or moving to a place where people treat you worse	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	18	yeaa... guess we can say our bye	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	19	good talking to you. I hope it works out for the people affected. bye.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	2	It is so sad...I wish it was averted	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	3	its beyond a year later, and it doesn't seem like any normalcy has returned	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	4	Yes, the aftermath is still there. It might take some five years	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	5	if at all. I think there needs to be more of a restoration or cleanup effort.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	6	Exactly. I dont think that is in place yet	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	7	they have tried some minor things, like trying to replant the river banks, but it sounded ineffective and sloppy	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
109	8	Tree planting will help. I just hope they are deeply rooted. They should build artificial embankments also	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	134.0	40.0	108.0
109	9	yeah, the damages the company paid to the people also seem really small compared to what they are losing out on	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	134.0	11.0	608.0
110	0	hey what did you think of the article	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	1	hey I thought this was sad!  Having safe water is kinda an assumption here, it's hard to imagin how they feel.  What did you think?	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	10	it reminds me of the flint water crisis its just never ending	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	11	yes meanwhile the people suffer	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	12	and the government is do very little to correct the actions	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	13	no i doubt they will do anything	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	14	true they probably dont have the money to do much	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	15	no I doubt it, so the whole thing is just a tragedy	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	16	wonder what they will do for food and water now	1.3333	1.6667	3.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	17	I do not know, I guess wait on aid and deal with what they have?	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	18	the poor fish two died so slowly	2.0	3.0	4.3333	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	19	yeah seriously!  not just people.  well I gotta go, nice talking to you!  bye	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	2	i knowits like there life line was just cut off its so sad	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	20	great bye!	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	3	yeah and they are totally helpless	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	4	more aid and news coverage should be on this	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	5	yeah seriously to try to get these people the help they need.  something needs to be done	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	6	yes i fear so many will die without basic things like food and water	1.6667	3.0	4.0	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	7	yes, I agree.  families and children.  I can't imagine not having such basic needs.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
110	8	and there so use to it for generations fishing and making income so sad	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	1	134.0	53.0	109.0
110	9	yeah it really is sad.  i guess that is the life they know	1.6667	2.0	4.0	2	134.0	24.0	609.0
111	0	This conflict is a mess but I can't pretend like I really care.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	1	I care because it involves human life	1.3333	3.0	3.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	10	"Sure, I understand that.  But that's sort of my point.  I'm going to look out for my interests.  You're going to look out for yours.  I'm not going to look for trouble.  But if trouble finds me, whoa nelly, look out.  Why should I play by a set of ""feel good"" rules and harm myself in the process."	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	11	Without rules and with today's technology we will destroy each other.	2.0	2.0	0.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	12	So give me your perspective on Yemen.  How do you think that problem should be dealt with?  Keep fighting the Houtis, or concede and allow them to take over the country and government they've overthrown (with Iran's backing).	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	13	To be honest, I would like them fight and only give aid to the citizens.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	14	So just let the old regime and the Houthi rebels fight, and whoever wins gets to control the country?  While the rest of the world stays out of it except for aid?	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	15	Look at the US involvement in the middle east. Iraq is worst and Libya is now a hell hole.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	16	Yeah, I'm not arguing with what you said (although I personally don't agree).  I'm just trying to understand.  Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region?	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	17	We do not live over there, We can not say why they are fighting. We only get news reported to us. I do not think Iran can do any major damage to the US.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	18	I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	19	By your own logic, Israel if full of coach roaches too, (I do not agree) So why care what happens to them?	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	2	Sure, I understand that.  But people are about as valuable as cockroaches from a certain perspective.  And these people are about cockroaches from any perspective.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	20	Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst.	2.0	3.3333	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	21	I agree, but we are not messing with Russia or China if we really wanted to go after the bad guys.	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	22	We should do more with them, I think.  Not a hot war, where the ramifications are too great though.  See, I'm realistic too.  Anyway, interesting chat.  Thanks.  bye	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	23	You too, bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	3	That is a bad way of looking at things.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	4	"I'd say it's just a certain perspective.  Besides, I'm realistic about war.  There's going to be collateral damage.  If you fight in a war you should fight to win, and that means some ""innocents"" getting killed."	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	5	So you believe there should be no rules in war?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	6	Pretty much.  I mean, there are considerations to be made.  Like, if we violate the Geneva Convention it all but assures there will be ramifications for our troops.  But war is life and death.  I believe that if you aren't willing to fight in a way that MOST protects your own troops and your own nation, then you shouldn't fight at all.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	7	so your okay with 911, because they believed they were at war with the US.	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
111	8	If I were one of them I'd be okay with it.  From an objective perspective I don't think there's any authority that should prevent someone from doing that if that's what they think is right.  But obviously I don't agree with it because it affected my home country.  I understand your point but it really doesn't change anything I've said.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	45.0	48.0	110.0
111	9	I would do anything to protect my family, but I do not  go looking for trouble. I'm glad you can see it from an objective point of view because most can not.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	45.0	30.0	610.0
112	0	But really, can we just stop all the wars?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	1	for real that is the truth	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	10	I really wish I can do more	1.0	3.0	2.3333	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	11	Yeah unfortunately our hands are tied here	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	12	It is for real. I just hope the countries can come together	0.6667	1.0	2.6667	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	13	our country should help	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	14	yes, we are the bigger brother	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	15	we are the world police lol	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	16	hahhah..that is so true. Guess we can exchnage our bye	0.3333	0.6667	2.3333	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	17	bye	1.0	0.3333	1.0	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	2	It is the selfishness of man that keep hurting humanity.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	3	im a man and all but do you think this would happen if females ran the world ?	1.0	1.0	2.6667	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	4	Countries will be jealous of each other...lol	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	5	Thats true I didn't think of that one.	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	6	lol..That is on a lighter note.	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	7	yeah you just have to pray for victims of war	1.0	2.0	4.0	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
112	8	Exactly..that is the best we can do	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	45.0	40.0	111.0
112	9	unfortunately thats enough for the families of the victims	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	45.0	19.0	611.0
113	0	What do you feel about the incident?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	1	I think it's terrible that it's killing so many people.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	10	I think there should be a way around that	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	11	There should be, but what is the way?	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	12	The expert should be able to give reasonable answer	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	13	Who is the expert?	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	14	All the brains behind the air drops	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	15	That makes sense.	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	16	Oh yes	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	17	Do you feel bad for the families? It's terrible	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	18	Definitely, I hope they get deserved comfort	1.3333	2.6667	4.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	19	I hope they get some type of help in the form of money.	0.6667	2.0	3.6667	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	2	I feel so sad about it	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	20	Yes as compensation probably	0.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	21	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	22	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	3	It sucks because there are so many innocent people getting killed.	2.0	3.0	4.6667	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	4	This troubles me a lot	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	5	What do you think we can do about it?	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	6	I think we need to understand the reason why that happened first?	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	7	I think it's just relations. I mean, what do you think we can do to stop the killing of the air airdrops on innocent ppls	1.6667	1.6667	3.3333	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
113	8	I think they should always be sure of the target they are hitting?	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	45.0	5.0	112.0
113	9	But how can you, it's a bomb	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	45.0	17.0	612.0
114	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	1	I think it's disgusting that the majority of the casualties in this particular conflict are civilians.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	10	yes exactly, thats what i was implying	1.3333	0.6667	1.6667	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	11	I was just agreeing. What do you think we can do as passive observers to help the people being affected?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	12	sadly i dont think there is anything we can do other than just send them aid	2.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	13	I agree, but especially in Yemen that aid is being diverted and used by occupying forces and the people are starving.	2.0	1.6667	3.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	14	thats why i feel like theres really nothing the average person can do	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	15	It makes me feel pretty helpless.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	16	it is a sad situation altogether	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	17	How about all the people being displaced by conflicts like this? Are you in favor of welcoming refugees to the states?	1.0	0.6667	2.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	18	in most cases yes	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	19	I agree. Well, thanks for chatting! bye	0.6667	0.6667	1.3333	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	2	Yes i agree, its very sad	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	20	goodbye	0.6667	0.3333	1.0	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	3	How do you feel about the US backing Saudi interests in the region?	1.0	0.6667	2.3333	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	4	it's horrible, we need to stop involving ourselves	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	5	I agree. Installing a government that doesn't have the support of the local populace is an exercise in futility.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	6	many cases of that in the middle east	1.3333	0.6667	1.6667	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	7	Middle East, Central and South America	1.3333	0.6667	1.0	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
114	8	too much influence from israel and saudis	1.3333	0.6667	1.3333	1	45.0	7.0	113.0
114	9	Whom are being funded and armed by the American government.	1.3333	0.6667	1.6667	2	45.0	25.0	613.0
116	0	what are you feelings about the incident?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	1	Earthquakes are so scary. I'm from California and I know how tough they can be to deal with. But to hear of people stealing from those that suffered an earthquake is sickening.	2.0	4.3333	4.3333	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	10	what do you think can be done to curb this shameless act?	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	11	I'm not sure there is anything. Other than worse punishments for those caught stealing and looting. But it's so hard to prove that when the world around you is in such chaos. I mean the police have other things to focus on at that time.	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	12	Sure, but still there should be a balance	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	13	You'd like to think so. I'd like to believe people would just be kinder and nicer to one another. However, it seems like people are so much out for themselves and not worrying about others. It's hard to say if things can be brought into balance.	1.6667	3.0	4.0	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	14	I think there should be awareness or something?	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	15	You'd think there would be. However, people are so self centered right now. Everyone feels that they are owed things and it's about their needs and not necessarily about the greater good.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	16	I totally agree with you.....It is really just sad	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	17	It is sad. I mean at such a time when it's like the world is against you with a quake, you'd think people would see a bigger picture, but it seems they don't anymore.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	18	it's as if we are losing our humanity	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	19	"It does seem so. I think social media makes us see people different now. We don't see ""people"" and we have less human interaction now. I think we just don't feel we connect like we used to anymore."	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	2	I was so pissed reading that	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	20	sure, you are right.....goodbye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	21	Thanks for the chat. goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	0.3333	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	3	Yeah seems like such a shame. People should be coming together not trying to benefit off the suffering of others.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	4	Yes, in difficult time as that. I think what we should be thinking is a way to help the victims and not steal from them	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	5	Exactly. Earthquakes are devastating and so scary because there is so little you can do about them. Then you need to have people support you not steal from you.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	6	It's really sickening	2.0	4.0	3.0	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	7	Yeah, imagine having the world move under you and then when you're struggling to see what you have left, who is okay. Someone comes along and wants to steal your stuff. Terrible.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
116	8	That would really make the victims sad the more	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	9.0	5.0	115.0
116	9	Talk about being violated twice. Suffer the disaster than rather than getting help the people in your community want to take what little might have survived the quake. Crazy.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	9.0	44.0	615.0
117	0	That is just a terrible quake that happened in New Zealand	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	1	yea,horrible...and really scary	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	10	from my experience although im no expert i feel them during the summer mostly	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	11	"did you feel the most recent ""bigger one"" that was in the news recently?"	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	12	i sure did that one did last pretty long	1.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	13	wow...what does it exactly feel like? i imagine it feeling like your in a boat or something,like wavy sort of	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	14	its like if your on top of a wood plank and someone under has control of the movement moving it side to side or however they want like wavy	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	15	interesting...would you say that most houses/buildings in California are able to withstand a decent sized one? like how safe do you feel when it happens	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	16	the newer ones maybe i doubt the older ones would like my house was built in the 70's before i was born i doubt it would hold up	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	17	man,i'd be freaked out...	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	18	yeah but you cant stop nature	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	19	yea,i guess you just got to learn to live with them	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	2	I've personally experienced earthquakes and they are scary	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	20	theres no earthquakes where you're from?	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	21	i live in new york,there have been a few but I've never felt anything...they are usually way offshore and pretty small	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	22	i guess in new york you just have to deal with the cold	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	23	yea,winter sucks....snow storms are a real pain to deal with	1.3333	3.0	0.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	24	i cant imagine that! i guess every place has its pros and cons	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	25	yep	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	26	its been good fellow mturk friend. goodbye.	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	27	Same to you! i learned some interesting things from the convo....bye!	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	3	i can't imagine living in an earthquake prone area.....i'd be constantly worried	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	4	being from California you get used to them but you always wonder if its the big one when they are occuring	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	5	sure hope they could come up with a more accurate early detection system	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	6	yeah that seems like theyll never find a way	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	7	how often do you experience earthquakes?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
117	8	usually every year during the summer here in california	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	19.0	116.0
117	9	that's interesting,so they are more common in summer?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	9.0	1.0	616.0
118	0	Where do these governments get the money to pay for damages this extensive?	1.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	1	I have no idea...	1.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	10	Hm, I wonder if the area has been restored to a functioning capacity. The article talked about dams be broken and billions of dollars of damage being done to roads and buildings.	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	11	It wont be so easy to fix back...it would take years	1.6667	0.6667	1.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	12	No kidding. Have you ever experienced any natural disaster first hand? Second hand?	1.3333	0.6667	1.0	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	13	Only flooding...massive one	1.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	14	Was your family/property personally affected?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	15	My property was affected. We can exchange our bye	1.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	16	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	2	Neither do I. There were only two deaths involved in this article; so while I feel for those affected by both death and destruction of property, it doesn't hit as close to home as some of the other articles I have read.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	3	Yeah. Guess there was some sort of warnings. They kinda lucky when compared with less developed countries	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	4	I don't know. It said the quake happened just after midnight, but being in the ring of fire probably prepares people for these kinds of events both in an infrastructural and psychological sense.	1.6667	0.6667	2.3333	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	5	Yea, Adrenalin sets in and they can take shelther	1.3333	1.0	2.0	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	6	Have you ever personally experienced an earthquake?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	7	No I havent	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
118	8	Do you happen to know what year the earthquake we read about happened? I don't think it was mentioned.	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	9.0	25.0	117.0
118	9	I dont..I only skimmed it through	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	40.0	617.0
119	0	This is so sad. I hate hearing about big earthquakes.	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	1	tell me about it! There was one recently in California as well.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	10	I have some cousins in California but I don't talk to them. The rest of us are here in Tornado Central lol You?	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	11	My friend lives over there. He said the earthquake lasted 40 seconds at least!	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	12	Oh wow. That would terrify me. 40 seconds doesn't sound like a lot until you're in that kind of situation then it seems like forever	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	13	Oh yeah, i always thought they lasted 3-5 seconds. Boy was i wrong	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	14	yeah I guess my knowledge mostly comes from sitcoms where they have to shrink down a huge event into a span of a couple seconds lol	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	15	I wish there was some way we could help those families affected by the earthquake. :(	1.3333	3.0	4.6667	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	16	I'm sure there's some fund or charity set up to donate to but I'm always so hesitant unless I know 100% of my money is going there	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	17	That's true. Those charities can be very shady.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	18	I have to do a lot of research before committing and it always seems like its the ones that are for reasons like this where they're like 50% for them and 50% for said charity. It so sad	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	19	Yeah, if i lived where the families were affected, i'd rather spend time volunteering somehow	0.3333	1.6667	3.3333	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	2	That's right! There was 2 decent sized ones. I'm glad there wasn't the destruction that New Zealand got	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	20	Yeah I'd feel more like I was doing something to contribute	0.3333	1.6667	3.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	21	Same! Well It was nice talking to you!	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	22	Yes the same to you! bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	23	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	3	yea. I don't think anyone died so that's a good thing!	0.0	2.6667	3.0	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	4	That's definitely the best thing! They have months of rebuilding ahead of them	0.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	5	True. I can't even imagine how a town like that would start to rebuild.	1.0	1.6667	4.3333	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	6	I have no idea. All those homes lost. People must be heartbroken	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	7	Definitely. I am so glad i dont live in a state with earthquakes!	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
119	8	Same here. But we do get tornados I'm not sure one is any better lol	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	9.0	32.0	118.0
119	9	Haha. Do you have any family in states with earthquakes?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	9.0	17.0	618.0
120	0	What a sad situation! I think earthquakes are one of the most frightening natural disasters personally.	1.6667	3.3333	4.0	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	1	They are so scary and the destruction is awful	2.0	2.3333	4.3333	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	10	Yea, I guess you get to see both sides of the spectrum in situations like this. Great good and extreme bad. I wonder how long it is until we have better warning systems for earthquakes.	0.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	11	im not sure, i dont know much about it. but hopefully eventually all new buildings will be reinforced to withstand them	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	12	I guess that would require a lot of the older infrastructure to be torn down or replaced bit by bit. It seems like more of these natural disasters are happening as of late though.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	13	yes it does, but like you said - earthquakes are the most unpredictable and most destructive	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	14	Developing this tech should probably be of most importance. There has to be signs of plate movements within the earth before these hit.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	15	i agree, and im sure with time we will figure it out	0.3333	1.0	2.0	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	16	I'm thankful that I do not live in the Ring of Fire area. This has to be doubly stressful as you have to worry about volcanoes and earthquakes.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	17	volcanoes would be horrifying too, i hope the one in yellowstone doesn't erupt	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	18	Right! I remember reading an article that there are 15+ active volcanoes in the US. I can't remember the last time one of them erupted besides the eruptions in Hawaii. I doubt we are prepared for this disaster since we rarely experience them.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	19	i dont think most people even ever think about it	1.0	1.3333	3.0	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	2	The only ways to really combat them are through building standards I suppose. They hit so fast.	0.6667	1.6667	3.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	20	The last major volcano eruption was Mount St. Helens so I guess people have little reason to remember. The history channel does a good job of fear mongering super volcanoes though!	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	21	they definitely scare me, lol. it was nice talking to you, have a great day! goodbye	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	22	you as well :) bys	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	23	i believe you have to say bye, thank you goodbye	0.3333	0.6667	0.6667	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	24	bye	0.6667	0.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	25	7	1.0	0.0	0.0	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	26	goodbye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	3	yeah and even that sometimes isn't enough	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	4	And then the fact that they can trigger tsunamis and nuclear power plant leaks and such. Definitely little you can do to prepare.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	5	I agree. they are very scary and devastating	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	6	Kind of crappy that there are always people looking to loot and take advantage of those already at their lowest levels.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	7	yeah that is sad too, theres no excuse for that	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
120	8	I kind of feel like people caught performing this should face steeper sentencing than normal theft crimes.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	9.0	2.0	119.0
120	9	i agree. but it is also inspiring to see communities come together and help each other after these terrible events happen	0.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	9.0	7.0	619.0
122	0	That was depressing to read.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	1	Yeah it was pretty sad I thought	2.0	3.0	4.3333	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	10	what do you think can be done to solve this problem?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	11	Not to sound pessimistic but I'm not sure these is much that can be done.  IT seems certain areas/countries have had ongoing conflict for hundreds of years and resolving that is a tremendous undertaking.  What do you think can be done?	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	12	I think nothing can be done to be honest its a lost cause and that hurts to say but I don't see a solution at all.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	13	yes I don't either.  It's just sad for the innocents who fall victim to it.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	14	we are quite lucky to have not been born there.	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	15	Yes extremely lucky, I feel grateful every day for being here and sometimes think about how different things could be in a bad way if I had been born somewhere else.  It's easy to take it for granted so reading things like that is a good reminder.	0.0	3.0	2.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	16	yeah just waking up every morning having running water and toothpaste is a blessing and we never think of it as anything special. other people dont know any of that.	0.0	3.0	3.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	17	Yes you are right!!  Those things are so easy to take for granted.  And not having to fear for our safety or our family's safety every day	0.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	18	yeah man its amazing how those little things are so overlooked	0.0	3.0	3.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	19	yeah I guess we can take the opportunity to feel grateful for the little things today.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	2	Whats your opinion about it?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	20	I hope things get better in those countries though.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	21	Yeah me too.  It seems like it's just ongoing in some places like continuously no matter what.  It is sad.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	22	Its been a good talk friend. I agreed with you on everything. goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	23	You too, hope you have a great day.  goodbye	0.0	1.0	0.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	3	It especially made me sad to hear about the children who were affected but the people who were adults too.  It is kinda hard to relate to but I hate that anyone has to go through that and it makes me very grateful to be an American.  How about you?	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	4	you're right I can't relate to it either it is probably a good thing	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	5	yes for sure.  I can't imagine having to flee my country	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	6	would you flee as well if you were facing what they go through at home?	1.0	2.0	3.3333	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	7	I guess it would just depend on the situation.  If I thought my childrens' lives were in danger I would do whatever I had to to protect them.  What about you	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
122	8	Same here, which is why I don't understand when people tell them to fight at home and risk their kids lives.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	6.0	19.0	121.0
122	9	yes I could never do that and wouldnt expect others to	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	6.0	24.0	621.0
124	0	The refugee problem seems like it's getting worse.  We like to think the world is getting more civilized, but I guess not.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	1	In desperate circumstances the basest of man's desires will come to bare. Refugee's are easily exploited and potentially inordinately profitable. I think the reason why a lot of these problems are not being solved is because there are large groups of people who don't want them to be.	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	10	I disagree with most of that.  And we certainly don't have to answer the door.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	11	Pray explain. The door can always be kicked in.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	12	We could shoot these people at the border.  Maybe they'd reconsider fleeing and put up a fight in their own hellhole country.	1.6667	4.3333	1.3333	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	13	So, you'd prefer ethnic cleansing over immigration reform? Also, you know that most undocumented immigrants don't come through the southern border, right?	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	14	Your solution is to deal with the symptom, not the true disease.  You let countries get infested at the top and become unlivable, and everyone--Africans, Middle Easterners, Asians, and Hispanics--flee into civilized countries.  That's not a long term solution.	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	15	What do you consider the true disease?	1.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	16	Allowing dictators and corruption to lead other countries.  As far as I'm concerned the same people who flee their oppression are responsible for it.  They are responsible for their own leadership which they feel forced to flee.  I see no reason why they should piggyback off of our ability to live semi-harmoniously and threaten that.	1.6667	4.0	1.0	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	17	You do realize that the US often backs and installs the despotic governments that contravene the public's wishes and interests in these countries to further their own agenda? The resulting turmoil has our governments fingerprints all over it, so that try as they might to elect leaders that work for them they are headed off at every turn by international interest. You're claiming we have no responsibility to these people. I don't believe that.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	18	Well, believe what you want, it doesn't change reality.  I do have no responsibility to them.  They have responsibility to themselves.  And the influence the US has in these places is grossly overblown.  Either way these are brown-skinned savages.  Subhumans.	1.6667	4.6667	1.3333	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	19	You really think that?	1.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	2	I'm sure.  History appears to change but, as you say, man's instincts remain the same.  I think all the time, not just in desperate circumstances.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	20	Yes.  I do.  These people have had 10,000 years to become civilized.  They haven't.  Look at Africa.  It's a joke. EVERYTHING they have of modern culture is from empirialism.  Anyway, enlightening chat.  Thanks for having it with me.  bye	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	21	I think that your behavior is quite uncivilized. Honestly, It's hard not to think you're a plant from the researcher to elicit a specific type of argument. Keep working on being a good person! bye	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	3	I worded that improperly. I meant, when people can be easily manipulated and exploited there will undoubtedly be someone willing to do it for personal gain. Like, the so called crisis at our southern border. There are thousands of desperate people being forced into what amount to for-profit prisons funded by tax payer money. Do you think the people running those prisons want to rectify the issue with immigration? Of course not.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	4	I understood your point.  I just didn't really care.  Like I don't care about the refugees.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	5	Do go on.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	6	The world is too large to make individual problems global problems, and global problems individual problems.  The math doesn't work.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	7	The refugee crisis IS a global problem. Are you suggesting that we just ignore it?	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
124	8	Yes, I'm suggesting that I not make the problems of other individual people to be my problem.  They can create a country that's not a hellhole they have to flee from.  Somehow many countries have accomplished that.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	6.0	48.0	123.0
124	9	"These ""hellholes"" are people's homes that they don't want to leave. They've most usually been upended by US influence. These aren't just the problems of individual people, these are the problems of whole nations of people. You can only turn a blind eye for so long before that problem comes knocking on your door."	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	6.0	25.0	623.0
126	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	1	I feel that is the worst thing that can happen to a man	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	10	I don't remember but what happened to the person that caused the accident?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	11	I mean, he might become suicidal	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	12	I can see that. I wouldn't be able to live knowing what i did.. even if it was an accident	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	13	Yeah. Guess we can exchange our bye now. Nice talking with you	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	14	I thought we needed 10? We're only at  7 each	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	15	Ohh...my bad	1.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	16	Anything else you want to add about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	17	What sort of support can be done for the man?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	18	Probably a psychologist? He's definitely going to have some sort of mental issue	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	19	Exactly, it will happen.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	2	I feel so bad for him. I can't even imagine what he's going through.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	20	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	21	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	3	I tell you...I cant even imagine it	2.0	4.3333	4.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	4	I wish there was a way i could help him. It's terrible. I lost a friend to an accident once.. but to lose your family is crazy.	2.0	4.0	4.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	5	For real, so sorry about that.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	6	Do you think self driving cars will be able to prevent more accidents?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	7	I feel it will reduce it, that is only if everyone will use it.	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
126	8	Agreed. Man, those kids in the accident had so much ahead of them.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	314.0	17.0	125.0
126	9	And ti all got truncated like that. The man should be monitored though	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	314.0	40.0	625.0
128	0	Tell what you feel about the situation?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	1	Very tragic story.  I can't imagine being the father and trying to live with that pain.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	10	I hope they will be able to deal with the trauma	1.3333	3.6667	3.3333	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	11	Yes.  But at least the deceased are at peace now.  They were probably tortured brutally as they burned alive in that van.  But there's no more pain now.	1.0	3.6667	3.0	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	12	What do you think can be done to prevent such occurrence?	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	13	I think limiting immigration and brown-faced people from entering the country would help.  Did you notice that the person who caused the accident had a hispanic name, and of course the deceased were hispanic too.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	14	I do not think that is good idea	2.0	3.6667	1.0	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	15	Why, are you brown-faced?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	16	I'm black	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	17	That would explain this chat.	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	18	What do you mean by that?	1.6667	3.0	0.6667	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	19	Your question answers itself.	1.3333	2.6667	0.6667	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	2	It is so terryfying	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	20	goodbye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	21	bye	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	3	I wonder how the death of the people who crashed into the van will affect the father.  Now he has nowhere to direct his anger and grief.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad.	1.6667	3.3333	4.3333	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	4	Accident is really a terrible thing	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	5	Have you ever experienced an accident like this one?  Or known anyone who did?	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	6	Oh yes, I lost my dad through car crash so i know how it feels	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	7	I'm extremely sorry to hear that.  It must have been devastating.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
128	8	It was honestly	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	314.0	5.0	127.0
128	9	"I imagine the family members in this situation are saying a lot of ""what ifs.""  These people were even visiting from another country."	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	314.0	48.0	627.0
129	0	that was sad to read	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	1	Yeah, I can't imagine losing my whole family in a flash like that.	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	10	Definitely, you never know who is drunk driving or just a terrible driver. The worst drivers are around my area definitely	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	11	It's a risk that every motorist takes, and our country was constructed so that in most places an automobile/driver's license/auto insurance are a necessity. I empathize with the victims in the article, but unfortunately it's a reality that we have to deal with as a society.	1.0	1.6667	3.3333	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	12	Yes, but we should't take it as something normal. Death is not a normal thing and the quicker self driving cars become frequent the better in my opinion.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	13	I agree. Normal is a difficult word to parse, but there were 40,100 automobile fatalities in 2017. That's over 100 fatalities per day.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	14	those are some crazy statistics	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	15	I guess I should add a source for credibility: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/business/highway-traffic-safety.html My point is that innumerable lives could be saved with a radical restructuring of transportation in America.	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	16	In what way do you think they can restructure transportation?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	17	Can is one thing, willingness is a totally different monster. I think that high speed rail between metro areas is a viable option that would have manifold benefits. More progressive city planning is also a key investment to a future with less reliance on automobiles and gasoline. The urban sprawl is something we will have to see less and less of.	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	18	something like europe would be great people bike to work and stay fit at the same time	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	19	I completely agree. Well, it was nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	2	do you think anything can be done to prevent these types of crashes?	0.6667	0.6667	3.3333	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	20	bye	0.3333	0.6667	0.6667	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	3	I mean, besides driver's education and proper posted traffic warnings the only real way is for there to be a larger push for viable mass transportation.	0.6667	0.6667	2.6667	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	4	yeah man we need some other better forms of transportation its 2019	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	5	Self driving cars will be beyond the means of the average American for another generation at least. The automotive/oil industry still has enough clout to impede progress for years to come. A few human lives can't get in the way of profits.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	6	thats very true money runs everything and is the root of all evil as well	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	7	Do you have to commute/drive a car?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
129	8	Yeah I drive but its something needed there in California or else you can't get around.	0.6667	0.6667	1.3333	1	314.0	19.0	128.0
129	9	That's the idea. Do you feel like you're putting your life on the line every time you get out on the road?	1.0	0.6667	2.0	2	314.0	25.0	628.0
131	0	What do you think about the situation?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	1	I think its incredibly weird they wore vials of each others blood around their necks lol	2.0	3.3333	1.0	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	10	I'm trying not to believe that is true	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	11	I think she might have just been trying to get him some bad publicity or something he always seemed like a good dad to me but who knows what goes on behind closed doors	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	12	I really hope that is not true because i kind of respect him	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	13	Yeah he seems decent. I always liked him maybe they were just really toxic together.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	14	Do you genuinely think they can be back together?	1.0	0.3333	2.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	15	I think anything is possible. I guess it depends on how their relationship was before and if they can forgive and move on. But I kinda see her going towards a younger man now.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	16	Well, I hope they really. I like them together	0.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	17	Wonder what they reasoning for the vials of blood was? lol	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	18	haha, it was nice chatting with you. goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	19	you too! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.0	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	2	I was shocked about it though	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	3	She is really weird to me. I don't know what it is but I think she's just a tad creepy.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	4	You really think so?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	5	yes but maybe I'm just biased because I was very pro brad and jennifer lol	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	6	HAHA.... That explains your chat then	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	7	I just never understood why he'd leave her for Angelina, but what do I know lol I wonder if there's a chance Angelina and Billy Bob might reconcile now	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
131	8	I do not see that happening honestly	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	5.0	130.0
131	9	probably not. I'm not sure whatever happened to him. Do you think Brad was really abusive towards their children like the article mentioned?	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	73.0	32.0	630.0
132	0	I'm sorry his marriage did not work out.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	1	It was terrible. I felt a bit bad for him but not really because he's rich.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	10	I know single mothers and I'm a parent. How about you?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	11	I'm not a parent yet. Since you're a parent, how would you feel if you were a single parent?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	12	It would be hard. It is hard with both parents in the house.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	13	That's true. It's just tough for children to grow up with 1 parent in my opinion.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	14	My mother did a good job with me and my siblings.	0.0	3.0	2.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	15	That's good. Your mom's a superhero.	0.0	3.0	2.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	16	What do you think about marriage now days?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	17	I don't think it's necessary to be honest. You do this big wedding and now you say you're married. Ok now what? It's the smae as being bf/gf.	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	18	I got married at the court house 18 years ago.	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	19	I'm still not married yet at the age of 32. Am i too old?	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	2	Money is not always happiness, but I would like to be rich.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	20	Never too old, I'm 37. Just find yourself the right person.	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	21	That's true. IT was nice talking to you. bye!	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	22	you too bye.	0.3333	1.0	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	3	That's true. Are you a fan of Billy BOb Thornton or Angelina Jolie?	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	4	Not really, You?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	5	NO but i have seen Angelina Jolie's movies.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	6	They are okay actor and actress	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	7	Do you think Angelina Jolie deserves to keep the children?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
132	8	Besides from what I just read I do not know the details, so I guess so.	0.6667	1.3333	2.6667	1	73.0	30.0	131.0
132	9	Do you know any single mothers or parents in general?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	73.0	17.0	631.0
134	0	this happens a lot in relationships it seems	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	1	what does? breakups?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	10	Now that I think about my sister is married to someone about 10 years apart from her I guess it is normal nowadays lol.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	11	Yeah that's doable, but anything more is still getting weird.  What do you think about the blood vial thing?	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	12	you mean when they wore the blood of each other around their necks? that was some intense stuff to read. I don't know what to think of that, just weird.	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	13	Yeah I just find that to be a publicity stunt.  Keeps their names in the news.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	14	hollywood people are just weird, there are a lot of weirdos in that business.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	15	Yeah.  Do you think they're strange so they got into hollywood? Or are they strange because they got into hollywood?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	16	It's a little bit of both. I'm pretty su re there a lot of pedophiles in hollywood as well, a secret ring. It's just not a place you'd want to be at.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	17	Lol yeah you're probably right.  I'm sure there's a lot of Weinsteins, but concentrated on kids.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	18	Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the rumors about that were true.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	19	You probably just end up getting into crazy stuff because of their schedule, and ability to form meaningful relationships with other people.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	2	when someone does not feel good enough for the other	1.0	2.0	3.3333	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	20	imagine what the hollywood actors that start from childhood. Those are the ones that end up the worst.  Just look at all the stories of childhood stars and how they end up.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	21	Yeah you're really screwing with a kids brain when you put them in the limelight that early.  Not to bring basketball into it, but that's why I always appreciated Lebron James.   A star at an early age, yet he turned out to be a pretty stand up guy.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	22	Thats true or someone like Kobe Bryant who came out of High School as well.	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	23	Yeah.  Thing is though, Lebron was a star at 13, and he's been faithfully married (as far as we know) to the same girl since like 20.  Can't say the same about Kobe.	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	24	Kobe unfortunately will always be the better player and have had the better career but I see what you mean about Lebron.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	25	LOL WE HAVE AN EXTREME DISAGREEMENT NOW!	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	26	I'm a Laker fan and can't accept Lebron as the better player sorry.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	27	He is far and away the better player.  Kobe is a volume shooter, and good defender, but Lebron is sooo much more efficient with the ball on offense, and his defense is clearly better than Kobe.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	28	Game on the line , NBA finals, last shot to win the game, you choose Kobe plain and simple. The Black Mamba is the closest thing we ever saw to MJ.	1.0	3.0	1.6667	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	29	He was like a poor mans MJ.  Lebron however is a completely different player.  Unfortunately for Kobe too, the game isn't just decided in the last shot, it's decided by the other 100 before it as well.	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	3	Oh right.  I feel like Billy should haev expected that seeing as how he married a gorgous movie star who was 20 years younger than him.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	30	It's something we will never agree on lol. It was the best talk I ever had in one of these hits though thanks man!! Definitely wish you the best. goodbye	0.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	31	Lol same here! goodbye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	4	What do you think should be the maximum age difference between couples?	1.0	0.6667	2.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	5	Lol I'm assuming you don't mean legally, although there probably should be... but my parents were 12 years apart, and that was kind of pushing it.  I feel like normal people shouldn't exceed 15 years.  You?	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	6	Around 12-13 years I'm thinking. Anything more is too much.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	7	Yeah, there's just too many cultural obstacles to overcome, not to mention the difference in life stages.  My dad is retired, while my mom still has to work, it's kind of making things difficult.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
134	8	Well your parents are only 12 years apart it isn't that much compared to this guy who was 20 years apart from her that was too different from each other.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	73.0	19.0	133.0
134	9	Yeah.  Thing is though, I'm sure the majority of marriages in hollywood are done for almost purely professional reasons anyway..  I don't think these people actuallllyyy love each other .	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	73.0	49.0	633.0
136	0	Hello, what did you think about the situation with the divorce?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	1	I think divorce can be a healthy or a hurtful thing depending on the people involved. TMZ seemed to take a lighthearted approach to it. What do you think?	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	10	Ah, so sorry you had to go through all of that. Didn't mean to bring those thoughts back in your head.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	11	No worries. Anyway, I think that if two people are unhappy together divorce is the best option for all concerned.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	12	Definitely. There's no point in staying together if you're going to fight and argue, especially in front of your children.	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	13	Exactly, two happy and constructive homes are a far sight better than one unhappy one.	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	14	I wonder how Dakota and Elle Fanning are doing now. I don't remember if the article stated how old they were when their parents divorced.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	15	It said they were 22 and 18. So, they are both more or less adults and probably living on their own.	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	16	That's good to know.  But yeah to sum it all up for me, it's a sad situation but like you said.. as long as everyone is happy.	0.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	17	I feel the same way	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	18	It was nice talking to you! Thanks for sharing your story as well. bye!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	19	bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	2	I think the same although i do feel bad for Dakota and Elle	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	3	I'm actually not familiar with these people at all. What are they famous for?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	4	Actors. I believe Elle Fanning played Cinderella? Or one of the Disney movies.	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	5	Ah, that may explain why I'm not familiar. Are your parents married?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	6	Yup. Married for many years and still together so i don't know what they're going through. I'm sure it's tough. What about you?	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	7	My parents split when I was five. I really had a hard time dealing with it during my teenage years. So, I can empathize to a certain extent. I think it would be easier to process as an adult.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
136	8	I am sorry to hear that. Were you old enough to really understand and realize what happened with your parents?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	99.0	17.0	135.0
136	9	Divorce is something that unfolds as a child matures. At the time I was aware of the situation, but unfamiliar with the emotions and change that came with your parents splitting up. My father was absent for the lions share of my childhood years, so I spent a lot of time asking why.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	99.0	25.0	635.0
138	0	How do you feel about the article?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	1	It is terrible...I have never been a fan of divorce	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	10	Good to know we on same page as that	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	11	yea..the institution should be well guarded	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	12	I support that	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	13	Nice talking with you. bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	14	Not up to 10 turns mate	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	15	My bad...what do you have to add?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	16	what do you think can be done to prevent such things reoccurring in the society?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	17	People should know the effects of these on kids	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	18	And before getting into any marriage be sure you really want to spend the rest of your life with that person	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	19	Spot on!!!!	0.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	2	Me too	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	20	Good chatting with you....goodbye	0.6667	2.0	1.0	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	21	bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	3	I always believe it is workable	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	4	only if they both willing to make it work	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	5	Yeah..that is what most people aint willing to do	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	6	And that is really sad	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	7	Can you divorce?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
138	8	Not sure i ever want that. And you?	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	99.0	5.0	137.0
138	9	I dont see myself doing it	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	99.0	40.0	637.0
139	0	I'm happy they waited for the children to be over 18 before the marriage broke up.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	1	yeah that's true it is very rare for people to do that.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	10	Thanks, my grandmother gave me the advice that I will not be happy everyday.	0.6667	2.0	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	11	its a good thing your had a grandmother that was wise	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0

139	14	congratulations!	0.0	3.0	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	15	thanks!	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	16	I wonder if being in Hollywood put pressure on their marriage?	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	17	i believe  hollywood is just full of weirods	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	18	I use to think Hollywood makes you  weird.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	19	i think its a little of both	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	2	Yeah, long marriages are rare in general.	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	20	I agree. I know who the daughter is in the story. I have no clue about her father.	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	21	wonder why they didnt talk about him much	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	22	do you think money helps or hurts marriages?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	23	hurts tbh	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	24	I can see your point of view	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	25	its been good brother. goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	26	you too! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	3	why do you think that is?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	4	People think everyday will be a fairy tale.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	5	yeah its just not realistic no one is perfect and can give you that fairy tale life.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	6	when married there will be days you do not want to be married.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	7	its up to you to keep it to yourself until your head clears as well. if you still feel that way after your head clears its time to have that talk with your spouse.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
139	8	I got married at 19 and been married for 18 years I know it is not easy.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	99.0	30.0	138.0
139	9	thats a good rare marriage you have going	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	99.0	19.0	638.0
140	0	I was a little surprised that the Fanning's were in the news. I don't keep up with this stuff that much.	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	1	I don't either. I don't get why this is even news	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	10	Maybe they're trying to get some fame :D. It seems that the dad just up and left though. The article mentioned that he is not fighting that hard for the assets.	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	11	I guess maybe it was amicable? Maybe one of those situations where they stay together till the kids are grown	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	12	I guess it would be weird to fight over money your kid made for the most part anyway.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	13	that is true. neither one are probably really entitled to any of it lol	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	14	If I was in this position I can't see myself even keeping any of it. I would feel embarrassed	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	15	I would be too. I'd feel like I was embarrassing my kid too.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	16	At least there aren't stories about them stealing their kid's money. I've heard this happened with Gary Coleman	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	17	And Malculay Caulkin. I think his stepdad stole millions from all 8 of his kids	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	18	That's super sad. I mean you already have your kid working at a super early age(whether they see it as work or not) and to steal from them is despicable.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	19	yeah no kidding. It's child labor and the kid doesn't even get anything out of it except a lifetime of emotional problems. Like every child star on Disney	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	2	Haha exactly. I remember Dakota Fanning from when I was a kid but were his parents really ever in movie's themselves?	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	20	Lol and lets not even get into the rumors about the shady stuff that goes on. I mean I get that movies and shows need kids to act in them but I don't think as a parent I could like force my kids to be actors if they didn't push it themselves.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	21	No same here. I'm choosing a simple ordinary life for my kids maybe poorer but happier in the long run	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	22	And they can actually have a normal childhood. Imagine if your kid was like 10 and paparazzi were always hounding him for pictures. I can imagine that would mess up normal development in a way	1.0	3.0	2.3333	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	23	I can't even imagine what that would do to a kid	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	24	I have no more thoughts on the topic haha. Nice chatting with you. bye	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	25	you too bye	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	3	Wait Dakota is a guy? I thought he was that little girl that played in Uptown Girls with Brittany Murphy. whoops. I don't think so, I've never heard of them but then again I apparently am way off on who I thought any of these people were lol	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	4	It appears that I'm the one out of touch. She is indeed a girl. The point remains..why are her parents in the news :D	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	5	hahaha who knows. Some reporter somewhere apparently thinks we care about this. I feel sorry for them. Like who wants their divorce splashed all over the news?	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	6	Ehh I wonder. Sometimes it seems that certain celebrities like it and others don't. I am a private person so I really do not understand this type of thing.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	7	Same here. I don't know why you'd ever enjoy having your personal life and situations splashed on every tabloid. I can understand somewhat if you're a celeb. It comes with the job, but if her parents aren't famous except by her it seems terrible to publish their business	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
140	8	Do you think her parents put this in the news themselves?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	99.0	2.0	139.0
140	9	Maybe I guess I just can't wrap my head around the why. They aren't famous themselves (I don't think) unless they're trying to create some fame	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	99.0	32.0	639.0
141	0	The ISIS is a global threat	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	1	It's pretty vile, that's for sure.	1.0	3.0	3.3333	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	10	Exactly my point.	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	11	And yet there are many people and countries who like to think we're the bad guys.  People should get a clue and look in the face of true barbarism.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	12	It is sad really. We trying to do all we can to protect the world yet all we get in return is blame.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	13	"Absolutely.  But when you're the biggest fish, people are going to resent you.  We spend too much time concerning ourselves with what other people think of us.  Who cares?  They resent us because of our power, not because of how we wield it.  They want us to be weak.  That's when they ""approve"" of what we do."	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	14	Yea...i agree with that. hope we can exchange our bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	15	I think we need a few more rounds.  We can do this quickly.  I'd love to see us actively destroy ISIS.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	16	Same here...more arms for destruction	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	17	Be interesting to see if terrorism is discussed at all in the upcoming election.  Probably not.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	18	I would love that myself...bye	0.0	2.3333	1.0	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	19	yeah, good chatting.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	2	I feel the whole world power should stand up against them	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	3	I agree. Although I also think these countries that house and tolerate radical Islam need to step up as well.  They need to be forced to make a choice between civil societies or barbarism.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	4	Of course. That should be done. I mean, why protect the same pest harming and maiming you/	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	5	Agreed.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of cultures where passivity is the norm for the populace.  They accept whatever tyrant it is that wants to lead and abuse them.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	6	They they will be at the receiving end...	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	7	Absolutely.  And so, to some degree, they deserve their fate.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
141	8	I agree with that. What the world is expected to do is to prevent their spread	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	94.0	40.0	140.0
141	9	Absolutely.  You can't allow that virus to infect civilized cultures.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	94.0	48.0	640.0
142	0	Hey there. SO I found this article absolutely heartbreaking. Such a bad situation for so many.	2.0	4.6667	4.0	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	1	Yea it's definitely sad. I can't imagine growing up in a situation like this let alone tying to provide for a family.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	10	I wouldn't doubt that at all. I think the fact that they are using white flags as a way of disguising bombs is reprehensible. It would be great if all of the middle east countries came together to fix their problems.	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	11	These organizations also make it worse for every citizen when they leave their home countries. So many people are racist as they think all middle eastern people are supportive of terrorism.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	12	Your right. If people would just open their minds a little bit, they would find that there are good and bad people in every religious sect. I know some people that are in fact Muslim that completely disavow what's going on.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	13	I hope that this cycle runs it's course soon. The war on terror has gone on for 18 years now and I struggle to see if any progress has been made.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	14	I haven't seen any progress. I think that the more our military has a presence there, the more hostile the area becomes until it's completely destabilized. This is one of the paths towards radicalization. I will never get over the fact that they are brainwashing children to be cold blooded killers.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	15	Yea that's really disturbing. It kind of highlights the animalistic nature of man if twisted at an early age.	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	16	Yeah for sure. I can only imagine the brutal techniques used to radicalize them at such a young age. They should be doing kid stuff. Not being forced to participate in avts of war.	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	17	Just having a kid kill somebody is enough to really hinder development. I can't imagine what would go through a kid's head in that instance.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	18	It's hard to get your mind around it. Reading this gave me some pretty disturbing images, so one can only imagine what it's like to live in this nightmare.	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	19	I can imagine it would be extremely hard to live a normal life in this situation. Even trying to just work a normal job would be scary knowing you could die at any time.	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	2	It's just insane. I feel like the war on terror has been a massive failure.	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	20	It's no wonder there are so many fleeing. I would do the same.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	21	:(. That's all I have to say on this situation. bye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	22	bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	3	More like a waste. Terrorists are way more of a threat to their own countries compared to a threat to the USA.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	4	I wholeheartedly agree. I hate to say it, but I think our country being involved in perpetuating these regime change wars does more harm than good.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	5	Kind of. When US armed forces are in a country fighting terrorism this allows the home country to take a back seat. If US forces were not there these countries would have to face the problem head on from a military aspect as well as cultural.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	6	Agreed. They need to handle their problems on their own. In many cases we say it's to spread democracy, but a majority of middle east countries just want to run things their own way. I feel terrible about the kids there that have been indoctrinated. The poor parents may never have their kids back.	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	7	Using kids as tools is definitely the worst aspect. I find it hard to see how people can kill in the name of a religion. Seems so wrong.	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
142	8	"It's pretty ridiculous. It's not just the kids either. The women are treated like second rate citizens. The article mentioned how women are being ""redistributed"". That's pretty sick."	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	94.0	18.0	141.0
142	9	As well as just blindly killing people for having cell phones. I wonder if some of these organizations only claim the religious aspect but really have other motives.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	94.0	2.0	641.0
145	0	hey what were your thoughts on this	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	1	i think its said anytime civilians have to go through this. what about you?	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	10	maybe someday we all seem more connected with social media something can be done	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	11	yeah definitely with social media you see people from other countries interacting with each other like they're neighbors	0.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	12	exactly i think more people are informed and want to help	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	13	yeah people seem to care they just dont have the outlet to show it	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	14	i think with this violence only violence can combat it	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	15	yeah some people are just evil and have no other solution	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	16	they have alot of isis propogana over there im sure this thing is just going to spread so sad	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	17	definitely propaganda is one of the worst things ever created by man	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	18	yes need to cut of the snake at the head	1.0	3.0	0.6667	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	19	hopefully things get better	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	2	its sad in this day and age this is happening	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	20	agree it was a great conversation thanks! bye	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	21	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	3	yeah its quite sad honestly. what do you think can be done to fix this?	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	4	I think more military presence needs to be there from outside nations	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	5	definitely also we need to stop being the world police	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	6	true but things like this they cant help themselves then its spreads	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	7	true we have to find a middle line of helping and keeping away at the same time	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
145	8	yeah i agree more peace in the world	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	94.0	53.0	144.0
145	9	do you think that is possible?	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	94.0	19.0	644.0
147	0	How do you feel about ISIS's methods of manipulation and control?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	1	I hate everything about ISIS..i really hope they can be totally eliminated...You?	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	10	How do you feel about the US's influence in Iraq throughout the past couple of decades?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	11	In as much as we playing the big brother role, I feel we should focus more on how to protect ourselves.	1.5	2.0	2.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	12	Do you think we should support the people being displaced by the conflict in Iraq?	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	13	We should spread our self out too much..we do the little we can and other countries should take in those they can	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	14	I'm of a similar opinion. There's only so much empathy in a human population. After a certain point the reserves are exhausted and resentment begins to creep in.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	15	Exactly..	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	16	Does fear play a meaningful part in the decisions you make in your daily life?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	17	It does...I can be carefree at times though	1.5	2.3333	1.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	18	Well, I'm glad you get some carefree moments. It was nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	2	Well, I think their methods are certainly effective. I don't condone them by any means, but they have disillusioned youth from all over the world joining their rank and file.	1.5	1.6667	2.3333	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	3	It is sad really...	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	4	The thought of children being forced to commit executions is a special kind of venality.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	5	It really is. I wish we can have more ways to control this though	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	6	This kind of radicalism is rooted in ideologies older than civilization itself. I think the only way to get rid of it would be to allow it to devour itself.	1.5	2.0	2.0	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	7	Yea, we should totally protect our self from it. That is the only way we can intervene.	1.5	2.6667	2.0	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
147	8	I'm inclined to agree. By giving groups like this an enemy we are only feeding the fire of their zealotry.	1.5	2.0	2.3333	1	147.0	25.0	146.0
147	9	Of course..the attention will make them grow stronger	1.5	2.0	2.3333	2	147.0	40.0	646.0
148	0	Tell me how you feel about the article?	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	1	It makes me feel sad. So many people have died	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	10	But it's really so sad how haze can kill thousands of people	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	11	It really is. We get haze and smog from time to time and I've never thought about it being harmful except in the case of like car accidents	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	12	I never thought so too	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	13	I'm sure it'll happen again and again with more needless deaths. But I cannot figure out what could possibly be done to prevent it	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	14	I really feel so sad for their families	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	15	I wonder if there's anything set up to donate	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	16	I hope so too, something just to help	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	17	No kidding those people need so much help its unreal	1.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	18	it has been good chatting with you, goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	19	bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	2	i feel the same	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	3	It says its an annual problem. I wish there was something that could be done	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	4	what do you think went wrong?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	5	I have no idea. What do you think?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	6	I do not have idea too	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	7	Do you think anything can be done?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
148	8	Not sure and you?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	147.0	5.0	147.0
148	9	I'm not sure.	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	147.0	32.0	647.0
149	0	Its always sad when things like this happen	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	1	It's pretty amazing how many people they think died.  Although Indonesia has an extremely large population.  I think it's one of the top 4 or 5 in the world.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	10	Some countries are just that openly corrupt.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	11	On the other hand, if they outlawed the palm oil industry, they might have hundreds of thousands of people starve.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	12	its a tough subject I would just hope they found other ways to help people not starve	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	13	Absolutely.  I believe palm oil production has some other really bad effect on the environment.  I can't remember what.  Maybe something to do with polluting the water.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	14	that and the effect on the youngsters when they grow up	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	15	Yeah, that's the part they don't even know about.  I can't fathom the long-term damage to kids if this haze is killing hundreds of thousands outright.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	16	wish we had the medical knowledge to know what happens to them so they see the production of the palm oil is a bad thing	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	17	That would be nice but I'm not sure it would get through to them.  Money talks more than the health concerns of millions of people they don't actually care about.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	18	money definitely is the root of all evil	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	19	Oh, it's gotta be.  That and contraception.	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	2	Do you think that the polulation numbers had something to do with this?	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	20	and hard drugs addictions	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	21	Definitely.  sex traffickers.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	22	so true man the worst people on earth	2.0	3.0	1.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	23	Yeah, I think we nailed it.	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	24	good job on the convo bro. goodbye	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	25	Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Take care.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	3	Well, it just means the population is more dense, and more people get affected by the haze.	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	4	didn't think of that one makes snese	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	5	I think it's pitiful because it shows what the rest of the world is up against with respect to environmental issues.  These countries are more concerned about their economics than enivronment.  They burn down forests to make palm oil.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	6	Yep, here in California seems we have wild fires every year as well. Less casualties of course but they're fires.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	7	At least those ones aren't started intentionally.  Well, I mean some of them might be arson, but that's different.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
149	8	yeah, this one was a whole other type of fire	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	147.0	19.0	148.0
149	9	I just think it's amazing the different perspective different people have on society and value of life and that type of thing.  Can you imagine the U.S. government, or even state governments, allowing burning down forests that killed tens or hundreds of thousands of people like this?	1.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	147.0	48.0	648.0
152	0	Hello, what did you think about the fire and what happened?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	1	I think that the death of pets is always tragic for those they are dear to.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	10	Nope, thank goodness. So what do you think that family that was in the fire should do now? They lost everything, it's terrible.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	11	Hopefully they were insured. I mean what do you do after a fire? You just start all over.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	12	It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	13	It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	14	Just the fact that the pets were trapped inside. I'm sure they'll look into a doggy door or something next time around.	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	15	Yeah, was it mentioned how the fire started? i don't remember.	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	16	Me too. Did it mention what kind of pets they werE?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	17	I believe 2 cats. Wonder if cats can start a fire..	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	18	I don't think so. The article was pretty brief and vague	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	19	Cats are capable of much more than humans give them credit for	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	2	I agree. Do you own any pets?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	20	True. Well it was nice talking to you. bye!	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	21	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	3	No. I had a dog when I was a teenager. How about yourself?	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	4	I have two dogs. Love them to death so i can't even imagine what those people are going through.	0.6667	4.0	3.3333	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	5	What kind of dogs are they?	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	6	One is a Lab and the other is a Maltese	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	7	Neat. I had a golden retriever when I was a kid. He was my best friend.	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
152	8	Golden retrievers are really smart. So have you been through, or know anyone, that has been in a fire before	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	125.0	17.0	151.0
152	9	Actually, no. I can't think of anyone even relating a story about a fire to me. How about you?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	125.0	25.0	651.0
153	0	These stories are always sad to hear. Fires are probably one of the disasters I really fear.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	1	I can't imagine losing one pet let alone two.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	10	I wonder what the situation was like for the family to have to leave their pets. Must have happened fast.	1.0	2.0	3.6667	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	11	i cant imagine the moments before the  fire started	1.3333	2.6667	4.0	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	12	I would assume that the family was asleep or how else could they have left the pets? That or were not in the home. Fires do start fast though.	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	13	fires defnitely travel fast and silent sometimes too	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	14	Hard for a person to really combat it either. With an electrical or grease fire, water would only add to it.	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	15	yeah most people arent knowledgeable on those things	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	16	I live in an apartment and have had two fires right next to my building. I wish people took more precautions	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	17	As a kid I can remember a fire starting near our apartment, at the apartments across from ours. Luckily they were able to stop it from flowing onto the next apartments.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	18	Yea I saw a fire take three apartments a few days before Christmas. I felt so bad, especially for the people who lost their stuff to water damage from the firefighters having to put it out	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	19	i can cope losing tv's phones etc but losing memories in pictures is scary	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	2	Yea that's rough. At least the people all lived.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	20	Yea we lost a ton of our stuff as a kid. Really sucked. That's all I have to say on this though. bye	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	125.0	2.0	152.0

153	4	I remember my house burning down as a kid. In the moment it's so scary. The Red Cross really does a lot of work helping in these situations.	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	5	Do you have experience with the Red Cross?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	6	I can't remember which organization helped when I was a kid(was 5) but I have seen them help my neighbors when their apartment burned down.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	7	thats good that those organizations are in place to help	0.0	2.0	2.3333	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
153	8	Yea it's nice but still minimal. Better to try and get insurance that covers a fire.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	125.0	2.0	152.0
153	9	yeah youre right about that	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	125.0	19.0	652.0
154	0	Losing your home in a fire has got to be pretty terrible.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	1	It really is...its sad	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	10	If you could take three things from your house in the case of a fire, what would they be?	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	11	My phone, certificates and a cloth	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	12	What is the cloth if you don't mind me asking?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	13	I have a ash cardigan my wife gave me as the first gift	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	14	You have any kids?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	15	None yet...	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	16	Lol nice.  Enjoy your time.	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	17	You? You've got any?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	18	I've got one, and it looks like that'll be it.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	19	hahaha...alright. bye	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	2	I always feel bad when people lose animals.  They don't get the sympathy like someone would who lost family, but losing pets still hurts a lot.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	20	bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	3	almost similar hurt...its like losing kids	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	4	yeah.  hopefully they get back on their feet quickly thougn.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	5	I hope so....I just hope they have their home insured also	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	6	Yeah that's true.  That must be a real kick in the pants if the cause of the fire was your own doing too, and the insurance company doesnt pay out.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	7	another twist...I pray that is not the case though	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
154	8	Its tought that all their memories were lost with that house, at least with most other natural disasters, you get a chance to plan ahead.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	125.0	49.0	153.0
154	9	Yeah, you can get to pick a few things	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	2	125.0	40.0	653.0
155	0	Hello what did you think about the article	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	1	It was so sad. :( I can't imagine losing a pet like that.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	10	Not only that but they probably lost all their favorite toys as well, sigh.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	11	Mmhm, and family photos, drawings... so many memories. I can't imagine that.	1.6667	3.6667	4.3333	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	12	Have you ever been burned? Even one small burn hurts like heck	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	13	Yeah, by a curling iron once when I was little decently badly. Not fun at all.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	14	Ouch! I got burned because my brother put a hot pan on my arm when we were younger	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	15	Yikes! On purpose or by accident?	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	16	It was on purpose but we were just children so it happens i guess	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	17	Yeah, kids be crazy like that. Have you known anyone who lost their home like in the story? Or a pet?	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	18	Nope. Thank God and i really hope something like that never happens to anyone! Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	3.3333	2.6667	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	19	You too. bye!	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	2	Yeah i think it said they lost both cats. It's a sad and tragic situation	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	3	Yeah. Like, not only did you lose your house, you lost your two best little buds. That's awful.	2.0	4.0	4.6667	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	4	I hope the family didn't get burned or hurt in any way	1.3333	2.3333	3.6667	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	5	It sounded like they got out without issue, so that's good.	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	6	That's good! Wonder how they're doing now after what happened	0.0	3.0	2.3333	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	7	I dunno. I feel really bad for the little kids. :(	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
155	8	Yeah! It must have been traumatizing and something that would stay with them forever	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	1	125.0	17.0	154.0
155	9	For sure. I hope they get new pets soon.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	125.0	13.0	654.0
157	0	This article was very eye opening. I had no idea air pollution killed so many people.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	1	i agree,it's scary that pollution could have such a direct impact on people's health	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	10	I wish that article talked about the effect of bad air pollution on people without lung cancer in california	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	11	i was thinking the same thing,i wonder how pollution effects people without lung cancer....i mean,it can't be good...just probably not as noticeable	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	12	yeah, I feel like the article in general was lacking, interesting content but it definitely needed more info	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	13	it kind of left me with more questions,feel like i'm gonna have to do some googling now,lol	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	14	I wonder if that was the intent, just to give us a taste and motivation to do further research on our own.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	15	certainly effective if that's what they wanted to do	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	16	I feel like most people won't care about air pollution until it gets so bad they can hardly breathe, then maybe things will change.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	17	Yea,people will need to see and feel it in order to change,but i think by that time it'll be to late..it sucks	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	18	Yep, that seems to be how it's been going with everything else. Our attention spans are so short it seems like no one can really be bothered with anything unless its a major issue that lasts a while and is right in our face.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	19	i think it's honestly just human nature...it's weird that a behavior that probably helped us evolve and survive will most likely be our downfall	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	2	Over half a million people die in India from bad air quality? That's insane, I wonder what can be done about it.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	20	That's a good point. I do think we could all be more proactive about positive change though. There's got to be a way to make it happen. Education is certainly one area that could improve.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	21	oh for sure,education is important to getting people to change...people need to have first hand knowledge of this stuff,otherwise they can just ignore it	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	22	After that though, how can we motivate action? It's like protesting, once an issue has been made known, and awareness has increased, I wonder what can be done to cause people to demand action, instead of just forgetting about it or moving on to the next topic	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	23	"i don't know if there is really anything else to do.... it's a ""lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink"" type of thing....people will either want to change or not"	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	24	Yeah, also there's so many issues in our society that need addressing i think it's hard for people to focus on any one problem.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	25	the internet really brings these problems into everyone's lives,like,before the internet people could focus on one thing that effect them the most and get more done	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	26	I agree, well it was nice having this chat with you, I really enjoyed it. goodbye	0.0	2.3333	1.0	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	27	really good chat,goodbye!	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	3	i guess education about the problem is the best anyone can do at this point	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	4	Yeah, I didn't know lung cancer was the second deadliest form of cancer either.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	5	yea,i'd think that would have went down since people don't smoke as much anymore	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	6	Yeah, I grew up in a smoking household. Secondhand smoke does suck, are you a smoker?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	7	unfortunately yes,been trying to quit recently...it's tough	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
157	8	Good friend of mine has been smoking his whole life and switched over to E cigs, he says it's better. I don't know much about them though.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	302.0	46.0	156.0
157	9	i actually have an e-cig,it's helpful but you still get cravings for an actual cigarette	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	302.0	1.0	656.0
158	0	Tell me how you feel about the article?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	1	I have neutral feelings toward the article overall	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	10	Not really, but i read articles about people living with it	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	11	Do you feel some kind of connection with people suffering from cancer?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	12	Not really, Just feel pity for them.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	13	How would it make you feel if you discovered that some these patients were offended by your pity?	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	14	I would change my ways toward the person	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	15	How would you change your ways?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	16	By not feeling sad for them again	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	17	Do you think the study was conclusive?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	18	No, it is not.	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	19	How do you think the study could be improved?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	2	And why did you say that?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	20	By conducting more research?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	21	Do you have any particular suggestions regarding the research methodology? What would be a good way to investigate the survival rates of lung cancer patients exposed to polution?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	22	I think getting data from all hospitals, or having a data base for that will help	0.3333	1.0	1.0	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	23	That sounds like a start. Are you interested in this particular kind of research?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	24	Not for now, maybe in the near future.	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	25	Why not now? If you don't mind my asking	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	26	Not ready for the commitment i have to put into the research project	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	27	What do you think about the people dying in India from air pollution?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	28	sad and hope there is anything that can be the done	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	29	How would you feel if you found out there wasn't anything that could be done?	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	3	I was not really surprised by the findings and the study was not detailed	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	30	well then fine, i think we have a good conversation. goodbye	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	31	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	4	oh, do you have any idea about the topic before?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	5	No, but it makes sense that pollutants could act as an irritant and adversely affect those with preexisting lung conditions. How do you feel about the article?	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	6	I feel sad for people living with lung cancer in general	2.0	2.6667	4.0	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	7	Why do you feel sad for them?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
158	8	it is never a good thing to deal with	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	302.0	5.0	157.0
158	9	Do you know anyone who has or has had cancer?	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	302.0	35.0	657.0
160	0	This article makes sense. Those poor people.	1.3333	2.3333	3.6667	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	1	Yeah, I could have definitely drawn this conclusion without assistance. I think poor air quality affects everyone.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	10	that is very disturbing. It makes you wonder if population control is a real thing.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	11	If the government doesn't do it the environment will. There are already natural controls in place.	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	12	that is very true. there is different danger everywhere. so many different things could kill us at anytime. it is just better to not think about it.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	13	I think mindfulness is important, but dwelling on destructive things like that turns toxic very quickly. Do you engage in any behaviors that help limit air pollution? I know as individuals we have limited capacities.	0.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	14	I work from home so I do not drive my car very often. I recycle. I try not to turn my air conditioner on much in the summer. these are small things but if everybody did something i think it would help.	0.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	15	I agree. I think that's just about all you can do on an individual scale. Good for you!	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	16	I am glad  more people are standing up for the environment. I love seeing celebrities spreading the word.	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	17	It's nice, but I enjoy seeing everyday people joining the fight just as much. I just recently got my mother into recycling and composting. Her garden has never looked better.	0.0	2.0	2.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	18	Thats awesome! I enjoy gardening as well. i feel like the food I get from my garden tastes so much better than store bought.	0.0	3.0	2.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	19	Always! Well, thanks for chatting with me. Have a great day! bye	0.0	2.6667	0.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	2	yes, i agree. The smog in places like china is disturbing.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	20	you as well bye!	0.0	2.0	0.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	3	Beijing, Santiago, Delhi, L.A. There are so many places where the air really isn't even safe to breath	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	4	And then you think about all the wild fires in LA and wonder what those people are breathing in.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	5	Right? So, it stands to reason that a person suffering from lung cancer would have a lower life expectancy in such a place. Unfortunately, most people can't afford to just move out to the country.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	6	It also makes you wonder how many people are aware of the air pollution issues where they live and how it is effecting them.]	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	7	Honestly, if there's nothing you can do about it it's probably better for their mental health if they just ignore it.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
160	8	that is a very good point. I wish the government would somehow regulate the air pollution.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	302.0	16.0	159.0
160	9	Wouldn't that be a treat? Unfortunately, the EPA has been gutted and the current administration is rolling back protections against air pollution.	1.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	302.0	25.0	659.0
161	0	What do you think about the situation with the polar bears?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	1	I feel like the Polar bears are getting screwed in every way imagineable.  If it isn't one thing getting em, it's another.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	10	oh no that's terrible! It's not the bear's fault	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	11	No, but I think humans have this innate feeling that the world is ours for the taking.  Not sure how we correct that though.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	12	Probably no way. I just feel bad for them. Imagine killing a mother polar bear.. what's going to happen to the babies?! It's all so sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	13	Yeah.  I watch a lot of BBC nature programs too.  I'm sure a lot of it is edited, but everytime they show footage of polar bears, you're left holding back tears.	1.0	2.0	4.0	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	14	I don't even hold back my tears. I just bawl because it's so sad. I remember seeing a video where a hawk ate one of the babies.	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	15	Ha, as sad as that is though, that doesn't bug me. Circle of life shit.  That's how nature is supposed to be.  What bugs me is when you see how humans are disrupting the natural cycle of things, and other animals pay for it.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	16	That's true. I definitely don't do all that i can to help the environment	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	17	I've definitely been trying to do more the last several years.  It can get kind of depressing though when you realize what a small impact you can actually have.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	18	really? one person can make an impact?	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	19	I mean, you don't have any other choice in my opinion.  I try to get others to follow suit as well.  Grassroots type stuff.  I also try to ensure that I'm not overbearing about it though, I think that turns people off.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	2	It's terrible though. Did the article mention what the tourists did to the polar bears?	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	20	I will definitely try to do more in the future. Well it was nice talking to you my friend. bye!	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	21	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	3	That's what I was wondering too.  Are the tourists actually the ones killing them, or are they getting attacked more, so officials have to kill the bears?	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	4	It was a pretty short article so i'm not sure. Either way, poor polar bears. :(	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	5	Yeah it's like, if we're not completely destroying their environment, we're gonna tour into whats left of it, and kill them that way.  Tough life for a Polar Bear.	1.3333	2.6667	3.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	6	How can we help the polar bears? :(	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	7	"I think other than the basics of respecting our environment, and voting in political candidates who would enact policies, I""m not sure there is much we can do."	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
161	8	Maybe the tourists are stealing all of the polar bear's food.	1.6667	1.3333	3.3333	1	375.0	17.0	160.0
161	9	Lol I hope tourists aren't eating seal pups... I'm sure just the interaction ends with having to kill polar bears. I know that happens frequently where I'll go hiking.  There will be a bear attack, and officials then have to find and kill the bear, otherwise they'll attack more humans.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	375.0	49.0	660.0
162	0	It's a shame that people still hunt endangered animals for pure sport.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	1	it is very wicked and sad	2.0	4.0	4.0	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	10	I can imagine that if more people had to kill the food that they eat their outlooks would be different. Easy for a person to pull a trigger from far away.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	11	Its is human wickedness to the planet. Humans are the most selfish	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	12	Yes a lot humans have evolved into something disgusting. People take pleasure in wicked things. It sucks	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	13	WHat do you think can be done to protect those animals. They might go into extinction soon	1.0	1.6667	3.6667	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	14	More education on the issue to younger kids would help. Steep fines and penalties would deter this as well.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	15	Yeah. I feel proper education for the kids would help. But then, most kids copy their parents	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	16	If kids were educated I think they would not follow their parents. Probably will take more species going extinct though :(	1.0	2.6667	3.0	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	17	You have a very valid point.	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	18	People are so removed from nature though that they tune these things out. If it doesn't impact their everyday lives it is easy to ignore.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	19	That is sad. Nice talking with you. bye	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	2	I wish there was some type of organization that worked with local authorities of these people to issue fines or punishments.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	20	:( bye	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	3	Exactly. The locals can set up some committee though	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	4	I'm not sure if there are locals where these polar bears are being killed though.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	5	There should...	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	6	It's hard for me to see the side of a person that kills an animal like this for sport. Does it make them feel good about themselves? Most of the time they're shooting from helicopters and such.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	7	It is inhumane. It is some form of entertainment for them	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
162	8	Or a power trip I guess. It actually makes me a bit sick to my stomach seeing people post pictures of the kills with themselves smiling on Facebook.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	375.0	2.0	161.0
162	9	I blocked some of my friends that engaged in such. It is totally different if the killing os for survival	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	375.0	40.0	661.0
165	0	I feel bad for the polar bears	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	1	I'm curious how they're dying.  Are people hunting them or are their habitats being affected.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	10	Yes, at the Toledo Zoo	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	11	I've seen them too.  They look cuddly and friendly but of course they're not.	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	12	Yeah, Coke made them cuddly	0.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	13	Indeed.  It'll be shocking if such a big, familiar animal goes extinct in our lifetime.  I suppose they won't because of the zoos.  But they might disappear from the wild.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	14	I agree, but sadly we have to worry about humans at the rate we are going with climate change.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	15	I think some humans.  But we're like cockroaches.  I think we'll find a way to survive.  Or most of us will.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	16	I hope so	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	17	I sort of feel like we'll get what we deserve.  If we deserve to suffer from our treatment of the environment, we will.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	18	I agree, no animal on earth last forever.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	19	Yeah, that's another perspective.  Bears and humans have NOT existed for far, far, far more of earth's history than they have.  We tend to view the present as the way things are supposed to be.  But they're not.  That's just our narrow perspective.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	2	The article did not have a lot of information.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	20	I agree, dinosaurs had a much longer run.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	21	And are much more interesting.  Maybe one day some other species will study how we died out.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	22	odds are laugh at how greedy we were.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	23	Yeah, I'm sure they'd find plenty to be disgusted by.  Heck, people already do.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	24	Do you think we can change?	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	25	No.  I think we're animals and we act this way because it's in our blood.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	26	Sadly I agree	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	27	Any other thoughts on this topic?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	28	can't think of any, bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	29	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	3	No, it sure didn't.  But yeah, it seems ridiculous that people are going up there, possibly to enjoy the polar bears, and they're dying as a result.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	4	I do not think polar bears are going to make it.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	5	They're in pretty bad trouble, for sure.  We'll see if their behavior changes in their changing environment.	1.6667	2.3333	4.0	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	6	I hope their behavior changes, but with the ice melting, I think it is too late.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	7	It definitely could be. And the arctic isn't a very friendly place to try to figure out where to get more food.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
165	8	Don't plenty of zoos have polar bears for people to see?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	375.0	30.0	164.0
165	9	Yes, but I suppose people want to see them in the wild.  Have you ever seen a polar bear in person?	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	375.0	48.0	664.0
167	0	It's hard for me to understand how a parent could send their kids off to a situation like this.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	1	I agree.  But I think they feel they need their children to earn income to support the family.  How about stop having kids.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	10	And the people who are in positions to utilize this growth are against immigration. Could help everybody if we just worked together.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	11	Yes, but that's probably been true since the beginning of humanity.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	12	It sucks that there is so little that people outside of the country experiencing the child labor can do to help solve the problem.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	13	Yeah.  I guess it's just got to be a grass roots thing where citizens say their countries aren't going to act that way anymore, and it trickles up into authority and the governments themselves.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	14	I think that government actions from foreign nations could help. Embargoes placed until countries do something but this is hard to see happening.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	15	"Yeah, that would probably help.  But it's a logistical nightmare.  Can countries like the U.S. and E.U. really ""police"" this stuff and monitor it enough to truly make a difference.  Look at this story.  What was the result of an international agency getting involved.  They PAID OFF the guy who enslaved the kids.  In other words, they ENCOURAGED him to do it again.  (Admittedly, he was later arrested.)  But we have to be careful about HOW we intervene, not just that we do."	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	16	Did they pay him off? I thought the kids were compensated not the business.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	17	No, they paid for the children's release.  That's how I read it.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	18	I remember seeing that the girls were paid 4,000 as back-pay as well. Definitely a logistical nightmare though. People are too afraid to offend the host countries I'd assume.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	19	That's another part of it.  There's always some attempt to respect the sovereignty of nations.  But at what point do you intervene because you believe you know better.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	2	If the job is available for the kid to work then the parents could work the same job. They are sacrificing the kids potential future for minimal payments.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	20	True. Either you want the USA to be world police or not. Hard to find the balance! Nice chatting to you about this though. bye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	21	Yes, I enjoyed the chat.  Thank you.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	3	It's definitely sad.  In this situation there seems to be no shortage of blame to go around.  Parents, slave-owners, authorities.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	4	Hard to even know where to start. Better wages for normal jobs would help parents to not face this decision.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	5	That's probably part of it, although I don't know much about the Burmese economy.  But overpopulation is a big problem, too.  And corrupt governments.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	6	Yes overpopulation is definitely a problem that will continue to get worse. Hard to stop nature though.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	7	Yeah, it's situations like this that help you appreciate how similar we are to animals.  Most of what we do isn't driven by reason.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
167	8	Logic and emotions don't mix haha. I think China had the right idea with limiting their population and now that seems to be removed. Resources are not infinite imo.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	228.0	2.0	166.0
167	9	It's interesting how it works though.  Western countries aren't having kids at rates fast enough to replinish the population.  So it's immigrants from less-civilized nations growing the population.  In other words, an irony: the people who can't sustain themselves (as well) are the ones growing the population.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	228.0	48.0	666.0
168	0	What do you think about the article?	0.5	1.0	1.6667	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	1	I thought it was terribly deppressing what these children had to go through	1.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	10	i support that too	0.5	2.0	2.6667	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	11	i think everyone supports that	0.5	2.0	1.6667	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	12	That is right, what do you think about Swen Win?	0.5	1.6667	1.6667	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	13	she has great heart for getting involved	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	14	Yes she was the hero of the story	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	15	yeah thats when things started to move when she got involved	0.0	1.6667	2.0	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	16	I really applauded her	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	17	if she never got involved nothing wouldve happened	0.5	1.6667	2.6667	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	18	I really do not want to think about that	0.5	3.0	2.6667	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	19	good thing it didnt go that way. its been a good talk. bye.	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	228.0	19.0	667.0

168	20	I need to tell you first.... goodbye	0.5	1.6667	1.0	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	3	Yeah its just disgusting	2.0	4.0	5.0	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	4	It was so terrible and to think the police was not helping	2.0	3.6667	5.0	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	5	What do you think should be done	0.5	1.3333	2.3333	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	6	I think appropriate punishment should be given	0.5	2.0	2.3333	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	7	no doubt about it.	0.5	2.0	2.3333	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
168	8	What do you think as well?	0.5	1.0	2.3333	1	228.0	5.0	167.0
168	9	i think capital punishment should be given	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	228.0	19.0	667.0
169	0	I would have believed that there were abuses of human rights going on in situations like this, but holy crap, the accusations of the broken fingers and stuff is infuriating.	2.0	4.6667	4.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	1	The world is a crazy place, I feel bad for the girls and their families.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	10	That's kind of why I think travel is extremely important.  If you have the means to travel, you owe it to yourself to get out and see the world, see how other people live their life, and hopefully understand that there is more to this earth than your little bubble.	0.3333	2.6667	3.6667	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	11	I do think of the or people have the upper hand is some major event happened to the earth. I do not know how to hunt or grow crops so I would be dead pretty quick	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	12	Lol, oh yeah we've become incredibly reliant on tech.  If that was yanked from under our feet, and we had to go back to working the earth, we're f'd.	1.0	3.0	2.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	13	I wonder why the police would not help the girls at first?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	14	I'm sure accusations like this occur all the time.  Maybe the police brush it off regularly?  The difference might have been that international journalists got involved.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	15	Have you been to other countries? I have only been to Canada	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	16	Yeah I've been to several.  Italy, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Eleuthera.	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	17	How were the local people living?	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	18	In the last three it was pretty dismal compared to here.  Thing was though, they seemed happier.  It's funny how wealth doesn't really buy happiness.	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	19	I always say you don't miss what you don't know.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	2	yeah, women still have it pretty tough in other places of the world.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	20	Yeah, and the simple things that they do have gives them a lot of joy.  I played some basketball in Eleuthera, and they were freaking having a blast trying to dunk on the white boy.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	21	any other thoughts on the article?	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	22	Nah, just sucks to hear that this is still common for such a large people group.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	23	I agree with you. It was nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	24	bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	3	Sadly, odds are they are sexually abusing them too.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	4	Oh for sure.  I wonder if the families know that that's inevitable when they send their children to do this.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	5	I don't think they have a choice since they are so poor	2.0	1.3333	2.6667	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	6	Yeah, but I wonder if there's hope that they'll land in a good place, and prosper?	1.0	2.0	3.3333	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	7	I think they have the hope, but they still might know the danger too. I could see myself sending my daughters away	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
169	8	Oo I guess I could understand that.  It's easy for us to say here in America, assuming that's where you're from, that we wouldn't do that.	0.6667	2.0	3.0	1	228.0	49.0	168.0
169	9	Yeah, I am in America I think most American have no clue how the rest of the world is living.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	228.0	30.0	668.0
170	0	How disturbing that these young girls were enslaved, how does this article make you feel?	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	1	makes me feel horrible to think that there are things like this going on in the world	2.0	4.0	4.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	10	I was wondering how the UN might put pressure on the Burmese government to correct this. Sanctions perhaps? Or maybe an intervention force?	0.6667	1.0	2.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	11	sanctions are probably the best bet i'd think	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	12	How effective would they be? How quickly would sanctions work?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	13	well,i guess depends on what exactly is being sanctioned....i know they export a decent amount of petroleum gas...so that would be a good starting point	0.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	14	That seems like a great place to start. So many adults were complicit. It must be a cultural issue there to devalue a child's life	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	15	that's the tough part,how do you get to them to stop doing something that's seemingly culturally accepted	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	16	Education I suppose. I think the practice is considered tolerable because the victims are poor. It's hard to teach someone that all human beings are equal when they live so differently	0.6667	1.6667	3.3333	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	17	yea,kind of depressing since them being poor is unlikely to change..education can only do so much when they are doing it for money	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	18	Lol how can someone be educated to love their own children more than they love money. This is why I think the international community has do more to prevent this kind of exploitation of young innocent children	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	19	right,exactly...but besides sanctions what do you think the international community can do?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	2	They were robbed of their innocence. When I think about how their parents sent them to this tailor I get angry. How could you do that as parents?	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	20	Some kind of peace keeping force to patrol the areas most likely to be affected by this kind of human trafficking? what do you think?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	21	that would be helpful,but i doubt the myanmar's government would allow those optics	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	22	They would if there were sufficiently many members of the international community behind the idea. Without some serious intervention and consequences this ugly practice will continue, I mean just look at our own history. It took the Civil War to end slavery, without it who knows how long slavery would have lasted	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	23	maybe even use sanctions as leverage if they refuse	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	24	That sounds like a plan. Between sanctions and a peacekeeping force they would have no choice but to agree. But it can't be that simple because the human trafficking is ongoing. What have we overlooked in this situation?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	25	i don't think we overlooked anything really....it's just getting all these things to align properly i think.	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	26	Or maybe the international community are not all on board. If that's true I wonder why that might be?	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	27	Myanmar has a fair bit of geopolitical importance,i guess there could be some fear of losing the government as an asset	1.0	1.0	2.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	28	You may very well be right. Greed strikes again	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	29	it always comes back to it....from the parents,the traffickers,the international community,the local government.....geez	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	3	"yea i know..i mean,i understand that they are poor but come on,that's a crazy ""excuse"""	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	30	It has been an interesting conversation, goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	31	yea,very interesting chat,bye!	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	4	Being poor is no excuse in my opinion. What's even worse is that they were physically abused	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	5	right,you already made these poor girls slaves,couldn't they have at least been treated well? i hope there are no lasting psychological effects	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	6	Of course they will be. What a shame that the authorities only intervened after international headlines popped up	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	7	i wonder how many are still going through this	1.3333	1.6667	3.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
170	8	probably thousands. the question is how does an organization like the UN step in to stop these atrocities?	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	228.0	35.0	169.0
170	9	i suppose they could try a big educational type of campaign..maybe form some volunteer groups in the country,but without out help from the local authorities/government there isn't much they can do	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	228.0	1.0	669.0
171	0	I thought this was rather sad just because it was the loss of an innocent life and a baby at that.  I don't know much about rhinos really.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	1	Yes, I assume the baby was orphaned from poaching, although I'm just assuming that.	1.3333	1.3333	3.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	10	Yeah, like why did it not survive?  They really didn't touch on any of that.  What is the overall survival rate for these orphaned rhinos?  It mentioned it was a special orphanage just for them, right?	1.6667	1.3333	3.0	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	11	Yes, I believe so.  Have you ever seen a rhino in person?  They're remarkable creatures.  Like living tanks or something.  The closest thing to dinosaurs still around, I suppose.	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	12	I remember seeing one at the zoo when I was a child.  I don't think I have since then.  That's a neat comparison as far as dinosaurs, I could see that resemblance.  Makes me want to go to a zoo!	0.0	1.6667	2.0	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	13	Uh huh.  I've seen them a couple times.  Rhinos and hippos always fascinate me.  Just seems such a waste to kill them, especially for a trinket.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	14	Yeah you are right!  Like the horns.  It truly is a waste.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	15	I guess these people working with the orphaned animals probably feel it's about all they can do for the cause.  I'm not sure what else people can do to influence poaching in a meaningful way.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	16	Yeah that's a good point, too.  It must be some pretty dedicated and caring people who do this.  I wonder who funds the whole orphanage operation.	0.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	17	Yeah, I'm not sure.  I assume they're non-profit organizations, or affiliated with animal welfare groups/programs.  I assume at higher levels these organizations lobby countries to crack down harder on poaching, but of course there's money involved, so there's corruption, and these are sovereign nations anyway, so outsiders can only exert so much influence.	1.0	1.6667	3.3333	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	18	Yeah, certainly there must be politics involved.  The whole scene seems very sad.  I am glad some individuals and groups are trying to do something about it, though.  It has been nice discussing this with you, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Have a great afternoon.  goodbye!	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	19	Yes, it was nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	2	Yeah I kinda assumed the same which adds an extra level of sadness to it	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	3	Yes, poaching seems brutal and unnecessary, although the people doing it would argue it's their livelihood, I suppose.  But I still find it sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	4	Yeah I totally agree.  I also don't know much about it but it does seem brutal and unnecessary to me.  I am not sure that they even use all the parts of the animals they kill.  I think not.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	5	Right, I think they just use the horns.   Or sell them.  These people who treat the orphaned animals must have a hard time with it.  True, there are probably success stories where they nurse them back to health and find them homes, but when they see these animals the first time they're always in a bad place.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	6	Yeah I am sure they form an attachment to the little animals and it is very sad to lose one.  I mean they have named them and everything.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	7	Yeah, that's a good point about naming them.  They aren't just creatures at that point.  They're little personalities.	0.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
171	8	Yeah exactly almost like a pet or something.  They didn't give much detail in the article so a little more information would have helped, like some background info maybe.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	400.0	24.0	170.0
171	9	Yes, I agree.  I wondered what type of suffering the animal had been through.  Maybe just starving or something.  Or maybe injured.  But there weren't many details for sure.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	400.0	48.0	670.0
172	0	How do you feel about baby rhinos?	0.6667	0.6667	1.6667	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	1	I love animals. I was just heartbroken to hear that sad story.	1.3333	3.6667	4.0	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	10	I came up similarly. My grandparents had a ranch and all the wildlife that comes with it. Do you believe that animals deserve the same rights as humans?	0.6667	2.0	3.0	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	11	I totally do. They have just as much right to life and be protected as humans. We can both share this planet and by taking care of animals we do our part to keep the balance in nature.	0.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	12	I completely agree. Animals are often more loyal and loving than most humans. We need them more than we care to admit as a species and that's not just mammals, birds and insects are an important part of the equation also.	0.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	13	I couldn't agree more. My dogs are part of my family. I can't imagine treating animals with less respect than another human, as you say they are often more deserving of compassion than some people. Even those animals we raised for food, we treated them with care and respect. That's how it should be. Do onto others applies to animals the same as people in my mind.	0.6667	3.6667	2.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	14	My family spoils their dogs rotten. I don't think they could be happier with their position in life, and that makes me glad. I volunteer as a foster pet parent and developing a bond of trust with a troubled pup is one of the most rewarding things. What kind of dogs do you have?	0.0	2.6667	2.0	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	15	I would love to foster, but I get so attached so easily I'd never want to give them up. Ours are spoiled as well, they run the house more than we do. I have a yellow lab and a lab/german shorthair mix.	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	16	Yeah, it's really hard to let them go. I'm reassured by knowing that they are being sent to a happy home where they will be loved and cared for.	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	17	Yes, even knowing that in the end I'm giving another family a chance to have that special relationship with a dog. Bringing all that love into a new family would be wonderful but still so hard. I'm so glad there are people like you that can give that to new families and animals, it's such a rewarding and amazing thing.	0.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	18	It really is! Thanks so much for chatting today. It was really pleasant (^_^) bye	0.0	2.6667	0.6667	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	19	I had a nice time chatting with you as well. goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	2	Me too. I wish they would have included more details. The whole thing was very vague. Did the rhino die because of the lack of power?	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	3	Yeah, I wanted to know more as well. I think from what they said she was an orphaned rhino and I guess the place they took her didn't have a lot of support in place and she needed a lot of help is sounded like. I definitely wanted to know more details.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	4	It was really touching how the person spoke about the rhino, almost as if it were their very own child.	1.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	5	Yes, that was part of what made it so heartbreaking. They were obviously very invested in doing all they could for her. I wish I knew if that was some sanctuary or organization that is trying to help rhinos so that money could be raised to improve conditions so that perhaps they could save more babies.	1.0	3.6667	4.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	6	Yeah, that's part of the reason why the brevity of the article was so frustrating. I'm sure that poaching leaves an inordinate amount of orphaned creatures.	1.3333	3.6667	3.0	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	7	I'm sure it does. Both wounded and abandoned. I just felt like I was getting only one tiny piece and I wanted to know so much more.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
172	8	Do you have any experience with animals? Pets or otherwise?	0.6667	0.6667	1.3333	1	400.0	25.0	171.0
172	9	I've grown up around animals all my life. Horses, cows, chickens, ducks, dogs, cats, goats, pigs. Pretty much you name it and I've had a hand in raising it while growing up. I currently have two dogs of my own. Any animal suffering story really hits me hard. I'm a huge animal lover.	1.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	400.0	44.0	671.0
174	0	that is a sad situation	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	1	It is really sad...at such a tender age?	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	10	what do you think can be done?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	11	Well I feel its natural, when its bound to happen, no one can stop it. We have one of the best health institutions in the world IMO	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	12	i agree	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	13	I cant imagine losing a kid...	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	14	its too tough to think about	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	15	Have you ever lost someone close to you?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	16	not yet but it unfortunately will happen to all of us at one point..	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	17	Hmmnnnn..that is true	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	18	yeah scary stuff	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	19	I feel the parents should join a support group	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	2	yeah what do you think happened the article didnt say much	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	20	i agree with that thats a great idea	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	21	Yea...it will really help a lot	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	22	well it was a good talk man. bye.	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	23	be	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	24	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	25	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	3	I really cant figure it out. I feel so terrible for the parent though	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	4	did the article say where the parent was?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	5	No they dont. Did you see anything of such nature?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	6	not really the article was missing a lot of key stuff	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	7	Exactly. How do you think child motality can be reduced?	1.0	1.0	2.3333	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
174	8	probably have power running in the orphanage for a start	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	400.0	19.0	173.0
174	9	Yeah. That will be a great start	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	400.0	40.0	673.0
176	0	I think its crazy how females need consent to travel abroad in that country	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	1	Me too!  As an American woman, I just find that mind-blowing and somewhat ridiculous.  I realize that their culture is very different from ours, though.  But sheesh.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	10	I believe sanctions would work wonders	0.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	11	They seem to have been effective in other areas.  I would think that we do a lot of economic trading with Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, who knows, there could be some dangerous ramifications for us for challenging their deeply held cultural beliefs.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	12	It is a slippery slope I agree. That is part of their culture at the end of the day for women to be treated that way	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	13	Yes and a long held tradition.  I'm sure this has been debated and discussed at length among groups such as the UN, etc.  I would think anyhow.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	14	yeah youre right. I guess they have every right to be that way although its odd	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	15	Yeah it is.  It was also interesting in the article that some women were opposing the changes.  I guess that just goes to show it is such a part of their culture they see it as normal and do not want it to change.  SEems weird to me but to each their own.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	16	or maybe theyre forced to go against the changes	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	17	Yeah that is true.  You never really know with that country.  They might just be saying what they think they are supposed to say to avoid negative repercussions.	1.0	1.6667	3.3333	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	18	yeah this isnt their first rodeo lol	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	19	Right? lol.  I'm sure they have learned to say and do what will keep them out of trouble.	1.0	1.6667	3.6667	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	2	Wow youre a female so you understand this more. As a man even I know its just not right!	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	20	didn't they kill some guy in an embassy a few months back as well or something like that. they just are not the most trustworthy people	2.0	1.3333	2.6667	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	21	I have not heard about that but I am sure you are probably right.  It seems like senseless violence is just a part of the culture there.  Not that it isn't here either, but it seems more out of hand there.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you about this.  I hope you have a nice afternoon.  Goodbye	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	22	you too . bye.	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	3	Yeah it seems absurd.  I'm glad they are taking some steps to at least give females there some more privileges to do some reasonable things without a male escort.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	4	It makes me wonder what else females cant do in that country jeez	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	5	Yeah I know right?  Like what CAN they do?  Is Saudi Arabia where they have to hide their faces or is that somewhere else?  I'm just grateful I live in the USA.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	6	Well it seems any country is better for females than Saudi Arabia.	1.0	2.0	3.3333	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	7	yeah no doubt.  I mean I honestly support traditional gender roles and all that, but they seem to take it to a major extreme there.  I think they need to loosen up the reins a little bit.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
176	8	It seems that international pressure is the only thing that can fix this	1.0	1.3333	2.6667	1	283.0	19.0	175.0
176	9	What do you think would work, economic sanctions?  Military power?  I am thinking that is where they see woman as objects and property, correct?	1.0	1.0	3.0	2	283.0	24.0	675.0
177	0	I think it'll be interesting to see how this type of movement will progress.  It's easier than ever with social media to create social change.	0.0	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	1	It would help if some outside nations would comment on the situation.	0.6667	1.0	2.6667	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	10	I think you exaggerate the consequences, but I understand your point.  My brother actually lives in Saudi Arabia and, as I said before, the male-female relational dynamics at a personal level are quite different from the systemic restraints.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	11	Hard to say exactly what the consequences would be but I'd bet that some women would have it worse than others. I wonder how this situation impacts women without a husband. Are they allowed these freedoms or are they forced to marry?	1.0	1.6667	3.6667	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	12	I don't believe they're legally forced to marry, but since employment is limited, it's sort of a necessity.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	13	But this unmarried woman would still not be allowed to drive, leave the country, make her own doctor's appointments and such?	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	14	I believe women are actually now allowed to drive.  I could be wrong about that but I think that was a recent change.  However, no, she'd have to get a male relative to sign off on her leaving the country.  Not sure about things like doctor's appointments. That might actually be the opposite, where it might be considered inappropriate for a man to be involved in that.  But not sure.	1.0	1.3333	2.6667	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	15	Ahh I remember the article stating that women needed permission when undergoing hospital treatment. It's hard for me to see the benefits of this limited freedom, social norm or not.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	16	I think the social media and internet influence in this is interesting.  i can imagine the women at home, spending a lot of time on their phones, seeing lives they want to be leading and that, in part, motivating them to seek change.  On some level it's no different than people in the West seeing a pair of sneakers they want, or a vacation one their friends took, and being desirous of that, too.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	17	Yea I can imagine that's part of it. No person should have to sit and dream about basic freedoms that 99% of other adult women have the option to make. And then being forced to remain in the country as well.	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	18	Do you think the number is really as high as 99%  I think patriarchal cultures are still more prevalent than that.	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	19	Probably closer to 90% but I do not know of many other countries that restrict the right of women. Maybe this is more common in middle eastern countries	0.3333	1.3333	3.3333	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	2	It might.  But Saudis are proud.  If you go telling the King and his people that what they're doing is morally wrong, I think they're just as likely to spite you as to listen.	2.0	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	20	Yes, I'm not sure.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Thanks for taking the time.  Have a good day.  bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	21	you as well! bye	0.0	1.0	1.0	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	3	Do you not feel the men of this nation are already doing a similar thing? It would help if all women in this nation felt this way.	2.0	1.3333	3.0	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	4	I'm not sure what you mean about the men.  Could you explain further?	0.6667	0.6667	1.6667	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	5	It does not seem like the men of this country are receptive to women speaking out against this system. Is this a logical response or are they too proud to realize how wrong this system is.	2.0	1.0	2.6667	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	6	"I think ""wrongness"" is something that's not as simple as it might seem.  It's easy for us to criticize it from the outside, but we also weren't raised in that culture and see it very differently.  Also, the male-female dynamics inside relationships and homes are very different than the societal restraints put on women."	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	7	It's not just us criticizing it but what sounds like a lot of women in that country as well. Social restraints are not the same thing as having to listen to your husband as if he was your parent.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
177	8	What about the Saudi women who want the system to stay the same?  Do you think they're brainwashed, or suffering from Stockholm Syndrome?  Or do you think their perspective is valid too?  Just curious.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	283.0	48.0	176.0
177	9	I think their perspective is valid but definitely a  mixture of brainwashing or could just be it's scary to have to take a stand against the old system. It's probably easier for a lot of women to not buck the norm and face hellish consequences.	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	283.0	2.0	676.0
179	0	Hello what did you think about the article	0.6667	0.6667	1.6667	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	1	I can't even imagine having to live like that as a woman. I support the women who are trying to get rid of the program.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	10	That's true. We should be very fortunate because we have freedom to do what we want.. kinda	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	11	Reading this article, I feel as a woman that I am very fortunate.	0.0	2.6667	3.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	12	That's great to hear. Would you ever date a partner that is controlling?	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	13	I like to think that I wouldn't, but I think sometimes controlling people don't really show themselves at first. What about you?	0.6667	1.3333	2.6667	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	14	That's an interesting take. I don't think i would ever be able to!	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	15	That's good. I'm sure if I found myself with a controlling partner, it would not last long!	0.6667	3.0	3.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	16	I hope the women in Saudi Arabia are able to find freedom within the next 10 years, i feel they have bene suffering for a long time	1.0	2.6667	4.0	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	17	Yeah, I hope so too! It's been nice chatting with you!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	18	Nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.0	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	19	bye	0.6667	0.6667	1.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	2	It's terrible. Imagine having to ask your partner for permission to do anything	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	3	I seriously think I would be jailed or murdered if I lived there. I couldn't do it. And sometimes they have to ask their own son for permission.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	4	That is crazy! You would have to kill me before i ask my son for permission to do something!	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	5	I know, and I wonder what age the son is old enough to make the decisions. I bet it's pretty yound.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	6	Probably. Imagine asking a 10 year old for permission to do something. Doesn't seem real..	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	7	It's unreal. I hope that these women are able to change something, but probably even if the system is ended, they will still be treated the same way by their families.	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
179	8	Yeah, it's going to take MANY years of remolding their brains and seeing things from different perspectives until there is actual change	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	283.0	17.0	178.0
179	9	I agree, it will probably take a very long time, but I guess change has to start somewhere.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	283.0	57.0	678.0
181	0	So I found this to be very tragic.  What kind of sick person creates a suicide website to attract little children?	2.0	4.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	1	I can't even imagine how someone like that or multiple someone's like that can even exist. I am angered and saddened that these troubled kids are targeted in such a way.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	10	Yeah I have no idea, I am as mindblown as you are.  They should really have a special punishment for people like that who prey on these types of young victims.  I guess with every site you shut down another new one can just pop right back up.  That's the scary thing about the internet.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	11	It is. I don't want to start down a censorship slope, but you can see why the idea has merit. If you can't stop people from using the internet to harm others, what choice do you have? I'd like to believe parents or schools or someone could step in to help these troubled kids and lead them away from the internet that is causing them more harm than good.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	12	Yes, ultimately it should be the parents who are censoring and policing things like that at home but obviously in these cases the parents are failing to do that job.  So who can step in to help?	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	13	I wish I knew. That is why this is continuing I suppose. And the fact that people don't like to talk about suicide, as if it's a dirty secret. Hopefully, more talk can lead to more people being aware online and doing more to keep shutting sites down.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	14	Yeah, like if they got things like this more out in the open.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	15	Have more warnings about the dangers. Try to find what it is that lures kids to these sights and try and use those same tactics to lead them to locations of help rather than these nasty suicide cults or whatever they are.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	16	Yes and maybe have very harsh punishments for the offenders they catch.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	17	Yes, do more than shut the sites down. Track the people that are putting them up and doing more to punish their behavior.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	18	Yes! Like charge them with homicide.  It has been nice discussing this tragic topic with you.  goodbye	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	19	It's been a pleasure talking with you too. goodbye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	2	Yeah me too, like they are already at a disadvantage with families where they lack support and have rampant alcoholism and abuse.  They don't need predators preying on them like this.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	3	Exactly. Who enjoys seeing such misery inflicted on others? I can't even begin to imagine how someone like that can do something like this. It's clear that Russia has a problem and then to see someone doing something like encouraging more deaths. It's sickening.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	4	It really is!  I have heard of some of these suicide sites before and I find it appalling and sickening.  People should be trying to help the situation not fuelling the fire.  What on earth.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	5	I know. I just can't understand the mindset of people that find this enjoyable or acceptable. You'd like to believe that these troubled kids could go online to find the help they need that they can't or aren't getting at home. Intead, they are used as a sick game to disgusting people. Unreal.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	6	It really is unreal.  And it said that some of the owners of the sites they had found were not much older than the children they were targeting.  What would even compel someone to do something like this?	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	7	I really don't know. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how someone must think to do this. It's like bullying. They said it fed their egos? Who enjoys knowing they hurt other people?	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
181	8	Yeah what on earth?  Like it makes them feel powerful or something?  I have no idea but it sounds like the mindset of a serial killer to me.  Which in a way, those people kinda are serial killers.	1.3333	3.6667	2.3333	1	305.0	24.0	180.0
181	9	Yeah, it'd say they are. It's crazy that someone would relish doing this kind of thing. How does someone even think that this is something appealing to them? How does it even get started. I just don't know why or what you can do to stop something like this.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	305.0	44.0	680.0
182	0	How do you feel about these, basically, Russian suicide communities?	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	1	I guess I think it's sad that kids feel so sad and alienated (or whatever) that they are drawn to them.  But I also think it's pitiful that people lose themselves in internet groups like this.  It's artificial.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	10	If factor in western countries with higher quality of life (Noway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands) whose suicide rates are less then 1% i'm sure it skews the data.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	11	I'd also suggest that the FOCUS on the internet communities themselves is maybe misguided.  Seems like a whack-a-mole problem in terms of shutting them down.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	12	It's much easier to make a half hearted effort to apply blame and deal with superficial corollaries of social problems than address them at the root.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	13	Absolutely.  A culture of victimhood.  But it does nothing to help the actual kids.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	14	No, meaningful action against this problem would require time, money, empathy and a sense of duty to ones fellow man that is very scarce in the world today. It's the equivalent of cutting hair and just expecting it not to grow back.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	15	"I also wonder what the right balance is for issues pertaining to mental illness and health.  At what point does ""help"" and ""sympathy"" becoming enabling and rationalizing?  When does trying to eliminate stigma becoming encouraging people to self-diagnose and use mental health as a crutch, or excuse."	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	16	Well, help and sympathy are two mutually exclusive concepts. A lot of the time people who are experiencing intense isolation just need someone to talk to. I think that people who are actually diagnosed rely too heavily on prescription medication (which are only supposed to be a temporary crutch) and prefer to ignore the human element in therapy which is often the most beneficial.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	17	I'd agree with that.  In all parts of medicine, prescribing a pill has become the easy, satisfying thing to do. I'm flabbergasted when I see reports quoting the number of people taking things like Ambien.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	18	Ambien, antibiotics, anti-depressants. It's a depressing and short sighted landscape to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting. I think you were probably the most insightful person so far. bye	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	19	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.3333	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	2	Artificial? How do you mean?	0.6667	0.6667	1.0	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	3	I just think that the emotions we experience online are very different--much more intense--than what we experience in reality.  Ironically.  If we'd turn off our phones and the TV and went outside, we'd discover that there's a big difference between the virtual worlds on our screens, and the real world.  And the time we spend in the virtual ones doesn't seem to be good for our mental health, especially when we're already vulnerable.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	4	It's true, a disturbing amount of humans put more effort into cultivating and maintaining a paltry digital simulacrum of themselves than they do their actual body/mind/relationships. I think in a lot of ways, for children growing up in our world, the digital world is much more real than the one that physically surrounds them everyday.	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	5	I agree, and I think that's sad.  It's ironic that in mental health, mindfulness is the current push.  And I think that the way we engage with the internet is the antithesis of being mindful.  So you have this strange dichotomy where more people need, or think they need, mental health help, which will push them towards things like mindfulness, while those same people do the exact opposite thing while engaging in their virtual worlds.	1.3333	2.6667	3.6667	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	6	Mindfulness, in essence, is non-committal engagement of ones thoughts and feelings; acknowledging them as they are and letting them pass over you. The internet, on the other hand, is potentially a coliseum of unhinged emotional responses to both real world and subjective events and opinions. I think you're absolutely correct. People in our society are very quick to diagnose themselves, but rarely exert the effort to actually plumb the depths of their personal experience with a person who is qualified to make those diagnoses.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	7	I'd suggest that in this story, the parents are most capable of providing help, in all ways, but apparently the parents are a large part of the problem, what with the drinking and abuse and whatnot.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
182	8	I think they are the most capable and most incapable in the same turn depending on the circumstances. I think more actual community involvement is key in these types of situations. Less time online and more time interacting with human beings toward a common goal.	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	305.0	25.0	181.0
182	9	The statistics intrigued me.  First, the inordinately high depression and suicide rates for Russia.  But also the 5% number (teenage depression, I believe it was) for the rest of the West.  That number seems low to me, though I don't really know.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	305.0	48.0	681.0
183	0	Tell me what you think about the article?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	1	I was alarmed by some of the high suicide rates in Russian adolescents. I had no idea it was  so high and prevalent.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	10	Yes, i think so too	0.6667	1.0	3.0	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	11	Which specific factors were you thinking of?	0.6667	0.6667	1.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	12	I'm actually more concerned about the mental health status. I think it is the major factor	1.0	1.3333	3.0	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	13	I think that can play a role, but Russia has the 3rd highest rate of adolescent suicide, 20%. Furthermore 45% of Russian teenage girls reported thoughts of suicide and 27% of teenage boys did the same. I think there is much more going on	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	14	wow, those are large numbers	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	15	Yea disturbingly large. I think social media paints a portrait of a lifestyle that is beyond the reach of many young Russians. Coupled with poor economic prospects many of them fall into despair, apathy, and hopeless thoughts.	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	16	what do you think can be done to prevent this?	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	17	I think one solution would be to require social media websites to offer online counseling services to their users, particularly to those who are at risk	0.6667	1.3333	2.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	18	I totally agree with that. goodbye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	19	What suggestions do you have?	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	2	I feel so sad about it	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	20	Well, i think more awareness should be done so people with mental health can get help	1.0	1.0	3.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	21	I agree, but the trouble is that mental illness is not always easy to spot and sometimes these people are difficult to treat because of that	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	22	More awareness means urging people with it to get help which i believe some will willing want to get help as well.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	23	Maybe you're right. I also think we should discourage young people from idolizing vapid ''public figures'' and ''influencers'' they encounter on social media. Most of those people do not add value to society	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	24	That is absolutely correct	0.3333	1.3333	2.6667	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	25	I am wondering why we are not having a similar debate about these issues here in the US	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	26	I think it is about priorities.	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	27	What makes you say that?	1.0	0.6667	1.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	28	Maybe there are more important this people focused on	0.6667	1.0	2.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	29	Don't you think that teen suicide is important enough to focus on?	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	3	Were you aware that adolescent suicide rates are also on the rise here in the US?	1.3333	1.0	2.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	30	Yes i do, but sadly so many people do not.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	31	That breaks my heart. It has been interesting chatting with you today. bye	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	32	Thank you, bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	4	Yes i was surprised when i found out	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	5	I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia can be directly linked to social media groups. The rise of adolescent suicide here in the US directly parallels the growth and popularity of social media	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	6	I will agree with that	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	7	Why do you think Russian teens are embracing this online suicide culture?	1.0	0.6667	3.0	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
183	8	Maybe it is more about mental health?	0.6667	1.3333	3.3333	1	305.0	5.0	182.0
183	9	It could be that. Do you think socioeconomic factors play a role?	0.6667	0.6667	2.6667	2	305.0	35.0	682.0
184	0	What do you think about the growing suicide rates among Russian teens?	1.3333	0.6667	2.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	1	I think it is horrible !	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	10	What are some ways you think this situation can be ameliorated, both here in the US and in countries like Russia?	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	11	I'm not sure entirely but I hope something can be done	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	12	I think social media companies should be required to offer counseling services to their users, particularly those who are at risk.	0.6667	1.3333	3.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	13	That would be a good start!	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	14	I agree. We should also give children real role models so they do not wind up emulating the vapid ''public figures'' or ''influencers'' they encounter on social media.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	15	I definitely agree with that	0.0	1.6667	2.0	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	16	What do you think were some of the causes of the increased suicide rates among Russian teens?	0.6667	0.6667	2.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	17	Perhaps an increase in anti social behaviors	1.3333	1.0	2.0	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	18	Do you think there could be more complex socioeconomic factors?	0.6667	0.6667	3.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	19	im sure it is a mixture of many different factors	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	2	Would it surprise you to discover that a similar trend is occurring among US teens? The figures are not nearly as high, but there has also been a substantial increase suicides among US teens.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	20	You are probably right. It has been very interesting discussing the article with you. Enjoy your day, goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	21	thank you! goodbye	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	3	That does not surprise me, I have seen it in my own life	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	4	Do you know anyone who has committed suicide?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	5	yes unfortunately I do	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	6	I am sorry to hear that. I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia were directly linked to social media	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	7	I agree, social media can be extremely harmful	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
184	8	The growth in suicides among US teens has paralleled the growing popularity of social media sites, but the two have never been directly linked like the Russian cases. I think awareness should be raised.	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	305.0	35.0	183.0
184	9	Yes I agree. anything that can be done to keep the kids safe	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	305.0	7.0	683.0
185	0	The things you can find on the internet these days.	1.3333	1.0	2.0	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	1	Yeah, this is so scary and sad.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	10	Truly heartbreaking. All that wasted potential. They seem to be getting younger and younger too. I've seen stories of nine and ten year olds taking their own lives.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	11	When my kids were that young I would have never thought that they might be considering such a thing. I feel so bad for any parent that has to deal with it. I can't imagine living after.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	12	I really can't even imagine. What do you think drives the people who are hosting the sites and grooming children like this?	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	13	That's what I was wondering too. Why would you want to convince people to commit suicide? Maybe they are sociopathic and just get a kick out of it, which is utterly disgusting.	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	14	right? it's not like they get anything else from it besides some satisfaction in having a hand in some child's death.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	15	It's really gross.	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	16	I can only hope that the Russian government has been successful in cracking down on sites like this.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	17	Yeah, me too! It's been good chatting with you! bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	18	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	2	How do you think tragedies like this can be averted?	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	3	If they could keep these types of websites shut down. This girl probably wouldn't have done it if she hadn't been exposed to so much online. A 12 year old really isn't thinking it through.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	4	I think an emotional child will always be able to find a place to exacerbate those feelings online no matter how many websites you shut down.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	5	Yeah, but I can also see kids that aren't even depressed, getting immersed in the online community and deciding it would be cool or somehow make them famous.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	6	I suppose anything is possible. Do you think it could have been prevented had her parents known about her online activity?	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	7	I think her parents would have at least had a chance to try to do something. It sounds like they had no idea. What do you think?	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
185	8	I think it's important to at least keep a passive eye on your kids online activity. There's so much toxic stuff out there.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	305.0	25.0	184.0
185	9	Yeah, I agree. Any story like this is so sad. I can't believe that children this young are ever committing suicide. It's just so sad.	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	305.0	57.0	684.0
186	0	Hi there, so I found this to be sad.  It's always so tragic reading about plastic in the ocean and how it's harming wildlife there.  What did you think?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	1	I think we need to do better with our recycling.	0.5	1.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	10	yeah when I lived in a city there was no excuse not to recycle unless you were just lazy.  you just set the container out on the curb.  it's very different here.	0.5	1.6667	2.3333	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	11	I assume there must be some recycling centers though?	0.5	0.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	12	the recycling center IS the landfill, same place you take your trash to	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	13	thats just terrible	1.5	2.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	14	yeah and since it's only open a few days we already have several bags stacked up waiting to go on those days.  we bought cans to put them in outside but you can't have but so much garbage just sitting around outside your house or it starts to attract wildlife.  anyway.  just a difficult situation as far as recycling.	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	15	yeah man and its nobodys fault at that point. IT would be nice to have those places out in rural areas as well.	0.5	2.0	2.3333	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	16	yeah I wish they made it easier.  The trash situation in general out here sucks.  some people pay a service to come pick up their trash but we can't afford that.  so there ya go.  but it is sad about those birds in the ocean.  I bought re-usable water bottles for us so we try to minimize our trash	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	17	I've been using a hydro flask I bought on Amazon for a year now and man its one of the best investments. Keeps my water cold the whole day and no need for water bottles.	0.5	2.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	18	hydroflask?  I will check that one out.  Well it has been good talking to you about this issue.  I hope you have a great rest of your afternoon.  goodbyes	0.5	1.6667	0.6667	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	19	do check it out. bye.	0.5	0.6667	0.6667	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	2	Yes but I don't think that's realistically going to happen.  It's like a problem with no solution.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	3	Lazy people are the problem	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	4	sometimes recycling is very difficult for people.  it's not always as easy as it sounds	1.5	2.0	2.3333	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	5	well most cities make it easier I guess it depends where you're at. My city makes it easy	0.5	1.6667	2.3333	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	6	I live in a very rural area where you have to drive your own garbage to a landfill that is ten minutes or more away and is only open a few hours several days a week	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	7	Yeah what I do is just collect all my beer and soda cans instead of throwing them out and every 6 months or so take them to the local recycling place and they usually pay me around 400  bucks for all the cans. Its a rare case where drinking pays off.	0.5	1.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
186	8	yeah I thought about doing that too.  Part of the problem is our house is already unbelievably cramped and there is literally nowhere to store extra garbage.  we already can barely fit the one garbage can we have.  I have four kids. anyway, not trying to make excuses just saying some cities definitely make it easier	0.5	2.0	2.0	1	299.0	24.0	185.0
186	9	yeah cant really talk about rural areas since I've never lived there	0.5	1.0	1.0	2	299.0	19.0	685.0
187	0	I thought the science behind why the birds eat plastic was interesting.	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	1	"Yeah, I would have never guessed that the plastic gives off the same ""scent"" as food.  Weird."	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	10	"""Needs"" in what sense?"	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	11	"Are you asking what defines my use of the word, ""needs""?"	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	12	I guess I'm looking for specific ramifications from us doing otherwise.  Needs is a strong word.  What exactly will happen if we don't ban plastic straws that makes that action imperative.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	13	Well that is a question that would need to be answered at a different time, as there is waaay too much for this venue, but for starters, banning plastic straws should just be the start.  The plastics and oil industry is probably the most toxic thing to happen to this planet.  Plastics are in everything.  That not only creates pollution in the oceans, kills wildlife and changes ecosystems, but it is the primary contributor to global warming.  Too many people selectively listen to their bought and paid for politicians and lobbyists, and don't buy the conecpt of climate change, but oh well, I'll get off my soapbox	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	14	That's fine, I don't mind listening to people's concerns.  I have my own.  From a practical perspective, do you think there's a WILL to make these changes, even if there's a WAY?	0.6667	2.0	1.0	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	15	Not really.  I think too many people think the change needs to happen from up top, instead of themselves making the change.  I think most people don't understand that we vote/enact change with out wallets, and too many americans are too greedy to have any foresight, and concern themselves with any issue that don't take place in their immediate bubble.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	16	"Yes, I agree with that.  I think convenience is also an extremely big part of it.  I also think few people are willing to take steps ""backwards"" in terms of quality of life, even if they do care about issues like these.  And I think there's another problem, which is that humans have a very hard time appreciating dangers that they've never experienced.  Our brains just aren't very good at imagining repercussions, or taking them seriously, when we haven't experienced those things yet."	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	17	Agreed.  I also think our brains have a difficult time comprehending things that don't occur in our experienced time frames.  Hearing time scales of thousands or millions or billions of years is something most people can't wrap their brains around, so when scientists bring up changes that are occuring, normal people shrug it off as something that will be overcome, or has already happened before.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	18	Yes, as you say, back to our own immediate bubble.  At some point real weather events that directly impact people might prompt some change.  Maybe, I'd be interested to know if people who get wiped out by a hurricane or flooding change their attitudes about environmental stuff, or do even those people not change.  I think that'd be interesting data.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	19	"I live in a hurricane area, and I don't think weather events will change anything.  It'll just be the same narrative.  ""This has always happened"", ""I've seen this before.""  Because even our current crisis of climate change will take place over 50 to 100 years, the effects will not be immediately obviously visible, and people will continue to shrug it off until it's too late."	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	2	I also thought is was telling that all the worst countries in the world at dumping plastic in the ocean are Asian.  They're really bad about that stuff, obviously.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	20	Yes, I think that's a good point.  It's easy to go back to believing everything is normal.  And it might be too late anyway.  Well, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	21	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	3	I think that statistic was misleading though.  From what I understand, they're the largest polluters, because we (the west) ship them all our trash.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	4	Could be.  I think they're attitudes about trash and pollution are different from ours though.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	5	I'm sure.  I think they also can't afford to have the same opinions as us.  In fact, I just remembered how one of those countries, perhaps Indonesia, just shipped back several thousands of tons of trash back to Europe, as they said they were shipped against their wishes.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	6	I wonder if there will be, or can be, any change to the composition of the plastics so they don't give off this sulphurous odor.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	7	I would rather see them change the root cause.  Less pollution.  I think we as americans have been turning a blind eye to these issues too long, and that needs to change.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
187	8	Sure.  I think people are lazy, though, so there will always be a ton of waste since there will always be a ton of consumption.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	299.0	48.0	186.0
187	9	Right.  So maybe we need to get away from one time consumables, and move to products that are biodegradable.  I know that this issue of paper straws, and no plastic bags is mocked quite often, but it's a movement that needs to happen.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	299.0	49.0	686.0
188	0	I was so surprised to learn of yet another way our plastic is harming the environment. What did you think of this study on plastic causing harm to sea birds?	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	1	I was alarmed to learn that they are eating the plastic, but I can not say I was surprised that it is having such a damaging effect on their ecosystem	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	10	Oh yeah? I figure any step is a step in the right direction. I'm pleased to see anyone making any changes that will hopefully continue to grow and make a difference. I'm tired of us doing so much damage to the environment and the animals of this planet. They deserve the right to life as well.	0.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	11	Yes we don't have the right to adversely effect other species. You wouldn't believe me how simple this solution was	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	12	I agree we need to do more. So what was the simple solution?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	13	They just put a large fine mesh net on the outlet of their storm drain so the plastic didn't runoff into the local river. The pictures I saw showed it full of plastic they collected and prevented from reaching the ocean! Amazing, simple, and effective!	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	14	Yes, a great idea and a good way to begin to try and keep more plastic out of our water systems. If everyone did one simple thing perhaps we could be saving our sea life and making the environment better. Proud to see steps taken to make such a difference.	0.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	15	What do you think are some ways we can help reduce plastic waste in the ocean?	0.6667	0.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	16	I believe we need to stop using so many plastic products. Recycle more and make sure that it is being recycled and not just dumped somewhere later. It will take a lifestyle change to do more to make sure that we reduce the need for plastaic.	0.6667	1.6667	3.3333	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	17	I agree that it will take serious life style changes, but I only see the demand for plastic products increasing in the future	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	18	I don't know. I think there is a movement slow though it may be to reduce plastic use. I hope that it continues. I've enjoyed our chat today. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. goodybe	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	19	You are very welcome. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	2	No, I knew plastic was an issue. I just didn't realize that it was this particular issue. Amazing to think that plastic is emitting a scent that is causing birds to eat it. Crazy, amazing and weird how nature works.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	20	bye	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	3	If I remember correctly is was algae coating the plastic that emit the DMS. In any case we have to increase conservation efforts because we are poisoning this planet	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	4	Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic.	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	5	I have seen so many novel ideas to accomplish this, but there does not seem to be any real political will to implement them sadly	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	6	Yeah, I'm amazed at some of the ideas that have been suggested and even put into use. The problem is there is so much ocean and trash already out there and so few people working to clean it up.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	7	I understand it may be a daunting task, but wouldn't it be more manageable if retrieval efforts are concentrated around the shoreline? We know the waste begins its journey on land	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
188	8	I don't know what method would be best. I figure any method that starts the process is a good one. I do know there are large masses of plastic that have been forming out in the ocean and it seems to me finding ways to gather those large groups would be a good start.	0.3333	1.3333	3.3333	1	299.0	44.0	187.0
188	9	I read about a small town that did something pretty simple but effective and it reduced their run off waste by about 90%	0.3333	1.0	2.3333	2	299.0	35.0	687.0
189	0	Hello, pretty interesting article...	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	1	I agree, who knew that is how seabirds hunt.	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	10	True. Some developing and even first world countries see it as their right to grow industry, as we have over the last two centuries, and that they should be able to do what they deemed necessary to grow, just as we have.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	11	I can see their viewpoint, but they should also learn from our mistakes.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	12	Sure, but we have a priviledged position to dictate taht. We can enjoy the advantages of doing stuff the wrong (yet wildly profitable) way, so that we can enjoy that advatage and then set new, more stringent rules for everyone else. I'm not saying they are right in thinking that, but it's hard to argue...	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	13	Like you said earlier, we are rolling back protections and backed out of the Paris accords.	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	14	Yup. It's tough all around. Plus, if we could just end our love affair with red meat, then we could effectively halt global warming - but, I still want the freedom to have a steak when I want one, lol	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	15	I agree, I'm not an impossible burger person. I would cut back if I knew he would truly help my children's future on this planet.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	16	Yeah. I don't eat red meat as much as I used to, but I still do enjoy the taste of a burger and steak. You know, 100 years from now, the world will probably be on a veggie and insect diet, but I want to hold off on eating grasshopper burgers for the time being.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	17	I always envision the movie demolition man where they are eating rats. LOL	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	18	Yeah, lol. It's not that far off. It will probably be insects instead of rats, but, yeah, bascially what we consider vermin and pests will be our main food sources.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	19	A lot countries in Asia already eat rats and insects.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	2	Yeah, I thought that smell would have somehting to do with it, but it's crazy that they are now attracted to plastic waste in the oceans.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	20	yeah. Someday, it will be a thing here, only it will be a hipster eco-trend, like composting and urban gardens.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	21	I would like to see us move away from gas cars.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	22	Oh, that's gonna happen in a big way. Electric is gonna take over, at least in the cities. Self-driving cars will be the norm in cities too.	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	23	I'm scared of self driving cars.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	24	Ha, I hear ya - the thought is unsettling, but no more unsettling than all those bad human drivers out there...	0.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	25	Yeah, but I have never seen a perfect technology. It was nice chatting with you! bye.	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	26	Likewise! I think I have to say it first, then you. so, goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	3	"Do you think we ""human"" are going to change before it is too late?"	1.3333	1.0	2.0	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	4	Well, yes and no. It will be too late for a lot of species, but we'll save ourselves.	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	5	I agree, polar bears and panda are done along with a lot of other species.	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	6	Yeah. And protections for endangered species are being stripped away. Now, I'm not a hardcore environmentalist, I mean, I recycle and all that, but it's pretty hard to ignore the damage being done.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	7	Do you think people who do not believe in climate protection, really believe we are doing nothing wrong or just being blindly selfish?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
189	8	Well, some are very religious and believe that the earth was made to be used up by humans leading up to judgement day.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	299.0	51.0	188.0
189	9	Countries like China are not going to stop polluting anytime soon.	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	2	299.0	30.0	688.0
190	0	Hello what did you think about the article	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	299.0	17.0	189.0
190	1	t	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	10	That's interesting! I don't think i've ever even heard of the word climate change back when i was in school.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	299.0	17.0	189.0
190	11	no me either.  I personally think climate change is just a natural occurrence and data shows it actually has benefits for our planet, but the trash problem is a separate issue.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	12	I'm not sure what can be done to fix that though unfortunately, people will continue to be...people	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	299.0	17.0	189.0
190	13	yeah seriously, and convenience is a huge factor.  not to mention it would take such a major overhaul to eliminate all the plastic.  it's in practically everything	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	14	"Yup, although some countries like China are heading towards the ""green"" direction. I believe they're trying their best to eliminate plastics"	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	299.0	17.0	189.0
190	15	yeah their trash problem is insane though, have you ever looked at pics?  it's disgusting	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	16	True, they really have no choice lol	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	299.0	17.0	189.0
190	17	lol no doubt, it's like filling the streets	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	18	Hopefully this problem will be fixed in the future! It was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	299.0	17.0	189.0

190	3	so did I, am I sorry, I accidentally hit enter and it sent before I could type.  I was going to say that was very sad, what did you think?  I think the amount of plastic in our ocean is ridiculous	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
190	4	Oh it's okay! It's very sad.  I think humans should take more responsibility	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	299.0	17.0	189.0

190	7	me too, i use so many plastic water bottles	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	299.0	24.0	689.0

190	9	I think they will.  they make a big deal of it at my kids' school	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	299.0	24.0	689.0
191	0	I find myself on the fence about this article. While I feel sympathy for those fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries, I also understand Germany not wanting to just open it's doors to everyone. Very much like situations we're facing here in the US at this time. What are your thoughts on the situation?	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	1	I agree, it appears that the system is overburdened as well.	1.3333	1.3333	3.0	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	10	I don't know much about how Canada handles immigration. I do think the problem isn't about immigration though but why the people are leaving their home countries. I feel that efforts need to be made to solve the problems in the countries people are fleeing to help a larger number of people and reduce the burden on other countries like in Germany that are often overwhelmed by those seeking a safer place to live.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	11	I agree. It seems as if there is no clear solution, especially in case hard to prove. The poor Pakistani man probably faces real danger if he returned to his village, but what about another area of the country. Same with the Nigerian.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	12	I agree. The people highlighted in the story seem to have a true need to find safety somewhere else. Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	13	They same could be said for the many Central Americans coming into the US. Although I take issue when the president claims they are rapist and gang members. Most immigrants just want a better life.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	14	I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	15	True, but our system is underfunded and overwhelmed as well. I live in Florida and know a few illegals-they are good people and contribute to my community.	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	16	Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	17	In the case of the illegals I know, they were desperate to provide for their families and so- I guess you're right-they cut in line. But I'm not sure they had a choice. their families were starving.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	18	I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution. Thanks for sharing your thoughts today. goodbye	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	19	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	2	It does seem so. I find it interesting that Germany makes decisions based on where the people are coming from as well. We hear so often how the US is the only country being selective or not wanting too many refugees but everyone is facing similar situations.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	3	Well, I think their priority is war torn countries. The claims are easier to prove.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	4	Perhaps. I think the trouble is there are just too many for any country to take them all. Every story is troubling, but wouldn't it be better to focus on improving conditions in those countries rather than letting everyone leave and overburden other countries?	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	5	OH, I absolutely agree. But, in the case of a small country like Germany-what can they do? It seems we are no longer aligned with out European neighbors, so relying on the US is worthless.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	6	I believe Germany has to do what it can to protect itself first, otherwise how can it help anyone? I feel bad for some of the people talked about in the article, but I can understand why Germany has had to draw some hard lines.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	7	I feel for them as well. The USA has done very little for immigrants. If we could just help the Syrians, maybe the rest of Europe could help other countries.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
191	8	I don't agree that the US has done little for immigrants or anyone else. We can't be the world police. We have our own issues and our own borders are overwhelmed by those attempting to flee Central and South America. I think it is a world problem that the world needs to work on to do better. Helping the war torn countries as a whole. The burden shouldn't fall on any one country.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	313.0	44.0	190.0
191	9	Well, not one country, but countries that have the resources should take on their proportionate share. Canada, for a small country handles immigration rather well.	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	313.0	4.0	690.0
192	0	I feel sorry for all the people who get turned back.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	1	I do too	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	10	I don't like that they play favors with certain countries. The world will be a better place when we see each other as one.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	11	Exactly, just people some people are from certain countries doesn't mean they are bad people	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	12	Hopefully German and the USA will get this right in the future.	0.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	13	Yea this whole thing reminded me of the USA as well, Its disgusting how they treat these children	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	14	I totally agree with you. It is inhumane.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	15	So inhumane and sad	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	16	I think we are in the silent majority.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	17	Yes I think so too, its very strange to me when people support the unfair treatment of immigrants	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	18	Sadly this country, the world, is built on unfair treatment.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	19	Yes it is, every aspect is	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	2	I think the solution is to help their home countries.	0.6667	1.3333	3.0	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	20	Do you have anymore opinions about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	21	No	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	22	Okay, nice chatting with you! bye.	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	23	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	3	Yes that would be ideal, their local authorities should be invovled	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	4	I think people don't realize how bad it has to be for a person to float across the sea on a small boat with 200 other people.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	5	Yes, they are very unsympathetic in the fact that that person had to leave everything behind to try to get into Germany just to be turned away, I couldn't imagine being in a situation like that	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	6	Yeah, it makes me grateful for the things that I have.	0.3333	2.6667	3.3333	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	7	It makes me very grateful as well, I wish that people didn't have to live that way	1.0	3.0	2.6667	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
192	8	me either, some people take joy in seeing other people have less than them.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	313.0	30.0	191.0
192	9	Also, I am sure they probably accept some people that are trying to get into Germany for the wrong reasons, like the economy but don't accept people that are in trouble with the cartel	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	313.0	50.0	691.0
193	0	I think its hard to offer asylum to everyone	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	1	Yea sure . I think so as well	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	10	yeah man the stress must be through the roof	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	11	He has been scared and entered a journey of no return	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	12	The German system has too many loopholes though that must be fixed	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	13	yeah true but there's always a limit to what the system can withstand	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	14	yeah countries can only hold so many people	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	15	if there's no control over the system then the country will lose it value soon	2.0	1.3333	2.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	16	very true	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	17	afghanistan is really in a big mess .I think they have the worse issue at hand	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	18	its just a crazy situation	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	19	yeah	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	2	I cant think of any solution to that problem	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	20	its been a good talk. bye	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	21	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	3	yeah its human nature to always try and cheat the system. i guess that's why there are difficulties now	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	4	The problem needs to be fixed from the root and thats in those countries	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	5	of course. all these cause of unnecessary wars are what drives people away	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	6	yeah the world has always been this way unfortunately	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	7	Hopefully human will evolve	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
193	8	maybe so one can only hope	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	313.0	19.0	192.0
193	9	imagine the man running from his partner's family i really can't imagine the stress he has been through	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	313.0	36.0	692.0
195	0	What did you think about the article	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	1	it was interesting they need to send the refugees back	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	10	they should fix their own country	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	11	yea they need to build it up again so we can bomb it all up I like turning their homes to dust	1.3333	3.3333	1.0	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	12	youre in the air force?	1.3333	0.6667	1.0	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	13	yea	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	14	lol okay	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	15	bomb them to smithereens	1.3333	3.6667	1.0	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	16	back to the article. I think letting a few in is good, not all.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	17	only the christians being killed by the savage towel heads	2.0	4.0	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	18	i doubt they would check based on religion. its germany not some southern american state loll	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	19	they should if they care about terrorism	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	2	yeah what do you think they should do?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	20	been a good talk. bye	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	21	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	3	kick them out	2.0	3.0	1.0	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	4	I agree, Too much  people cant fit in one country. Maybe only take in the serious sad cases	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	5	yea special exceptions but at a bare minimum	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	6	yeah keep it minimum germany is small	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	7	germany is too small	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
195	8	yep way too small for all the asylum seekers	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	313.0	19.0	194.0
195	9	and terrorists	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	313.0	33.0	694.0
196	0	Hey there.  I find it distressing anytime human technology is leading to the death of animals.  It seems so very frequent and common.  What did you think?	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	1	Yes, we certainly have a habit of encroaching on animals' habitats and doing harm to them.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	10	Yeah that is a really good point.  You would think there would be something.  Surely scientists have vetted this out?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	11	I would think so, but maybe it isn't a high priority or something.  I'm guessing the companies with a vested interest in wind farms don't want the bird killing to be paid attention to.  And maybe animal rights groups don't have the resources or something.  Not sure but I personally never hear that much about wind farms, positive or negative.  Energy talk tends to center around oil and coal.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	12	Yeah I don't hear much about it either.  I don't really seek out that info though but I do read the news every day and I never see anything about it.  I have heard about the bird issue just over the years in different settings.  It seems to be an ongoing issue for sure.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	13	"I'd be interested to see how people felt if we just lay all the cards on the table.  Obviously we aren't this knowledgeable, but if we just said, ""These are the pros and cons of wind, solar, oil, nuclear, etc. what do the people prefer?""  In other words, what do you sacrifice?  Dead birds, cost, nuclear fears, Carbon dioxide/global warming, etc.  I'd be interested to see how people chose because, again, you have to compromise somewhere."	1.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	14	Yeah totally.  It's easy for people to sit there and throw out idealistic notions but when it really came down to the practicality of it all and the pros and cons were laid out including cost, what would people choose	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	15	Right.  And I also feel like we, the people, don't get to have that much say.  This is a larger conversation than we have time for, but my energy costs have spiked dramatically in the last few years because the energy company is going towards wind, and it's expensive.  I'm not saying that isn't what I'd ultimately choose, but I don't even get a choice.  I have one utility company and have to accept their monopoly.	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	16	That is a good point as far as not getting any input.  Our costs have gone up too and we only have one company to choose from.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	17	The other thing I'd be interested about is what rodent populations are like around these wind farms.  If you kill all the birds of prey, how does that affect these lands for farming or grazing.  You wonder if land owners, who've agreed to have these wind turbines erected on their lands, will regret it.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	18	Oh yes true, ike the other populations will get out of control.  It could set the entire ecosystem out of balance.  Such is the danger when we tamper with nature.  Well I have enjoyed hearing your insights and hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	19	Yes, it was great chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.0	1.3333	1.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	2	Yes indeed we do.  It's really unfair to them but it's like an inevitable thing as society continues to grow.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	3	Yes, there will always be compromises to be made.  Do we trade more greenhouse gasses for more dead birds, etc.  We're something of an invasive species and will continue to do what we do.  I think the question is just how, precisely, and what we choose to compromise.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	4	Yes I agree.  It seems particularly sad when it is an endangered species that is being compromised.  I did not see anything in the article about what they planned to do to fix the situation, did you?	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	5	"No, I didn't.  They were just talking about using this finding as further food-for-thought for wind farms.  I've also always wondered whether wind farms affect weather patterns.  You can't just take energy out of the air ""for free.""  That affects something.  I wonder if, like this bird situation, we truly understand the ramifications of these wind farms, and whether it's the right alternative energy to be pursuing so aggressively."	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	6	Yeah I agree with what you are saying completely.  It seems like in trying to fix things, there are often unintended consequences that further harm other things.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	7	Yes, and we start down a path without being fully informed about what the ramifications are.  We did the same thing 100+ years ago with coal and oil!	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
196	8	Yeah totally!  And so many other things.  You would think we would have learned our lesson by now but nope.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	398.0	24.0	195.0
196	9	Indeed.  I do wonder if there are specific things they can do to protect the birds, though.  Someone must be thinking of something.  Like, scents that deter them, or colors or something.  I don't know much about birds but you'd think there'd be some way to scare them or deter them from those locations.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	398.0	48.0	695.0
197	0	who knew that wind turbines are killing eagles.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	1	Yes, I had no idea that this was even an issue	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	10	I read an article about the good side of nuclear power.	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	11	Really? I didn't know there was a good side	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	12	it is clean and safe if done right	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	13	That's very interesting	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	14	what do you think is the best power?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	15	Couldn't solar panels produce the same amount of energy	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	16	you need a lot of solar panels	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	17	What do you think is the best kind of power? I read an article that wind turbines cause cancer	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	18	I like natural gas, but it is limited.	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	19	That is true	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	2	It is hard to think about because wind is clean power	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	20	have you ever seen a wild eagle?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	21	Yes i have, they are beautiful. I saw one at a park in NJ. Have you?	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	22	Yes, its scary how big they are	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	23	Yea haha. I have seen a few large birds pick up baby squirrels by my house to eat them. Freaked me out	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	24	I would be freaked out too.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	25	Maybe they can make smaller wind turbines so they don't kill birds	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	26	Yeah, or change the color or been them make a sound the birds don't like	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	27	They are attracted to the wind it creates because it helps them glide better... its like putting sugar out on your counter and not expecting to get ants	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	28	Do you have any other points about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	29	No, do you?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	3	Exactly and it seems like, hopefully, we will head in to that direction to slow down global warming.. i guess you can never win no matter what you do	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	30	No, nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	31	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	4	Yeah, eagles and bats vs everything else.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	5	Because I believe coal fired energy kills birds as well	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	6	I agree. I wonder what are the downsides to solar.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	7	I wonder if they could make something that stops them from coming near the windmills	1.0	1.3333	3.0	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
197	8	I don't know, but that is a good idea.	0.0	1.0	2.0	1	398.0	30.0	196.0
197	9	Yes, there needs to be a way to do something since coal fired energy is probably worse	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	398.0	50.0	696.0
198	0	man, what an article. About the birds, right?	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	1	yeah, really makes you wonder	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	10	well, we're definetly not trying to help the earth, or if we are, its for our own benifit and no one elses, just so we can keep living	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	11	Yeah, it's been a relatively short time that humans have been living on the earth in civilized societies. I can't imagine how long we can continue this without destroying everything.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	12	its troubling. what does life even mean if it can just be wasted, used up on wind turbines or pollution, or green energy, or land deveopment. Just being alive doesn't seem to be worth so much, if it ever was.	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	13	A lot of people probably don't think that way. They just have to have all of the latest and greatest and don't really think about how future generations are going to suffer.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	14	but its us, too. you and me, right now, benifiting form all of it. If you could have the choice between a life of air conditioning, or a living bird, what would you do? We've all already made that choice.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	15	You are right. It would be impossible to live in this society without using these things.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	16	bird would do it to us if they got the chance. If they could have shelter and protection a our expense, they wouldn't care. Life is just so cruel and selfish.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	17	I guess that's true, but the bird doesn't have the knowledge that we do. Maybe they can just figure out a way to put giant cages around the windmills or something so that the birds can't fly into the fans.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	18	or a signal that makes birds avoid it, something only they can hear, but the point isn't about the birds	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	19	Yeah, that would be a good idea.	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	2	wonder what, friend?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	20	its a grain of sand on a beach of utter inhumanity	2.0	3.3333	1.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	21	I'm just trying to look for a little positive. Maybe we can figure out a way to all live happily!	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	22	we can't. i'm running out of tie. bye?	2.0	1.0	1.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	23	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	3	If what we are doing is really improving life on earth	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	4	everything we do harms somehting. Like a bunch of Godzillas crushing everything, indiferrently. If you want to walk ten paes, you have to crush a dozen living things under your stupid feet	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	5	Yeah, but are the wind energy generators something that should be used or not? And there are not that many yet. Have you ever seen areas where they are?	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	6	i have seen these things. They don't seem to be filled with the corpses of dead birds, though.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	7	I'm thinking of the fields of giant windmills. I see them sometimes when I am driving in rural areas. They are massive and each area has many windmills. It seems that they go on for miles. I can't imagine being a bird and trying to navigate that.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
198	8	yes. its troublesome that everything we do, we kill some natural, simple thing. It's not u to me, though, but I guess just by having electricity or whatever I'm complicit.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	398.0	22.0	197.0
198	9	It just really makes you wonder, when we look back on technologies, will we have done the right thing or did we end up damaging the earth more in our efforts to help.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	398.0	57.0	697.0
200	0	hey what did you thin about the article	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	1	I think thats a crazy death to have just flying around and running into a wind turbine	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	10	And they should account for local and migrating birds	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	11	Yeah after that the deaths should lower	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	12	yeah more attention to it would help	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	13	hopefully things do get better	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	14	I think they will as more research is done the technology is newer	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	15	yeah as technology improves so does everything else and this will be no exception	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	16	True we never know the bumps in the road until investigations like this are done	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	17	yeah it must be tested thorougly first	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	18	its been a pleasure talking with you! bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	19	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	2	Same here, they are great sources of energy but I didnt know they were killing machines	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	3	It makes sense since birds also run into windows from houses all the time that they would run into wind turbines	1.0	1.3333	2.6667	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	4	Yeah that is true I wonder if they could do anything to prevent it	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	5	do you think they can do anything to prevent it	1.0	0.6667	2.3333	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	6	Mybe some kind of gate system around them	1.0	1.0	3.0	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	7	yeah or like a chemical sprayed around the area that birds and flying animals are digusted by and fly around because of the smell	1.0	1.0	3.0	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
200	8	Oh thats a really good one! they should use the fine money to come up with solutions	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	398.0	53.0	199.0
200	9	yeah i agree it has to be planned out right	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	398.0	19.0	699.0
202	0	I feel bad for the orangutans!  But this palm oil issue seems to be a very big one in Indonesia.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	1	Yeah I feel bad for them too.  I don't know much about the whole palm oil issue, I found it a little confusing.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	10	But I do think it underscores one challenge we have in these global issues.  Different countries/cultures/economies see the world very differently.  In the west, in our relative prosperity, we focus on certain things.  And in these high-population, low-wealth countries, they focus on much more basic goals.  Sort of like a Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs thing.  The point is, getting everyone to go along with some worldwide issue like reducing greenhouse gases, is extremely difficult if not impossible.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	11	Yeah I agree.  It's like we are on different pages.  So we need to be able to take their perspective before we judge I Guess.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	12	For sure.  I was also wondering about orangutan populations and how bad they actually are.  Not sure where else they live, or if there are healthier populations elsewhere.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	13	Yeah I really know practically nothing about them.  The estimate of how many were dying was really vague, like a very wide range.  I reckon it is hard for them to even know exactly the impact they are having.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	14	That's the other thing with all these issues.  I admit I'm ignorant, but I'm also not sure if I can even trust information and data we get, or for sources to really represent the whole picture.  Everything is so political and narrow.  And we're just bombarded with so many issues and opinions these days.  At some point you just throw up your hands and say, I'm not sure what to think.	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	15	Yeah totally, that is so very true.  And everyone has a bias or a political agenda they are trying to promote, and you can distort facts to sway things a certain way with almost anything.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	16	That's the thing about the internet.  I think people feel they're MORE informed these days, but I'm not sure it's the opposite.  There's just too much information.  I don't think our brains are designed to handle so much.  We can make sense of what we can touch (figuratively) but trying to comprehend this incomprehensibly large planet?  I think it's too much.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	17	Yeah exactly!  And we all have our biases and seek out information that confirms the things we believe and ignore other info.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	18	Yes, I admit that I'm as guilty as anyone.  I cherry pick opinions and stories that corroborate my beliefs.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	19	Yeah I totally do too.  And go to my favorite news sources which are biased towards my beliefs.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you enjoy your day.  bye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	2	Yes, the article sure was.  But apparently Indonesia cuts down forests to grow palm trees to make palm oil.  But the palm oil industry is apparently terrible for the environment in all sorts of ways.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	20	Yes, nice taking with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	3	The whole deforestation thing sounds damaging to me in and of itself.  It seems we should b e protecting forests, not destroying them.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	4	Right, particularly when what they're doing apparently violates an international agreement they're apparently part of.  But it's about economics, so that usually wins out.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	5	Yes, that too.  It seems so damaging on many levels.  I guess their country is pretty impoverished though and this is one of their main economic resources?	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	6	Yes.  So you have the age-old question of what are the rights of mankind and what are the rights of nature?  But also, what is best for mankind's present versus the future?  There's always a compromise, and we usually choose us, and now.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	7	Yeah totally.  I mean I try to put myself in the shoes of people that live there and perhaps that is their only means.  I really don't know enough about Indonesia to say.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
202	8	Yeah, me too.   These are complicated issues.  There isn't some simple, perfect answer or we'd likely have found it.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	31.0	48.0	201.0
202	9	Yeah exactly.  I'd like to think they are doing the best they can and trying to ensure their people survive.  I don't know.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	31.0	24.0	701.0
203	0	That just angers me.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	1	Me, too.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	10	nah, money rules all. money is the root of all evil. someone with money can do that doesnt have to be a big corporation unfortunately money is the key thing here	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	11	What do you think we could do to help them stop?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	12	give sanctions to the country	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	13	That could work	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	14	what do you think should be done to stop them?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	15	I would pay them to make a large part of the forest a national park.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	16	thats actually a good idea as well	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	17	I think that is what they do in Africa for large game parks	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	18	yeah thats true	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	19	have you seen an orangutan at a zoo?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	2	We need to do more to keep these endangered species afloat.	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	20	not really, have you?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	21	Yes, they are pretty cool.	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	22	ive seen lions at a zoo but would like to see an orangutan	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	23	I really like the elephants too.	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	24	they have great memory	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	25	do you have any other opinions about the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	26	not really do you?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	27	No, it was really nice chatting with you. bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	28	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	3	I think they need to pay countries to not harvest their natural resources.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	4	They need to find other ways to go about doing things	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	5	I can not blame them for doing what they are doing because that is what we did.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	6	Orangutans are endangered in that province so  it tends to make people angrier than usual	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	7	Yea, I would hate to lose orangutans	2.0	2.0	3.6667	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
203	8	the risk of fires would increase if sungai putry was drained and deforested so its odd they'd do all that.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	31.0	19.0	202.0
203	9	Corporations rule the environment	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	31.0	30.0	702.0
206	0	hello, how did you feel about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	1	I was so disgusted.  Sorry if you disagree.  I just think going out and looting and acting uncivilized in response to something you disagree with is such a horrible way to respond.  There are many other more mature ways to react.  And as a result, another man is dead.  What did you think?	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	10	i dont mind protesting, just without damaging things	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	11	I think protesting in general is absurd but it is people's first amendment right.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	12	by protesting i dont mean looting and rioting	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	13	yeah it just seems like it usually turns into that.  But a peaceful protest is people's right, I have no problem with that.  I just personally would never waste my time doing something like that.  That's just me.  I don't care if others do.	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	14	i can agree with that	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	15	Anyhow, I'm not really sure that there is a solution to these violent protests.  It seems like it's a fairly common occurrence and it's a huge threat to the communities involved.  When will it end	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	16	im not sure but i hope it comes to an end soon	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	17	Yes so do I.  It seems like harsher punishments would be good but it's hard to arrest and control a humongous rioting crowd.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	18	yeah true that can escalate the violence	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	19	yes exactly, and make things worse	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	2	I agree. it is sad for many reasons	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	20	nice chatting with you, goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	21	goodbye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	3	Yes very much so.  But at the end of the day, the officer reacted in an effort to protect himself and the lives of other officers.  They have a very difficult job and are threatened constantly and have to make snap decisions sometimes.  This was not a racial thing.  The officer himself was African American.  So the reaction of the community was entirely inappropriate to me.  They LOOTED a Hornets store!!!  What on earth.	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	4	I think the looting is awful because it affects innocent shop owners	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	5	Yes, totally innocent people who had nothing to do with this.  Now their store is destroyed.  How on earth is this an appropriate response to being upset about a shooting	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	6	it doesnt make any sense	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	7	No, it's totally illogical.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
206	8	unfortunate that more have to suffer	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	201.0	7.0	205.0
206	9	Yes, very sad and unfortunate.  If you disagree with things that happen int he community you should write your representatives or political leaders and express your feelings	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	201.0	24.0	705.0
207	0	This is certainly a contentious issue.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	1	It is very much. I am afraid we're going to keep seeing it. However, I feel we are only getting half the story and we're only making national headlines about cops shooting people and not people shooting cops.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	10	"Yes, that's the question I want answered.  It's not, ""Why are people getting shot by police?""  It's, ""Why is there a generation of people, and apparently predominantly blacks, who don't think they have to respect the law and law enforcement?"""	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	11	"I'm afraid it's what they are being taught by parents, social media and even music. They are told people are, ""out to get them"" and so they don't have to listen to anyone -- not just cops, but teachers and anyone in authority. It's a sad state of affairs I'm afraid."	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	12	Yes, I think that teachers and principals have largely abdicated their authority and influence.  Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	13	Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	14	Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	15	"It is. It's like everything in society now, though. We have gone to the extreme to avoid upsetting anyone or offending anyone. Doesn't anymore remember the old saying, ""You can't please all of the people, all of the time!"" Suddenly, everyone thinks they get to always have their way no matter what because otherwise, I'm offended!"	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	16	Yeah, it's just crazy.  Even the people who believe that's how it should be can't help offending people.  There's always someone who's going to be offended.  We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	17	It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	18	Absolutely.  And the ultimate irony is that by trying to make everyone's life struggle-free, we increase their struggles by making everyone less capable of dealing with them.  We know it's unhealthy and unproductive to treat kids like this, make them soft and feeble.  It's not just silly, it's actually detrimental to the people we're trying to protect.	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	19	Exactly! Instead of letting them learn when they're young and the disappointments are more minor that they can survive not always getting what they want. We let them grow up thinking everything should go their way. Then suddenly, they don't get into the college they want or get the job they want and they can't deal with it.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	2	Yes, I like to say that just because a story is true, doesn't make it representative of the country as a whole.  If the news decided to run stories about kidnappings, they could very easily have the country go into a panic over that.  We get just the slightest sliver of a glimpse of the country through the news, and it skews our perspective.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	20	Yeah, it's a bizarre tack we've taken and I wonder when it or if we'll change course.  Anyway, it was great talking with you.  I really enjoyed it.  Hope you have a great day.  bye	0.0	2.6667	1.0	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	21	Was great chatting with you as well. Enjoy your day. goodbye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	3	I totally agree. We tend to see the media picking and choosing what they focus on. We don't even get a fair representation of happenings. Instead, we get a skewed view to press a political hot button and not giving a fair understanding of the incidents.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	4	Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	5	I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	6	Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens.	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	7	I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
207	8	Yeah, precisely.  I also ask myself in these issues, how much danger do we expect these cops to put themselves in?  How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do.	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	201.0	48.0	206.0
207	9	I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media.	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	201.0	44.0	706.0
208	0	man, that was more than an article. Like several mashed together, but. It really makes you empathetic, don't you think?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	1	yeah i agree.	1.0	1.3333	2.6667	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	10	and this stuff has been going on forever. its just not being reported.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	11	its just we now have social media and it becomes more known	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	12	yeah. people have power, but its just more surveilance. its like they tricked us into being walking video amerasso we have no privacy, anyone can moniter anyone anymore. i just wished the innocent black kids and adults wouldn't have to get blown away by rednecks	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	13	well the only good thing is people know its a problem now at least thats the first step	0.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	14	yes. i'm somewhat hopeful. but we're so complacent in usa. we know more about it, but the system is so ingrained, its hard to overcome	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	15	after reading the article you cant help but feel urgency	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	16	urgency, and also emotions. for the slain. the impoverished, and the bullied.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	17	no doubt about it	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	18	crazy low IQ militarized force, no consequences for what they do. itsgetting to be more and more militarized. We're losing the battle for our own rights	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	19	were all being trained to be slaves by the government	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	2	people are ddying in the streets. Being slaughtered. Sad is that so many people like it this way.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	20	hell, yeah, brother. you know whats up	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	21	its the only conclusion	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	22	is that ten turns yet?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	23	was a good talk. bye	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	24	bye	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	3	gun control is needed	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	4	my solution: all handguns are illegal. You can own two guns by law, eithe a single shot rifle, or a single shot shotgun. No more than those weapons, and only one of each. that's my gun control. will you support it if i write it in a bill?	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	5	that probably a good idea you cant go on a shooting spree with a single shot	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	6	its too common sense, though. it would never work	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	7	common sense never gets passed into law	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
208	8	no. all cops should not have guns either. they ahould be trained tode escalate stuff. not just shoot. people like it htough. they like innocent peoplebeing killed they watch too much tv	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	201.0	22.0	207.0
208	9	theyre not trained enough period	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	19.0	707.0
211	0	This whole situation just sucks.  I can see things from both parties perspectives.  I hope it gets cleared up without any casualties.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	1	I completely agree with you, neither side is purposefully trying to hurt the other. It seems that the oil people would have more resources to figure something out than the Native Americans.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	10	"Yeah I don't remember verbatim, but that's basically what was said.  ""Around 150 Native Americans and protestors"", or something like that.  It reminds me of when there was that huge backlash against the Washington Redskins, and that name being derogatory.  But over 95% of Native Americans polled said they didn't care, and many schools in reserves were named the Redskins... Just interest groups deciding to be upset about something."	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	11	If that is the case though, even more sad for the Native Americans that are being used by the activists and getting hurt in the protests.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	12	True.  Either way you look at it, Native Americans have been getting shit on in this country for like 500 years.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	13	So true.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	14	I guess with that being said, maybe I am more in favor of them changing the pipeline somehow.  Even if there is just a small chance of leaking, maybe the NA's have been f'd with enough.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	15	If there is a way to do it and avoid going through that land, that might be the best thing to do.	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	16	Yeah.  I wonder if any of the oil bigwigs have discussed that at all, or if they're just planning on ompletly muscling these people, knowing they have the support of the Government.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	17	I would think the protests might have them thinking a little about it at least. But I think it said the land was owned by the federal government, but the Native Americans thought they had some right to it because of some treaty.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	18	If I remember correctly, the land itself is owned by the government, but the problem would be if the the pipeline burst.  If that happened, oil would seep into the groundwater, and pollute the (sacred) lake that the NA's use.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	19	That makes sense. It seems that there should be a way to make it safe so that the Native Americans are ok with it. And it could help them get jobs too.	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	2	So you're saying the oil people should move the pipeline, or determine some other means of remedy?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	20	That's true.  That would be a good olive branch.  Not only would they have jobs, but also maybe have an opportunity to ensure that the pipe is done well, and minmize any chance of pipe failure.	0.0	2.3333	3.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	21	That is a great idea!	0.0	3.0	1.6667	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	22	It would probably just be an issue of whether they have any of the qualifications.  I'm sure at least the labor jobs they could assist.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	23	It's been great talking to you!	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	24	same to you!	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	25	bye!	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	26	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	3	I just think that they might be able to figure something out. They probably have a lot more resources and money.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	4	That's probably true.  Divert it somewhere.  I wonder what the costs would be though?  We'll probably never know.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	5	I feel horribly for the Native Americans though. This seems to really be threatening their way of life.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	6	Possibly, whenever I see how the article states there are native americans, and protestors, it makes me wonder how much of this is a feigned movement by radical lefters.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	7	Yeah, like the MAGA hat kid story	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
211	8	Exactly.  I hate to get like this, but I don't trust a word from the media anymore.  They'll frame anything to get the point across that they want to.	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	273.0	49.0	210.0
211	9	Totally agreed! And I had not read the article closely enough. I thought the Native Americans were protesting themselves. I didn't realize they were there with the environmental activists.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	273.0	57.0	710.0
212	0	macing elders is never good	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	1	True. but I dont believe one should be above the law	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	10	yeah i wonder why	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	11	I wonder if it had to do with the media hype of the protest and they expected more backlash. not sure	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	12	probably. fox news tends to overblow things	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	13	Thats the truth, I mean yea, they needed to be cleared, but the aggressiveness of the round up was too much	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	14	maybe they can learn from this as a police department	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	15	That should definately be looked into as a state training. because it wasnt just one dept that rounded them up	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	16	i feel cops need to be trained more in all states	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	17	I dont think its all police but there has been a uptick in fresh recruits and I think that the new recruit in this day and day are not properly trained to handle situtations	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	18	most cops are great but the bad ones ruin it for the rest	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	19	I agree it casts a shadow that is really hard to get out of esp.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	2	im with the protestors here we already took enough of the native americans land	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	20	yeah with youtube and phone cameras its tough	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	21	Our local dept all have cameras. But I really like the fact they have live PD and things like that. But social media has made the job way harder, because you only hear 1 side of the story	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	22	live PD is a great show. Yeah, cop body cameras are great but I feel like they can be better	0.0	1.6667	2.0	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	23	I think the mouths of the officers on the show need to be better, but I know if a cop told me stop or be shot, I would be stopping	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	24	the problem is a shot being a cops first option instead of something less lethal. esp when the suspect has no weapon	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	25	That is very true.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	26	yeah i always wondered why theyre trained that way	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	27	I believe its because the one time you dont, it can cost you your life. But one life is not greater than another	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	28	i agree with that. its been a great talk i enjoyed it. bye	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	29	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	3	true but there are other forms of protest.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	4	what about the protest rubbed you the wrong way?	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	5	The protest itself didnt rub me the wrong way. the way the police handled it wasnt prob not the greatest esp when they shot the horse	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	6	yeah i didnt see them do anything wrong but the police on the other hand..	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	7	I agree that it was handled in a very wrong manner, and the police officers showing up in the riot gear was interesting	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
212	8	riot gear to fight the tough elderly people i guess	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	273.0	19.0	211.0
212	9	it felt like they went there expecting a fight.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	273.0	0.0	711.0
213	0	I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate articles in their personalizd inboxes in ways that relate to them through working means, and however as mTurk workers working remotely sometimes our means to relate are removed, and this relates to this message I received from this article.	1.5	3.0	1.3333	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	1	What do you mean?	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	10	I don't really get it at all. I'm completely lost on your point and the article and mine now.	1.5	2.3333	1.0	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	11	well thats fine as long as you keep talking we need more responses	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	12	There's violence in the world and there's things happening! I want to get out there and do something.	1.5	3.3333	1.6667	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	13	I want the world to burn	2.0	3.0	1.0	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	14	That would be really odd, don't you think?	1.5	1.6667	0.6667	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	15	I suppose but its better then this	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	16	I don't know about you, but I can live in the moment, but I wouldn't freely attend a protest that could somehow support polluting the environment	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	17	The environment is not important I like to litter and throw the plastic that keeps 6 pack cans into lakes and other bodies of water	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	18	I'm trying to say that a protest could somehow support polluting. What are you trying to say?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	19	I'm saying don't protest anything	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	2	I mean that if I were ordering through a produce app on my smart phone, because I work remotely online as a contractor, my personlized internet of things will probably make it so that I don't even know the farmer or where the goods come from or whatever.	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	20	"I'm trying to say that I'm confused that we are supposed to talk about the article, and you seem to say don't talk about it. Am I reading that right? I was also trying to say that the checks and balances in place in society keep things from happening like this, and it strikes me as odd that it just ""randomly"" happens"	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	21	I suppose but we have our 10 responses so lets say goodbye	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	22	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	23	1	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	24	bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	3	Yes but how is this related to the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	4	Like there are ladders in place in society that keep everything in check, and somehow by working more incorporated (in my opinion) we have lost the ladder? Did they spill into the water supply in cohort with the protest? These are things that can make sense in order to bring a light to us stuck on the edge, but I don't see the relation and what it means to us.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	5	I'm glad they shot that kids horse though	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	6	If you don't bring anything from the article like that into the light then what.	1.5	2.0	1.0	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	7	I don't know but just go along with it write short sentences and have 10 responses back and forth	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
213	8	Like that makes sense if this is supposed to be a how to discussion guide on how to relate to workers anywhere, but then what about the ladder they removed that allowed them to spill.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	273.0	15.0	212.0
213	9	I think protests are dumn	2.0	2.3333	1.0	2	273.0	33.0	712.0
214	0	hi what did you think?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	1	I feel sorry for the people, but I don't think these protests are appropriate at all.  They were trespassing on private land and blocking public roads, throwing rocks at officers and shooting a gun at them.  That is totally unacceptable.  There are other ways to express yourself if you disagree with something.  What did you think?	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	10	these kids are hypersensitive	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	11	yes they are.  entitled and it is irritating.	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	12	its the worst everyone is a victim	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	13	yes, all these protestors.  they grate my nerves so much and cause way more harm than whatever it is they are protesting	2.0	4.0	1.3333	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	14	blocking roads so ambulances can't get through	2.0	3.0	1.3333	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	15	right!  or people can't get to work or to pick up their kids or whatever.  so selfish	2.0	4.0	2.3333	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	16	yea people have lives not like the protestors	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	17	yes, and things that matter to them, too.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	18	exactly nice chatting with you bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	19	you too!  bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	2	yes I hate protesters they need a job who has time to do that? sorry I'm in a hurry have to go shopping	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	3	I really hate them too.  We can do fast, no worries!	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	4	thanks I love the environment and all but there are limits	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	5	yeah no doubt.  contact your congressman or something	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	6	exactly people need jobs too	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	7	yes!!!  who has time to be out doing all this mess?  it blows my mind	2.0	3.6667	1.3333	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
214	8	I feel like the world is just getting crazier	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	273.0	33.0	213.0
214	9	I do too, and people have a victimhood mentality.  they provoke things they cry victim	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	273.0	24.0	713.0
216	0	I thought about this in a while. Really makes you think about all the tragedies that newer stuff just pushes out of the way	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	1	Yes, we have short memories now.  One tragedy or threat or whatever replaces another with great speed.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	10	boston bombing. somehting like that. It gets scary to see the reaction of militarized force to thos ehtings. I don't want to live in a country like that. But I don't know about being due, I don't think this stuff happens a lot of the time, and when it does it isn't preventable even more of the time, it's just the response the draconia militarization that comes aftwerward creating the illusion of safety	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	11	I was in Washington D.C. after 9/11.  It was always eerie driving past the Pentagon and other areas and seeing humvees with guided missiles pointing to the sky.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	12	people seem so eager to lose that freedom if you pretend they're safe. Terrorism in america, when we're not talking about mass shooters is nearly nonexistent, but we still need tanks in the street for some reason.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	13	Yeah, I find with a lot of these issues that we lose perspective.  The world becomes so small when we distill it down to extreme events and watch it on a screen.  But the world is incomprehensibly large.  This country is.  A state is, even a city.  I'm sure right now a lot of parents are sincerely worried about sending their kids to school.  The reality is that they're more likely to win the lottery than ever experience someone they love getting killed in a mass shooting.	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	14	exactly. But fear is a great manipulator. People are taken advantage of, told constantly that they're going to be in danger so they can watch more tv, or buy whatever, or vote a certain way, and it just creates chaos.	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	15	"Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or even an improvement.  We seem hell-bent on running towards a world of greater and greater manipulation.  We joke about ""1984"" and that type of dystopia and yet we can't put down our phones."	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	16	its hard for a lot of people, i understand that. You get like postive rewards, doepamine or whatever in a constant rush by seeing whats on your phone. It all goes hand in hand, tools of addiction, manipulation, fear. You don't want to trust anyone, everyone's a serial killer, or a rapist pedophile, or a terrorist, and if you talk about love or empathy, or trust, you're a weak retard who lives in a fantasy world. I can change myself, but by and large this is the way people are being shaped as a whole. I feel despondent or whatever.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	17	Yeah, it's hard.  But I think that feeling of despondency is probably shared by many people, in various ways and for various reasons.  We see too much of the world now.  We recognize our own futility and insignificance and impotence more than ever.  I think our brains are designed to live in smaller worlds, worlds we feel in more control of.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	18	i thinkthat's true	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	19	I agree.  I also think what I said is true.  Maybe.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	2	i thnk that we're just bombarded with new information about everything that it just becomes a list ofstuff that's horrible after a while	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	20	this is a good chat, but we're in too deep and my repoies are taking up too much time. You seem like a classy individual, thought. bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	21	Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	3	Yes, I worry at what point we collectively stop caring.  Is the world a better place because I learn about some school bus that crashes in some part of the world I know nothing about?  That sounds callous but the world is incomprehensibly large.  We can't concern ourselves with the fate of all 7 billion people.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	4	callus is right. The more we go on learning of this stuff, it builds up like a callus, or it eats so far into you. bad to say, but it feels like if a certain number of people don't get murdered, then its not worth my attention. that's horrible	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	5	One thing in the story that stuck out to me was the band that played the show that got attacked.  I'd feel awful for the rest of my life if that had been my band.  People came to MY show.  I WANTED them to come to MY show.  And they ended up dead or traumatized because of it.  I'd feel devastated by that.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	6	yeah. i didn't even consider that. they were there to see them. the reason for showing up. Damn.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	7	The response of France also sounded a lot like a U.S. response to a similar event.  The government claims more power to insure safety.  Backlash against Muslims increases for a time.  People mourn.  It could have been America after 9/11.  My point is, people are largely people, even though other countries like to paint the U.S. as different.  Of course it is in ways, but we're also just all people.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
216	8	stuff gets taken advantage of. People's lives get turned into politcal tools by the charasmatic sociopaths who govern us. Its in a lot of people's interest to drive us apart. It's like in in prince machevelia or somehting.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	247.0	22.0	215.0
216	9	"Yeah, I agree.  There's a lot of that.  Apropos your original point, I sort of can't remember the last time a Western country had one of these events.  (I'm not including the ""domestic terrorism"" of mass shootings in the U.S.)  I wonder if we're due, or if it's a sign the terrorists are losing or we're just getting really capable at preventing this stuff."	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	247.0	48.0	715.0
217	0	I feel bad for the father in the article.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	1	what do you think can be done to prevent these attacks	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	10	The cartoon drawing of Muhammad	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	11	if that was the reason they attacked I think one shouldnt mess with peoples religions so it was not the right thing to do.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	12	I agree. I think attacking is too far, but you should not play with someones religion. Plus the people at the concert did not do the drawing.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	13	yeah its like youre taunting them to do it	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	14	I agree with you.	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	15	most of the time in these things innocent people die which is terrible	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	16	I also did not like how people blame the actions on all Muslims.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	17	yeah it tends to happen which is bad	2.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	18	I believe in God, but I try not to get too religious	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	19	i myself believe in god but never go to church dont think its needed	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	2	Sadly nothing. There are too many people to control everything. What do you think?	2.0	3.0	1.3333	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	20	Sadly some people go to church every Sunday but still do not have love for everybody.	2.0	3.6667	1.0	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	21	most of the disrespectful people ive met go to church every sunday	2.0	3.0	1.0	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	22	I said that to my mom and she told me heavy sinners need to go to church the most. I couldn't argue with her.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	23	thats actually a good quote bro. its been a good talk enjoyed it. bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	24	You too. bye	0.6667	1.3333	0.3333	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	3	its tough I have no idea either	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	4	It would break my heart to find out my child died on social media.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	5	cant imagine what they went through	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	6	I'm glad he said he was finding some peace in the things he was doing to honor his daughter	0.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	7	Thats true one can only hope that peace stays forever	0.0	3.0	2.0	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
217	8	Do you think publishing the cartoon was the right thing to do.	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	247.0	30.0	216.0
217	9	can you elaborate? dont think I read about that in the article	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	247.0	19.0	716.0
221	0	man, what an article. I mean, really.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	1	I had a black lab mix once and so I felt sad thinking about her dying.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	10	I don't want to do that because I'm a good person. I don't have a lot of concern for dead animals though. They're basically replacable. Disposable. I'm sure the woman felt bad for a week, maybe, then got a cool new puppy.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	11	Yeah, but there are practical concerns, like having to think up a new name for the puppy.  That's sort of an unnecessary burden, it seems.	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	12	Yeah. I guess? ? That guy that shot the dog, though. I feel the worst for him. He's definetly going to shoot a family member or friend by accident.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	13	Do you feel sorry for him because of what you think he'll feel after he does that?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	14	Sorry he's such a friend moron he goes around armed. Sad for the person he's going to maim or kill. No winners here.	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	15	I see.  Yeah, I guess I sort of don't understand the mentality of a guy like that, so I'm not sure I understand the situations when he'd use his gun.  I thought the most peculiar sentence in the article was when they said they walked by the two dog owners and one of the people (presumably the wife) apologized for their loss.  That just seemed wildly strange and ironice.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	16	Sounds like a person going through the motions of saying somehting they don't mean, ust to be polite or whatever.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	17	Absolutely.  I think that's right.  But it's so unbelievable, why bother to even say it.  I'm sort of surprised the dog owner didn't lose her mind.  Maybe she was scared of getting shot herself.  And she was also focused on her dying dog, of course.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	18	She was for sure afraid of this clint eastwood wannabe putting some holes in her. She's probably gonna have therapy after seeing that. Or maybe she doesn't even mind anymore,. what do i know?	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	19	I saw a woman's child get run over by a car once.  The child was lying in the street (long story) and the car's tire went right over its abdomen.  The woman's first instinct was not to check on her child, who was still under the car, but to bang on the guy's windows to complain.  I thought that was interesting.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	2	was it shot in front of you?	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	20	I think getting mad is a normal reaction. If you can blame someone for somehting, then its like it takes the burden off of you somehow, it's like you don't have to be in control, or take resposibility if you can just blame it all on someone else, even if it was there fault or whatever.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	21	I agree, but I would have thought her motherly instinct would have been to focus on the child first.  Apparently not.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	22	if you're not a in control, take charge type, you can just say look at what you did, you did something wrong, you fix it. You pay for it, because its beyond my control.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	23	Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	24	Right on brother, keep on trucking. lol bye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	3	No, but I could relate to the idea of losing a pet unexpectedly.  Have any of your pets or children or family members ever been shot in front of you?	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	4	A close friend was murdered. But it wasn't in front of me. lol.	1.0	3.0	2.3333	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	5	Well that's good news.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	6	I thank God every day.	0.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	7	As for the story, I sympathize with the woman but I also think it's unacceptable to have your dog off the leash like that.  I'm not saying the guy needed to kill it, but I find it wholly unacceptable to expose people to uncontrolled dogs, especially in environments where they're not allowed to be off their leashes.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
221	8	yeah. Keep your dog on a leash. Being a pet owner is responsibility. But also, it's so stupid people can just walk around strapped like its the wild west, looking to blow something away.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	417.0	22.0	220.0
221	9	It certainly makes you think about those times when you want to tell someone off or flip someone off.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	417.0	48.0	720.0
222	0	In my opinion, the man was totally within his rights.  That dog should have been on a leash plus the owner failed to restrain it when it attacked him.  I'm fed up with people being inconsiderate of others and having unleashed dogs in public places that endanger the safety of others.  What if it had been a child?	2.0	4.3333	2.3333	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	1	Yeah, I do agree that it is annoying when people don't follow the rules and just let their unleashed and very bad dogs in a park. I have left parks before because I have 2 small children and do not want unleashed dogs around them	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	10	Yeah exactly, and that's exactly what this dog is.  It has really damaged our relationship because we can't bring our kids around them anymore.  My sister doesn't even have kids and she doesn't feel comfortable going over there either.  Crazy.  Picking a dog over family.	2.0	4.0	1.6667	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	11	Yep, as soon as my in laws got their last dog they don't even baby sit anymore and just go googly eyes over a silly dog, kind of weird. They should want to see the grand babies	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	12	yeah exactly!  it's insulting.  But anyway, it is what it is.	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	13	It is! I would think when I have grand children I would want to see them as much as possible. I was reading up and dog people are freaking out that the guy didn't get charges pressed against him. Face palm	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	14	Oh I bet they are outraged!!  I was totally expecting to get a dog person defending the man with this HIT and dreading the ensuing conversation.  I would want to see my grandchildren and would easily re-home any pet that was standing in the way of that.	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	15	Well when i first read it i thought the dog was just playing around and the guy was just shooting the dog because he had a few screws loose but then i looked up the article somewhere else	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	16	that was a good idea.  I guess I am already slightly biased against dogs bc of the issue with my parents, plus I am always reading about dogs that killed some innocent child or baby.  It breaks my heart.  I know dogs make great pets for some people and I support that but just be responsible and considierate.	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	17	Yea I am kind of in the middle, I know some people are violent against dogs for no reason and that is not acceptable but the dog was definitively going to attack that man.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	18	I agree with you that if it is for no reason that is unacceptable.  It is also tragic to read about inncoent dogs being abused or hurt by cruel sick people.  Well thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, I have enjoyed our conversation.  Have a great day.  goodbye	1.6667	3.6667	1.3333	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	19	Thank you, you too!	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	2	Same here.  I have three small children and a teen and I don't want aggressive unleashed dogs around any of them.  Not to mention, and this is less serious, but we had to leave a park just recently bc someone's dog was pooping everywhere and they were just leaving it.  My toddlers could crawl into that and get it on their hands.  Disgusting.  So inconsiderate.	2.0	3.6667	1.3333	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	20	thank you!  I think you have to type in goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	21	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	3	Yes, I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old, its enough having to watch them around water since we live by the beach. People just let their dogs go unleashed all the time and then they run towards my children and you don't know if these dogs are up to date on their vaccinations either	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	4	Oh yeah, that's totally unacceptable.  I just feel like people should be more considerate about their pets and other people.  Just have them on a leash and clean up their waste, plus take them into non-trafficked areas when they need to go.  The article also doesn't even mention the breed of the dog, I don't think, not that it really matters.  It was uncool regardless.	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	5	I looked up the article and it was a very big black lab. Also the dog was dancing around the man, so it was going to attack him	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	6	Yeah, I would have been scared myself.  You just never know with a dog.  I read things in the paper all the time about attacks.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we don't even go to their house anymore because of it.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	7	I have a German Shepard, she is so sweet and is scared of her own shadow but she is never allowed to be alone with the kids. My in laws have 3 (very bad) dogs and they scare me and they are a forth of the size as my dog	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
222	8	Theirs is a specially trained attack Czech german shepherd.  It aggressively barks at anyone who approaches it (that is not them) and has issues.  It recently chewed up the wiring on its crate so badly that its teeth were broken.	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	1	417.0	24.0	221.0
222	9	Yea that is terrifying. Police dogs are known to attack children too, just because they are trained to kill basically	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	417.0	50.0	721.0
223	0	I blame the dog owner for the dog's death.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	1	She is definitely partially at fault for not keeping her dog on a leash like she was supposed to but at the same time i am unsure if there is really any blame to pass around. All i know is i feel awful for her.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	10	Yeah, she knew she could not really blame the guy for shooting the dog	0.3333	2.0	3.0	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	11	For sure, but once she comes to terms with not blaming him i hope she does not start to blame herself in anyway.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	12	I do not think she needs to become depressed, but it was mainly her fault	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	13	Yeah, hopefully the only think that comes of this is everyone moves on in their own way.	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	14	I agree. I really don't think her dog was going to bite him, but was just an excited dog.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	15	Yeah most likely just a playful dog. I think if they dog were going to bite it would have lead with barking or given a sign. I wonder if the man has had any bad experiences with dogs in his life that caused him to react.	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	16	Yeah he could had just been afraid of dogs	1.6667	1.3333	3.0	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	17	Thats what i was thinking yeah.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	18	Do you have any pets?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	19	Not anymore but i have had dogs before, never big ones like the woman. Have you?	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	2	I feel bad for the dog and her, but I can not blame the man for shooting the dog	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	20	I used to but my dog died of old age.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	21	Better way to go than the one in the story that poor thing. Feels like losing your best friend.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	22	Do you have anymore comments about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	23	No i don't think so.	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	24	nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	25	Likewise, goodbye.	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	3	I can't blame him either, the way i see it is this is just a sad accident.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	4	Yeah, what do you think about the rules of park?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	5	I think the rules are perfectly fine, they are clear about no animals of their leashes. Do you think anyone should have been charged or fined?	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	6	No, I support the right to bear arms, but I can not see myself carrying a gun everywhere	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	7	I agree he was well within his rights and he probably really felt threatened. I could not either but i definitely understand people who do. If i was the owner i don't think i would be able to get another dog after that though.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
223	8	It would take me a long long time to get another dog.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	417.0	30.0	222.0
223	9	Definitely, i hopefully the owner is able to find peace. At the end of the article it seems like she is coming to terms with it being an accident	0.0	3.0	2.6667	2	417.0	23.0	722.0
224	0	I found the article ot be a sad overall story	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	1	I too find it that way and annoyed at the claim of the Gun user	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	10	I dont mind responsible gun use, but I do not like going to far on the other side like some do and refuse to consider any gun regualtion laws	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	11	agree with you on that. by chance do you have a dog pet?	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	12	Not now, just a cat, but have in the past.  Losing one is like losing a friend	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	13	oh sorry about you loss. are indeed a great companion. i have a thing for cats as well but don't have one as a pet yet	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	14	Both are interesting pets to have for different reasons	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	15	yeah ..very true	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	16	Do you have any dogs?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	17	yeah. i own a german shepherd dog	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	18	Very nice, those are good dogs	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	19	Yeah.. its nice discussing with you on this topic	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	2	It seems like many others things could have been done by the other person	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	20	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	21	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	3	Yeah and not just concluding to just kill the dog	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	4	Granted the others person broke a leash law, but the death of their pet should not be the punishment for that	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	5	You are right. i can't imagine losing such a companion	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	6	The person should be fined severly and lose his conceal and carry permit/liscence for that.	1.6667	4.0	2.6667	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	7	I wonder if he can murder an individual on such a claim	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
224	8	Exactly, hypothtecially if a shady looking person walks up to him in a park to ask for change, would he have gotten away with shooting them as a precaution?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	417.0	41.0	223.0
224	9	personally i am not a fan of guns	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	417.0	36.0	723.0
225	0	I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  For starters, the dog owner should have had her dog on a leash.  She then failed to respond and react when the man repeatedly asked her to restrain her dog.  So he acted to try to defend himself and this is the result.  I find dogs to be highly threatening and can totally understand his actions in this case.  How did you feel about it?	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	1	I agree with you we need to kill more dogs	1.3333	3.0	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	10	yeah that's kinda gross.  But I guess a cultural thing.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we dont' even go over to their house because of that stupid dog	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	11	Yea it is kind of weird would you eat a dog in a survival situation? like walking dead	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	12	I really don't know.  I guess if I were going to die otherwise I would.  Would you?  I'm kinda picky about meat so this is disgusting to think about.	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	13	I guess if I had to I would if it was a choice between a dog and people Ill pick the dog lol	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	14	well yes certainly.  Hopefully it never comes to that.  I do find it a bit alarming that people in countries like Korea or wherever are like breeding dogs just to eat them.  That is foul.  Anyway,	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	15	haha that is foul I grew up in the hood and that shit is foul	1.0	3.0	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	16	Yes it is totally not okay.  Anyway, maybe there should be some restrictions on dogs people are allowed to own.  I would get behind that.	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	17	dogs should be banned unless used to hunt other animals	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	18	I don't really like dogs so I could get behind banning dogs altogether, too.  I doubt that will happen though.  Well it has been great discussing this with you but I must go.  Have a great rest of your day, goodbye	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	19	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	2	What do you mean, like euthanize dangerous dogs?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	3	Yes I personally don't understand why people need to keep violent dogs like pit pbulls	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	4	OMG thank you, I so strongly agree.  Literally about every week I see a case in the paper where an innocent child or baby or even adults is attacked and killed by some pit bull.  I don't understand how these things are not illegal.  And why do people want them?  IT's a safety hazard and unfair to other people.  It scares me that pit bull owners could move in next door and totally threaten my children's lives and mine.	2.0	4.0	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	5	I hate it when the babies get hurt	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	6	it's totally unacceptable.  If you want a dog, fine, but get a calm family dog that is appropriate and not aggressive or violent.  And keep it on a leash.	2.0	3.3333	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	7	Yea you should have a fence	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
225	8	yeah that should be a legal requirement if you're going to have a dog	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	417.0	24.0	224.0
225	9	yes in china they eat the dogs	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	417.0	33.0	724.0
226	0	Migration of species always seems to create some sort of problem.	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	1	it does and in this case our intervention seems to have made it worse	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	10	Yeah, I don't mind frogs.  I see them when I go for walks at night and they sometimes scare me because they look like rocks on the road and then they shockingly start moving.  But of course they're just frogs.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	11	frogs bring so many good memories for me, when i was a kid and our area would get flooded after rain, we would catch these small fish but only later did i get to know that those were not fish at all	0.0	3.3333	1.6667	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	12	That's a great childhood memory.  I used to catch little fish in tide ponds, although they were real fish.	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	13	thinking of this story though, there are those other deadly diseases that we got from the other animals but now they are killing us too	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	14	Yeah, I think we forget that we're part of the whole natural world and are subject to all these things as well.  This is what happens to species.  They're exposed to new things and they adapt or die.  We're better at adapting to things, but we're still part of that system.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	15	And we are mostly running the system but sometimes it just feels that we can never won, there is always some new virus or bacteria that nature throws at us and we start from ground zero again and again	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	16	Yeah, there will always be something that crops up and threatens us.  And at the same time we're worried about other species too.  We've certainly got a lot of balls in the air.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	17	Someone I know recently got sick with one of those superbugs and barely survived. I keep thinking to what will be the future like when those become the norm than the exceptions in hospitals	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	18	Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, those bugs are scary.  But we haven't succumbed to any major pandemic or epidemic in a while.  So I just have no idea what the likelihood of any of these bugs wiping out major portions of the population are, like Spanish flu and the plague once did.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	19	Probably very low since we do have some defense even for those. Plagues of old time were just so bad and humans helpless as they did not understood they causes of what was happening and why	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	2	Yeah, that's pretty typical.  I think we're usually pretty responsible for this type of thing.  Invasive species, habitat destruction, etc.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	20	Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	21	you too. goodbye	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	3	even with the best of intentions like here, we just end up doing more bad than good	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	4	"I thought the end of the article was interesting.  The scientist was saying, ""We don't want to discourage people from putting in garden ponds, but just be careful about what you put in them.""  And it's like, is there a problem or not?  Because of this is a problem I don't think we can be telling people they can do it if they want, they just need to be responsible.  That will engender zero change."	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	5	true, can't really expect a normal person to know that a garden pond he made few weeks ago had damaged frog population in his area. definitely need to educate people more on these things	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	6	I'm curious about where the amphibians fit into the food chain and whatever in those areas.  I guess small birds and rodents maybe eat them or something.  And they of course eat bugs and stuff.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	7	I guess, their diet is mostly insects so maybe they do control the balance of them in nature and then off course they themselves are diet to others such as snakes	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
226	8	Talking about mosquito populations would certainly get me to take this issue seriously.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	139.0	48.0	225.0
226	9	oh yes. mosquitoes are just so troublesome so anything to control them should get my vote too. That being said, frogs just seem so harmless and to see them getting killed the way described must be so bad	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	139.0	28.0	725.0
227	0	I feel so bad for all those poor frogs, what do you think should be done to stop the spread of the disease.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	1	I think people should just follow some of the guildelines they were giving in the article.  Maybe they should make more of an effort to spread that information.  I felt sad for the frogs but honestly I didn't feel an overwhelming heartbreak or anything.  In general, the ponds seem to be a positive thing for wildlife.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	10	Yeah maybe, building a pond is a pretty big undertaking so at some point during the process somebody should be informing them or giving them the info they need into what they are doing and the harm they could be causing right.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	11	Yeah I totally agree.  Whose responsibility do you think it should be to inform people, or do you think the people themselves should be responsible for looking up the information?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	12	I think they should definitely get some of the info themselves but i think the shops are also a big part of where they should get the info from.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	13	Yes I agree the shops should be a main source.  They're the ones profiting from this whole thing too	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	14	Exactly, it feels like at some point anyone who wants to build a pond they should come into contact with someone who should be knowledgeable about the current issues and inform them. Maybe require some form of education before you can own something like this?	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	15	Yeah like a contiuing ed class, it could be offered online	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	16	Yeah that would be for the best. That way people know the current issues and can help protect the environment. Sadly it doesn't completely solve the issue but it is a step in the right direction	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	17	Yes I'd like to think it would at least help a little and make a difference	0.0	2.0	2.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	18	For sure it would, i just hope that the UK amphibian population is able to build itself back up once more immune frogs start reproducing.	0.0	2.0	3.0	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	19	You make a good point about how dire these things can wind up being.  It has been good talking to you.  goodbye	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	2	Yeah definitely, and it is a good thing that people are more interesting in helping to preserve wildlife with these man made ponds but the side effects of it are upsetting. The scientific community definitely needs to let people know before more of the population gets infected though.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	20	Likewise, goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	3	Yes I totally agree with you.  LIke they need to put this info out there at shops that carry the items to stock these ponds and in other sources where people can easily find them.  To protect the frogs and the spread of these diseases	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	4	That would be the best way for sure, wouldn't want it to get to the point where so many of the home ponds would have to be filled.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	5	yeah no doubt, that would not be good.  I guess it's just an example of people being careless about things and wildlife suffering as a consequence.  Happens so frequently it's ridiculous	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	6	Yeah it happens way too often, The problem is is that people can't really see outside of their bubble in a way. All these people think is it would be cool to have a pond and buy some frogs to bring in. We need to be better educated on the side effects.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	7	yeah exactly!  and I think they mentioned the ornamental fish too.  Did it say it was spreading to them?  Either way, people obviously aren't thinking this stuff through as well as they should.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
227	8	I know it mentioned that the disease did not start organically or it did not start in the UK. And for sure but can like the average person really think about something like that happening, i feel like the issue is more so about people not being informed enough when they want to do something like this.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	139.0	23.0	226.0
227	9	yeah, so the key would be more education?  getting people, consumers especially, the information they need to make appropriate choices and protect the species	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	139.0	24.0	726.0
228	0	Who knew backyard ponds could cause so much harm.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	1	Certainly not me.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	10	I agree, but for me it was more about human involvement animals	1.0	1.3333	3.0	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	11	I felt the human involvement part was minimized by the fact that they mentioned people definitely shouldn't stop building garden ponds. I mean, it's hard to believe people are consciously moving amphibians from garden ponds to natural ones, but what do I know.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	12	I'm never surprised by what people do anymore. I bet people would read this still move the frogs to a urban pond.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	13	You have a point. I wonder if the problem is isolated in the UK or if it is a problem elsewhere too.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	14	That is a good question. Hopefully it is isolated to the UK.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	15	Do you think there are any practical solutions that weren't mentioned in the article?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	16	I can not think of any, what about you?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	17	Hm, perhaps if they manufactured a cure for the virus that could be spread in the same way as the virus itself, but that would probably take more time and resources than people were willing to commit.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	18	Yeah, most people do not care that much about frogs.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	19	Well, thanks for chatting! have a good one! goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	2	I knew the pet trade caused bad things for environment and animals	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	20	nice chatting with you too! bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	3	Pet trade? I thought the article was more about the transfer of material from human constructs to natural ones?	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	4	and moving frogs from different ponds to ponds.	1.0	1.0	2.3333	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	5	I guess the pet trade could potentially be involved. Do you know anyone with pet frogs?	1.3333	1.0	2.3333	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	6	yeah frog are not good pets	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	7	I've always been a bit persnickety about the caging of animals.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
228	8	I agree animals shouldn't be caged	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	139.0	30.0	227.0
228	9	Honestly, this article lacked some of the emotional appeal that others I have read have had. I mean, I feel for the frogs, but it didn't really offer any solutions to the problem.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	139.0	25.0	727.0
229	0	Sad story for these frogs :(	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	1	I agree! i don't like to hear about animals suffering or dying	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	10	Maybe some type of antivirus to add to their ponds?	1.0	1.0	2.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	11	I was thinking they could spread the cure the same way the disease was spread	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	12	Yeah, like some type of bait	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	13	i think that would be a great start	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	14	Even if there was something for homeowners to do to stop it at their own ponds, then it would be harder for the virus to spread	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	15	yeah i agree, it would be a community effort	0.0	2.0	2.3333	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	16	I agree, the community would all have to work together!	0.0	3.0	2.0	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	17	I think it would be well worth it	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	18	Yes, if it's going to protect the frogs and fish and whatever other wildlife will eventually be affected.	0.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	19	which will have a chain reaction	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	2	I wonder if the general public has been told anything about what they can do to stop the spread of the disease.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	20	Yeah, it's crazy how the loss of one species in an environment can totally throw off the whole ecosystem.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	21	I agree! a small problem can turn into a big one quickly	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	22	It's been nice talking to you!	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	23	you too! goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	24	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	25	7	1.0	0.6667	0.0	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	26	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	3	I'm not sure but i hope so	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	4	I would think most people with garden ponds wouldn't want to endanger the frogs if they knew about it	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	5	I agree. fish too!	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	6	Yeah, and if it's being spread by whatever they are getting from aquatic stores, the stores should have to test before they sell anything	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	7	i agree it is not safe for the local community	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
229	8	They said that the garden ponds could act like stepping stones, but they aren't discouraging people from having them so I wonder if they think there is a way to stop it.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	139.0	57.0	228.0
229	9	True, I	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	139.0	7.0	728.0
232	0	Well I probably have an unpopular opinion about this but it's how I feel.  I think the #metoo movement has gone too far honestly.  I find a lot of these allegations highly questionable and I'm skeptical.  In this case, her roommates from the time period do recall her mentioning it supposedly so there seems to be some validity there.  But you just never really k now with these things, especially when it's brought up twenty years later.  Seems like a lot of women just do this for attention or whatever weird reasons they might have.	1.6667	3.0	1.0	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	1	In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	10	No, you can't punish them, but honestly in my opinion you can't treat a man as though he's guilty unless there is proof.  But unfortunately, once these people make their allegations the public basically treats the person as though they are guilty and their life is destroyed, and often their career and the lives of their family members.  So to me it is just very sad.  And it scares me for my sons.  My husband doesn't even want to be around women at work bc he is scared someone might make up some allegation.  THAT is a hostile environment and unfair to men.	1.3333	4.0	1.6667	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	11	That's true, there needs to be proof before punishment. Anyone who is fired for something like that without proof should be able to sue for wrongful termination.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	12	Yes they should.  But I do understand what you're saying about the true victims and the predicament they are in.  I Just think it's a very sad situation for everyone and it's distressing that this is an issue in our society now.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	13	It is definitely a difficult situation.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	14	Yes really without any good solution.  People would have to constantly be wearing body cameras to have definitive proof one way or the other, which is absurd.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	15	Yep. Or companies would have to start putting cameras up everywhere which is also ridiculous. We just need to teach our children how to handle these situations and hope for the best.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	16	Yeah, no doubt.  Maybe the next generation can see some improvement if parents work to teach them better when they are young.  I don't know.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	17	I hope so.	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	18	You and me both.  Well thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you have a good day.  goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	19	You too. bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	2	"Yeah totally.  It comes down to a ""he says, she says"" in so many cases.  I agree that the fact that she mentioned it at the time lends some credibility to the story.  I just feel like so many men have been unfairly crucified by this whole movement."	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	3	In some cases maybe. Or maybe more women are just speaking up when they were afraid to before, since it's so hard to prove one way or the other.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	4	I would guess a little bit of both, but it could also be that more women are wanting to fabricate things and get int he spotlight bc they see it happening with other women	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	5	I guess it's hard to imagine anyone would want to be recognized for something like that. I mean you never know, I guess. What do you think a woman should do if she's been a victim but has no proof? It's pretty easy to just grab or touch someone without anyone else seeing	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	6	I find it very easy to believe someone would want to be recognized for that.  People will do anything for attention.  Look at reality TV and social media.  I think people should report things when they happen, not 20 years later.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	7	Sure, that would be helpful but even then if you have no proof it doesn't really matter if it just happened does it? It could still be seen as a ploy for attention or an attempt to bring someone down. Or there could be shame involved too. Not everyone is just out to get attention. Some victims are too ashamed to say anything.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
232	8	Yep I agree, but the ones who are fabricating it and doing it for attention are ruining it for the genuine victims	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	128.0	24.0	231.0
232	9	I suppose so. But we can't really punish women for coming forward just because they don't have proof.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	128.0	47.0	731.0
233	0	Hello! How do you feel about this story?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	1	Honestly, I'm sure it sounds insensitive, but I'm tired of these.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	10	If women and men are completely equal. I think men wouldn't really think twice about a women touching their butt. And I don't think 20 that they would be going public about it 20 years later.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	11	Lol.  Every man's wildest fantasy includes a woman touching his butt unanounced.  But no, I don't think men and women are necessariliy equal in abilities and talents, I'm not one of those people.	1.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	12	Too funny! If he did intentionally cup his hand over her butt 20 years ago, would there be anything legally to do about it anyway?	1.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	13	I would assume only in the court of public opinion.  There would be a push to take away his seat.  Which is just another reason to think this was politially motivated.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	14	The world is a scary place. I feel for my kids having to grow up in this environment.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	15	Yeah I think the same thing sometime.  However, when you really think about it, the world could go completely south in the next few years, and still be leaps and bounds better than it was 200/500/1000 years ago.	0.6667	3.0	1.3333	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	16	That's a good way to look at it!	0.0	3.3333	1.0	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	17	Lol, I do however doubt humanity is going to be around for another thousand years.  I'm sure that we're going to find some way to eff things up in the next century or two.	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	18	I think about that all of the time. When you do look at how much it's changed from even just 200 years ago. I wonder how long it can keep going.	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	19	yeah, I remember hearing couple years ago about how we've basically reached the limit that we can on processor speed or storage or something like that.  I wonder when that kind of thing will start to hit our other technologies.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	2	I agree, who knows if it really happened or if this is just political.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	20	Yeah, who knows. I can't imagine the future progressing as quickly as it has over the past 100 years.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	21	Yeah it's like we had the industrial revolution, and maybe now we're nearing the end of the technological revolution.  But who knows...	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	22	Great conversation! Went from butt touching to the end of technological revolution! Nice talking to you!	0.0	3.0	1.3333	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	23	lol yeah good talk. bye	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	24	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	3	Yeah and at this point, particularly after the Smollet, and Kavanaugh case, I just tend to doubt the accuser more.  Especially when the accusations are dated by decades.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	4	Exactly, the timing is always very suspicious.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	5	I understand it form the other perspective too, maybe the name, such as Kavanaugh, becomes so huge in the news, that it infuriates you and you feel like you have to say something. I still just don't buy it though.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	6	Yeah, I can see that too. But it's not like Clarence Thomas just became a big thing recently.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	7	Yeah.  A lot of this supreme court stuff, I think the democrats saw the opportunity for the gop to take a massive majority in the court, and decided they had to take drastic efforts to curb that.  They were too eager to push this narrative, even though the evidence wasn't there.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
233	8	I think these things must really bother people who have been actually attacked / raped... She says he cupped his hand over her butt. If that happened to me, I would probably forget about it by the next day.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	128.0	57.0	232.0
233	9	Seriously.  Ok, this might be a little off the wall, but I think this is the human evolution catching up to society.  It used to be that man protected and hunted, women took care of kids, and were prized for their looks and maternal instincts.  Nowadays, woman have caught up to men in their working ability.  Men have to learn that women aren't their property anymore, and this is a dynamic that might take time to set in with the elitely wealthy.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	128.0	49.0	732.0
235	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	1	I feel so bad for women going through this	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	10	yeah i wonder why they feel that way	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	11	more needs to be done	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	12	what do you think can be done	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	13	more education in school i think on harrasment	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	14	yeah and at home from the parents	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	15	true more values and morals especially for young men	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	16	yeah that would help a lot	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	17	Also, more ways for women to feel safe coming forward against them	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	18	do you know anyone that has gone through what that woman went through	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	19	A couple girls from college it happens there alot and swept under the rug	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	2	do you think it really happened or do you think she might be lying	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	20	yeah i hear that stuff happens a ton in college	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	21	it was great talking to you today!	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	22	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	23	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	3	I think we should never question assault it sets a bad thing moving forward	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	4	thats true i sort of believe her because she was young when it happened	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	5	True and another woman came forward as well	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	6	yeah it makes sense that its true and not a lie given that fact	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	7	men in power doing this are more and more its crazy	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
235	8	yeah they feel like since they have some power they can get women to do whatever they want	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	128.0	19.0	234.0
235	9	it is so gross how do they think its okay	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	128.0	53.0	734.0
236	0	I'm glad the lady was found otherwise she might have been in serious trouble out in the cold.	0.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	1	that's right. Also they did the right thing to send her for medical checkup	0.0	2.0	3.3333	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	10	Yeah, it's definitely hard to relate.  I imagine they experience a lot of confusion and fear associated with not knowing what's going on.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	11	True, Just couple of days ago I learned that Alzheimer patients may die due to suffocation as their brain my forget how to breathe. Don't know how true that is but that is one scary state	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	12	Wow, that's a wild thought.  I can't even imagine what that would be like.  I also don't envy all the people who work in facilities to take care of dementia patients.  Those people are saints.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	13	Exactly, I was thinking about that some time ago, it's like children but when we deal with children we do so with hope that they will learn and growup but there is no hope for those old patients	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	14	I think there's probably already a shortage of these types of workers, and it will only get worse going forward.  Old folks homes and that type of thing are a massive industry now.  We used to just put our elderly in the attic.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	15	It's definitely going to be a bigger problem as people live longer and longer.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	16	"Back to this story, it's still nice to see that there's help out there in various forms.  Police get a bad rap these days but they still do plenty to help people.  And we focus on negative events and people, but there's still no shortage of people willing to help others.  We still have ""communities"" whether we recognize it often or not."	0.0	2.6667	2.0	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	17	Police really have a difficult job, you can do 1000's of such acts in your career but what will be remembered is one less than perfect act. I just hope that the lady in this story gets the help she obviously needs after her rescue	0.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	18	Yes, for sure.  And I'm sure in the short term she's well taken care of.  But the family (assuming she lives with her family) will likely struggle with her for many more years, unfortunately.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	19	Right, I wonder if the govt should get involved in these scenarios somehow. But then what really can they do to provide ease such families	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	2	Yes.  I assume she is mentally ill or has dementia, or was maybe just under the influence of something.  Her family must have been very worried.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	20	Yes, I think it's complicated, and not least of all costly.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	21	Hopefully you will have a nice one too. goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	3	Can't imagine what would they be going through if she was indeed sick with dementia or something	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	4	I wonder if this kind of thing is happening more often now.  People are living longer and maybe more people are forced to take care of elderly or sick relatives at home.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	5	People are definitely living longer and though we are getting better physical treatments but brain seems to age at its separate pace	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	6	"Yes, it's definitely a problem.  I see on TV some ad saying that ""the first survivor of Alzheimer's is alive today,"" or something like that.  So maybe cures for some of these brain diseases are around the corner."	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	7	I hope so, when I think about the old age this is the thing I most fear about. Losing memories of all your life slowly but progressively would really be terrorizing	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
236	8	Yeah, I think so too.  I'd rather meet a swift end than have my brain deteriorate.  My grandfather had Alzheimer's.  It's hard on everyone.	1.6667	4.0	2.3333	1	245.0	48.0	235.0
236	9	It must really be a tough time, my grandmother too had dementia but this is something that is really hard to live through I guess. Hard for someone to imagine the pain as it is not a physical one	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	28.0	735.0
237	0	Have you had any first hand experience with alzheimers or dementia?	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	1	Yes, , my grandmother and you?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	10	Yeah, as difficult as it sounds, the thought of her sitting alone and confused in some nursing home would be even more psychologically damaging.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	11	I understand that some people because of work or other reasons can not do it.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	12	Well, and so people don't get along so swimmingly with their familial relations.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	13	That is true, but the ones that you do get along with, hold them close because we all are on a limited timer.	0.6667	3.6667	2.3333	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	14	Indeed, my uncle died unexpectedly a few years ago and now my grandparents insist that the family gets together at least once a week.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	15	sorry to hear about your uncle. getting together,that would depend on how close with live:)	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	16	One of my brothers and I live in different parts of the country, but the rest of the family participates. My grandmother sends me text messages every day. It's nice.	0.0	2.6667	2.0	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	17	Yeah, I try to stay in touch with my mother, both set of grandparents have passed, my father passed, and My oldest brother died last year at age of 41.	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	18	My condolences for your losses. I hope you treasured your time with all of them. I'm sure they treasured their time with you. Thanks for chatting with me today. goodbye	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	19	nice chatting with you too. bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	2	My great grandfather. It's really sad to think that the police had to reach out to the community to find out where this person belonged. She must have lived alone.. or in a poorly tended elderly community.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	3	Yeah. It is scary thinking that can happen to any of us when with get older.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	4	We all eventually become children a second time, it's true.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	5	It hurt me to see my grandmother lose her Independence	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	6	That's the most unnerving part about it, how much it hurts your family to see you in such a place.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	7	I kept my grandmother at home until she died, most people wanted me to put her in a nursing home but I could not do it.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
237	8	That's what my grandfather did with his parents. I honestly don't think I could handle having to carry my mother to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Good on you.	1.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	245.0	25.0	236.0
237	9	I think you could do it. It is not easy, but it was a honor for me to be able to take care of my grandmother since she did so much for me in my life.	0.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	245.0	30.0	736.0
238	0	Well I thought this was a little sad.  Like, weren't the family even looking for this person?	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	1	I was thinking about that, but if she still lives by herself, they might not have realized that she was gone yet.	1.3333	1.3333	3.0	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	10	Oh yeah, that would be amazing.  It would really impact a lot of families for sure	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	11	I just remembered the story said she was wearing scrub pants. That sounds like she was in a facility. If so, that is horrible if they haven't realized that she is missing.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	12	Oh true, I did not notice that.  That is horrible.  I'm always reading stories of abuse and negligence in these facilities.  That's unforgivable.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	13	I wonder if they noticed she was missing but didn't want to tell the police.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	14	I would say that's definitely possible.  how sad	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	15	That would be sad. I've seen too many stories of facilities covering things up to save their reputation. Maybe they thought she would wander and then eventually return.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	16	YEah I have seen those stories too!  Preying on a highly vulnerable population	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	17	It is so sad, I'm sure it would be hard enough just to make the decision to put someone in a facility, and then to have to deal with this kind of thing.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	18	Yes, for sure.  It would just add to the feelings of guilt.  Well thank you for sharing your feelings with me, have a great day!  goodbye	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	2	yeah I considered that, too.  Did the article mention how long it's been	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	3	I don't recall an exact time but it seemed that it was recent that she had been found.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	4	yeah so maybe the family will realize soon and come locate her.  I hope.	0.0	2.3333	3.0	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	5	Yeah, Alzheimer's runs badly in my dad's family and he is starting to show signs of it. I worry about something like this happening all of the time.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	6	I am sorry to hear that, I know it can be very difficult for family members.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	7	"Yeah, it's almost more the family than the person with the disease. I read a story once similar to this and when the family picked up the lady, she was like, ""Hey, where are we going now."" She didn't even realize what had just happened."	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
238	8	That is what I have heard about the family.  That's so sad.  My husband's grandmother had alzheimers and passed away last year.  It was very hard on their family too.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	245.0	24.0	237.0
238	9	So sorry. I keep hearing that they are so close to a cure. I hope so!	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	245.0	57.0	737.0
239	0	i wonder what was wrong with that woman	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	1	yeah sounds like she had some serious medical problems.  wouldn't be this much hubbub if it was just a drunk person.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	10	theres people you can pay to look after them while working. caring for someone does not mean you are with them 24/7 lol	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	11	Lol do you have any experience with this? Do you have any idea how expensive home health care nurses are?  Most people cannot afford those services, and even if you can, most home health care only show up for an hour a day.  To pay for help to watch your parent full time, while you work full time, would be pointless.	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	12	well I guess thats a price I'm willing to pay for my parents who took care of my annoying self as a child even though I was not always nice to them. There is more than just health care nurses out there lol.	0.6667	3.0	2.0	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	13	Look, this isn't even about caring for a parent, this is about caring for a parent, who also wants to wake up at 2 am, and head to the grocery store that doens't exist.  I'm aware that you think you've got it all figured out, but I can assure you, life with a spouse who has dementia is tougher than you think.	1.6667	4.0	3.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	14	trust me I'm currently caring for kids that were taken from my sister because of her mental problems. I am now taking care of them as seen by the state. I am not with them 24/7 and I find ways to look after them and make sure their homework is done on time. Even the bad child who was out until 4 am when he was under my sisters care doesn't sneak out now. I am not new to caring for people. Someone with dementia is a whole other ballgame. No one has it all figured out, its just that caring for loved ones is not that difficult. Maybe we were raised differently.	1.0	4.3333	2.3333	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	15	I'm not saying that you can't care for people, I just think blaming the caretakers for a sick old person getting out is kind of jumping the gun.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	16	if you know someone you are looking after has dementia you raise you level of care. You install alarm systems, phone apps etc. The technology is there. Ofc it wont work all the time and I am not trying to discredit your points because they are valid. But you just have to step your game up according to the circumstances	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	17	Well I agree with that.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	18	I agree with many of your points as well its just if there is a will theres a way	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	19	True, just remember it isn't the will of a thirty year old we're talking about here a lot, it's a seventy something year old spouse who doesn't want to stop caring for their loved one.  But I hear ya.	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	2	yeah its obvious she has mental problems	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	20	yeah most definitely my parents are up there in age thank god they are still with me mentally.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	21	That's definitely got to be one of those diseases that really affects the kids and spouses more than the patient themselves.  I couldn't imagine my wife or parents forgetting who I was, or the memories we shared.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	22	Thats a scary thought bro. We have to be thankful everyday no one close to us has that disease and hope it stays that way.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	23	I always love reading the news that they're close to finding a cure for alzheimers.  Hope that that'll never be something I deal with.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	24	yeah we always read about these cures but to be honest they still seem far away	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	25	True. I'm sure a lot of them are just clickbait.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	26	Yeah these sites that clickbait these cures need to be removed. I can't imagine getting my hopes up if my wife had dementia only to click on it and see it was nothing. Thats playing with peoples emotions a little too much. Anyway, this has been the best talk I've had on one of these hits brother. I respect you very much for that. Hope the rest of your day goes well. bye	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	27	Yeah pretty good discussion! bye.	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	3	I saw that she was almost seventy.  In my line of work, you see a lot dementia or alzheimers patients tht get out of their house and wander.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	4	yeah it happens to some people at that age which begs the question who was taking care of her	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	5	Yeah, it's hard to blame the caretaker though.  There's a lot of people out there who are afraid of homes, and think they can take care of their spouse in their later years.  Gets difficult, and next thing you know George snuck his way out of the house while you were taking a shower.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	6	Surely someone will step up	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	7	There's a lot of people without family out there, and even then, caring for a mentally ill older patient can be incredibly difficult and time consuming.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
239	8	if that was my parent none of that would matter tbh. id care for them.	0.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	245.0	19.0	238.0
239	9	If you have a job, that becomes impossible.  If you don't have a job, how do you make money?	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	245.0	49.0	738.0
240	0	What did you think of it?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	1	You just feel for older people so sad	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	10	yeah it is pretty sad, his wife died two years ago, they had been married since they were 18 and sweethearts since age 14 or so.  really sad.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	11	oh i could not imagine how heartbreaking that is seems like theyve been able to live a very long life good for them	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	12	yeah I guess so.  I think it gets rough at a certian point, like are people even meant to live that long?	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	13	I agree I dont think I would want to	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	14	yeah same here	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	15	someday maybe there will be a pill to slow down aging then maybe i would	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	16	yeah I agree, it seems people get so miserable	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	17	miserable and then just lose there minds not a great quality of life	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	18	No, it is not at all.  well I must go, nice talking to you.  bye!	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	19	you two thank you bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	2	yeah exactly how it made me feel!  it is sad to see such decline	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	3	I think this type of thing is happening more and more these days	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	4	yeah I have noticed that to, why do you think that is?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	5	I am not sure maybe something about how that generation lived	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	6	maybe so, or maybe just a breakdown of family, I really don't know.   probably a combination of many factors.  people are too busy to deal with it.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	7	I agree Dr oz his mother just got althiemers he said many families just dont want to face reality	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
240	8	yeah that's a good point, too.  It's a lot to swallow.  my grandfather is 98 and needs constant care, it's really hard on my mom	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	245.0	24.0	239.0
240	9	aw i am so sorry i could not imagine mentally and emotionally so sad	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	245.0	53.0	739.0
241	0	Hi did you read about the artical on smugglers?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	1	Smugglers and refugees, yes. You?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	10	Yes and they mention that goverments are just turning a blind eye -- does that mean all countries? they're just not really clear.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	11	Now am wondering which journalist, and more importantly, which journal of opinion, would run such a slap dash article.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	12	I'm not sure, but I remember that this was an article from CNN, or so it stated as a resource at the very beginning -- CNN is ver impartial though, and a lot of what was in it seemed a bit emotional, and not detached factual, I hope that sounded right! :)	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	13	Wow, you really paid your dues in attention. I don't watch/read much CNN. You have any ideas on how to deal with integration of all these refugees into western society?	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	14	Thank you! CNN was in parenthesizes before the first sentence. I wish I had a solution, but I think that if more goverments got involved in the countries it was effecting, perhaps it would help. Maybe pursuing the matter more through the UN.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	15	I wonder about the UN's effectiveness sometimes. I'd like to see some numbers on how these people are being settled.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	16	That is a very interesting point. I know that the UN typicly will get involved, but it is a process...and the effectiveness it has usually relies on the international help of other countries involvements.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	17	Not just international help, but international agreement on the correct course of action, the place has to be a hornets nest.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	18	I wish there was a good way to solve these issues. I'm not the best when it comes to issues, I try to keep up with news, but these poor people that are just trying to get away from war in their county, and theirs little to no help.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	19	Right, it's not like anyone wants to leave their home. They are forced from the houses of their father's and then drown in the ocean alone and afraid. Jeez.. thanks for chatting, bye	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	2	Yes indeed, It was aufull to read to know so many are affected. what did you think of it?	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	20	bye!	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	3	I think that even though the article was from 2016 it is still very relevant. I also thought it quite morbid that no accounts of rescue were mentioned. These people are drowning along well trafficked routes through the Mediterranean and no one can be bothered to help? At all?	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	4	I agree, what I found was really terrible was that thousands of people drowned in the Medaterain, and goverments arnt doing anything to stop that from happening	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	5	I wonder how many of the one million refugees Merkel promised to harbor actually made it to Germany.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	6	That a good question. This article was a little hard to take it all in, I wish they would of made it a bit more readable because there was so MUCH important information concerning so many countries in the word.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	7	Yeah, it was a little discursive. One minute were talking about smugglers, then were on to drownings and finally some war reporting. It would have scanned better emotionally with better focus.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
241	8	Indeed, Perhaps they can segment it better so they can make three articles out of this focusing on different countries concerning smugglers, that would certainly help... again there was SO much information it was hard to tak in all of it..	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	19.0	3.0	240.0
241	9	Also, smugglers barely got a mention in passing. What kind of smugglers were they? Where are they from? That was a lead to nowhere.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	19.0	25.0	740.0
242	0	That was a sad article	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	1	I agree, what do you think can be done to help?	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	10	also hold those accountable that are doing harm to those countries	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	11	I hate to say it but we are part of the problem.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	12	yes true but what i mean by that is the dictators	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	13	We took out Liyba's dictator and leave them without a government.	1.6667	1.3333	3.0	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	14	that was a mess that guy was doing good things for that country	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	15	now they say it is a waste land. I know these problems do not have simple answers, but they do have answers.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	16	its a slippery slope	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	17	I would hate to be on a nice modern ship in the ocean. It would be hard for me to get on a cheap boat with 300 people hanging on, but I guess I would not have a choice.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	18	yeah when your kids are at risk you do anything to save them	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	19	sadly a lot kids die on those boats too.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	2	We can probably help better those countries	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	20	its either die on a boat or die in your homeland. its a pick your poison type of situation	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	21	Do you have any other thoughts about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	22	just hope for the best for them. it was a good talk. bye	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	23	you too bye	1.0	1.0	0.3333	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	3	I agree. It makes me think how good we have it.	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	4	Yeah what do you think should be done	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	5	Allow more people in and help the countries better themselves for people do not have to leave.	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	6	i think thats a good idea	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	7	I think people in this world need my empathy for others. Nobody risks their life on a cheap boat because they want to steal from your country or take what you have. They just want a better life.	1.3333	2.3333	3.6667	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
242	8	I think we need to just let some in not all because most countries cant handle all of that to be honest	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	19.0	19.0	241.0
242	9	I agree, the main focus should be country improvements.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	30.0	741.0
243	0	That's a heckuva lot of refugees heading towards Europe!	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	1	Yeah I found the numbers staggering too.  Plus the death toll were shockingly high.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	10	Yes, I can't imagine growing up in environments like Syria.  I wonder what the long-term repercussions are for the health and well being of children raised there, whether or not they're forced to flee.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	11	Yeah and if it has an impact on relationships, like are people scared to get close to each other bc you can lose people so easily	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	12	Yeah, that's an interesting point.  I'd never thought of that.  I'd certainly be devastated losing someone close, so i could definitely see myself being hesitant to get close to people.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	13	Yeah, how very tragic.  I guess it makes me grateful to live in this beautiful country	1.0	3.0	2.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	14	Indeed.  I wonder what birth rates are like in these countries while these things are going on.  And what the birth rates are like for refugees once they get to a new country where they feel safe.  Not sure it's important, just curious, I suppose.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	15	Yeah that would be interesting to see!  Like does it affect their willingness to have more children	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	16	I'd certainly hope that living in a warzone would give people pause, but who knows.  I never put it past people to have children they probably would be better off not having.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	17	Well there are so many horrendous parents out there, it is sometimes astonishing so yeah, I agree	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	18	I'm amazed that Germany agreed to take 1 million refugees.  I wonder what the reaction in Germany was like.	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	19	I was also shocked by that!  Like, what the heck!?!?  That will surely have an impact on their economy.  Well I gotta run, it's been great chatting with you.  Have a great weekend.  bye!	0.6667	3.0	1.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	2	I was curious how the deal with Turkey has decreased numbers in that path to Europe.  I wonder how Turkey is slowing/stopping the migration.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	20	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good weekend.  bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	3	I don't know anything about the deal with Turkey, fill me in?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	4	The article described the three paths the migrants are using to get to Europe.  Basically Western Africa, which isn't a lot, Libya/Central Africa, and then through Turkey.  But it said that a deal had been made between Greece and Turkey (I think), to limit that number, suggesting Turkey was keeping migrants from moving through their country and into Greece/Europe.  Sort of like the US is asking Mexico to prevent migrants from C. America to move through their country and into ours.  I was just curious how Turkey was accomplishing this.	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	5	ahhh gotcha.  Maybe some form of heightened border patrol?  Good question.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	6	Yeah.  I'd think that once the migrants got into Turkey it would be harder to do anything about them.  Either way this is a big challenge for Europe.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	7	Yeah definitely!  And it doesn't seem like it will be getting better anytime soon.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
243	8	Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or if there is one.  Certainly it has to do with reforming these peoples' home countries.  That's where the problem starts, of course.  But how to do that.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	19.0	48.0	242.0
243	9	Yeah no doubt,  That's the million dollar question.  I guess it's just really sad for all the innocent victims like the kids	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	19.0	24.0	742.0
244	0	This story is so sad. I can't imagine trying to live like that.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	1	neither can i, it sounds awful	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	10	Yeah, and to be a parent of a small child, to see their innocence and want to protect that for them.	1.6667	4.0	1.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	11	TRUE	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	12	If I was in that situation I would try to leave too.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	13	me too. i just wish the country was more stable so that noone of them had to leave their homes	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	14	That would be best. I can't imagine having to leave whatever you have and go to a new country and start from nothing.	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	15	that would be horrible!	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	16	Actually thinking about it that way, I don't know if I would have the courage to leave.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	17	you probably would if you were in those conditions	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	18	Maybe, but it would be really scary. I can't imagine having to start a completely new life in a new country. The people that do leave must be very strong people!	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	19	definitely. desperation plays a role too	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	2	I guess risking your life to leave would be worth it when you are already living in such a dangerous area.	1.3333	3.0	3.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	20	True, I guess it's choosing the best between two not great things.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	21	yep its a sacrifice for sure	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	22	TRUE	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	23	i wish them all the best	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	24	Me too. It's been good talking to you!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	25	you too! goodbye	0.0	1.6667	1.0	2	19.0	7.0	743.0

244	27	7	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	28	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	3	yeah im sure thats what motivates them	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	4	I wonder how this situation is now. The article said Obama was president at the time. It said 1 out of every 50 people in the country had been killed at that time.	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	5	i dont know. i know isis has been basically completely taken out of the area since then	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	6	Hopefully it's better!	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	7	i think it is , at least slghtly	0.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
244	8	It really makes me thankful that I can live somewhere that I am not constantly in fear of my life. I just feel so horribly for anyone that has to live in that type of situation.	1.0	4.0	2.3333	1	19.0	57.0	243.0
244	9	me too, especially children	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	19.0	7.0	743.0
245	0	Hello what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	1	i think i feel so sad for these citizens	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	10	I feel bad for the families that are still alive but lost a member	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	11	i know that must be so heartbreaking i couldnt deal	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	12	Yeah i would just cry all day and go into depression. It's good these people are trying to have a better life though	1.6667	3.6667	3.3333	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	13	very true atleast there trying to do something about there circumstances	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	14	Let's hope their famlies are able to live better lives.	0.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	15	as the future progresses hopefully they get aid and better living situations	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	16	Yeah and the children get education	0.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	17	true then they could do even more for the country	0.3333	2.0	3.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	18	That's a good way to think about it! Well it was nice talking to you, bye	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	19	you two ! bye	0.3333	1.0	1.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	2	Yeah it's so bad because they just wanted a better life	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	3	everyone deserves to live a safe life	1.0	2.3333	3.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	4	I agree. They were all so excited to go somewhere new but ended up dying	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	5	they need to help that country out so people dont want to flee	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	6	I agree, maybe give them more food and water	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	7	build up there police and governemnt	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
245	8	That's a good idea. I wonder if USA will help	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	19.0	17.0	244.0
245	9	they should since they are the most powerful	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	19.0	53.0	744.0
246	0	Did you enjoy the article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	1	No, not really.  I didn't care for her or the Clintons so there is that.  I'm sorry for the loss of a life and the loss for the loved ones left behind I suppose.  How about you?	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	10	yeah tahts true i agree	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	11	I was young during the whole Janet Reno era too, I just remember her name being mentioned at the time.  Some of the things the article mentioned were disturbing.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	12	i agree with that. like i said most of my memories of her were from SNL haha	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	13	haha I Never saw that show before, but I know what it is.  I'm sure Parkinson's is probably an unpleasant way to go.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	14	yeah i definitely agree there	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	15	and I'm always sad for the family when things like that happen	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	16	me too i know how it is	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	17	I'm very sorry to hear that	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	18	its okay, nice chatting with you, have a good day! goodbye	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	19	and you as well, bye!	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	2	It was interesting to learn about her. Famous politicians always fascinate me whether i agree with their views or not	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	3	Yeah it is always interesting to read.  I agree with that for sure.	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	4	i am too young to remember a lot of her, i almost remember the saturday night live sketches of her more than her actual deeds	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	5	hahaha.  I find anyone associated with the Clintons to be distasteful but whatever, at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal to me.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	6	yeah i agree with that. dont have much of a soft spot for many politicians these days	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	7	yeah it is really hard to like any of them!  hard to conjure up sympathy for sure	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
246	8	they probably wouldnt spare any tears for any of us lol	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	177.0	7.0	245.0
246	9	lol no I seriously doubt they would.  I think most of what they do is just an act put on for the public.  It is definitely interesting to read about though.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	177.0	24.0	745.0
247	0	What do you think about her death	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	1	I think she lived a full life.	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	10	I just know you lose your memory	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	11	Is that part of it? Doesn't it make your hands shake also?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	12	yeah I believe that happens too	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	13	Do you think there will be another female attorney general in the near future?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	14	most likely. once the first one comes through it opens the door one would think for the next generation of females. whats your opinion?	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	15	I think its likely. I don't know who it might be though.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	16	yeah i have no idea about politics to be honest	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	17	I follow them with mild interest. It gets to be very depressing after a while though. Do you vote?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	18	yeah I definitely vote. More likely to vote now with all that trouble going on in the white house.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	19	Yeah, next year is going to be a circus. Well, thanks for chatting! bye	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	2	yeah, did you hear about her before this article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	3	I had, but I was a very small child during the Clinton admin, so I didn't really know her function or capacity as a politician.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	4	I remember her from the Elian Gonzales news back in the day	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	5	Oh yeah! I had completely forgotten about that kid. I wonder what he is up to now.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	6	i think he lives in cuba now not sure	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	7	Do you have any experiences with Parkinson's disease?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
247	8	Fortunately no, what about you?	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	246.0
247	9	Nope, not personally. I really don't know that much about it.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	177.0	25.0	746.0
248	0	The thing I remember most about Janet Reno is Will Ferrell playing her on Saturday Night Live.	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	1	I remember that. I'm glad she broke barriers for women	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	10	Okay.  Do you think the crime bill was driven by malice or just ignorance?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	11	Both	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	12	"Hmm.  Back to Reno for a second, I wonder if her ""stiffness"" was related to her eventual Parkinson's.  I assume it was, although I don't know much about Parkinson's, at least in its early form."	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	13	It could have been, my grandmother had Parkinson's and it locked up her arms and hands	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	14	"I thought the quote from Holder was interesting about Reno always asking what the ""right"" thing to do was, since neither of them always did the right thing."	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	15	As I get older I look at all people in high positions as being human and having the same flaws as everybody else.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	16	So do you think that pretty much anyone who got to those positions would corrupt and do sketchy or even illegal things?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	17	Yes, most people look of for their best interest. I think congress both parties have sold out the American people.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	18	Yeah.  I also tend to think that the rare person who WOULD remain truly ethical and pure would never rise to the heights of national office.  I don't think they'd ever get there in the first place.  You have to be more ruthless and self-serving than that.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	19	Agreed. I think the two party system is for us the people to fight while the people at the top keep enjoying the soils	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	2	Actually, I'm just kidding.  I remember her for her actual job.  She was a very high profile Attorney General.  A lot of really big events took place in the 1990s with her involved.	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	20	Yes, it certainly seems like a rich-get-richer type system at this point.  Oh well, at least everyone, including apparently Janet Reno, eventually dies.  That's gotta be some relief.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Have a great day.  bye	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	21	You too. bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	3	Yeah, but looking back at her work with the Clinton makes me wonder.	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	4	She certainly didn't get out of her job with a squeaky clean reputation.	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	5	How do you think that era will be looked at in history?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	6	That's a good question.  I suppose it depends on who you ask.  But it was post-Cold War and Clinton didn't do much overseas, so it was mostly domestic stuff.  Clinton scandals, domestic terrorism, and a good economy.  I guess those are the things I remember.	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	7	Yeah, with all this 92 crime bill talk, makes me look at the whole group differently.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
248	8	What's the 92 crime bill talk?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	48.0	247.0
248	9	Mainly Joe Biden voting for Clinton's 92 crime bill	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	30.0	747.0
249	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	1	She was a remarkable woman.	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	10	Thanks and yeah I hope they find something out or figure out ways to repair the brain	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	11	That would be awesome. I have high hope they will there's so many smart people in this world.	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	12	yeah there are some very smart people especially in the past few years	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	13	It makes me greatful for everyday I have with my family. Sometimes I forget to be thankfull in the small stresses of life	0.3333	4.0	2.0	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	14	I agree we wake up and see our family and think nothing of it like its supposed to be this way at all times. Little do we know we are lucky to be that healthy still.	0.6667	4.0	2.3333	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	15	That;s a great way to look at it. Enjoy the times now and try to be happy so when you need to look back at the memories they bring you joy.	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	16	Yeah most people dont realize that.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	17	It stinks that it takes bad things happening for that wake up call	1.6667	3.3333	1.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	18	Yeah, its just how we are naturally	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	19	Maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	2	i remember hearing about her in the news as a kid	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	20	It's been a great talk! Have a great and blessed day. bye	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	21	bye	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	3	I didn't watch the news much growing up so I had no idea ho she was before reading this. It;s so sad she suffered from parkinsons for 20 years.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	4	that disease is terrible	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	5	i cannot even imagine having it. Constantly moving, but I wonder if any medicine can control it some	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	6	yeah and forgetting things thats scary	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	7	I saw a video online of a lady with dementia and herson took her out to dinner and she didn't recognize him at all. It broke my heart.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
249	8	yeah my father had a stroke a few years back and the only thing I was worried about was if he would recognize us all, thankfully he did others are not so lucky.	1.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	177.0	19.0	248.0
249	9	I'm so sorry! That had to be so scary. I am glad he recognized you. That is a big fear of  mine , forgetting people or having someone you love forget you.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	177.0	16.0	748.0
251	0	I found this to be quite tragic.  Any incident like this is just terrible, especially for the families and people involved.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	1	Yes, I thought the article showed quite a broad range of experiences.  People trying to survive the incident itself.  People finding out and dealing with dead loved ones.  People angry about it.  Officials trying to maintain safety and order going forward.	1.6667	4.0	2.3333	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	10	Oh yeah, no doubt.  It would be traumatizing probably for the rest of their lives.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	11	I sort of felt ambivalent about them saying they repaired the site and removed any traces of the incident.  On one hand I understand that. on the other I guess I felt like, to some extent you don't want to forget.  You want to admit what happened so you can acknowledge you survived it.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	12	Yeah that's a really good point.  Like they should have done something else to signify the fact that a tragedy happened there for the survivors maybe.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	13	I also wondered what the increased governmental powers that were mentioned referred to.  Sort of like the US with the Patriot Act after 9/11.  A lot of how France reacted seemed pretty consistent with how the U.S. responds.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	14	Yeah, did they mention what those powers specifically were?  Perhaps they were following the lead of the U.S.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	15	No, I don't think they mentioned specifics.  I wondered if it was something akin to Marshall Law, like curfews or just the power to search people or something.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	16	Yeah probably so.  Things like that seem to follow mass tragedies like this.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	17	I think we've been pretty good at preventing this type of terrorism (I'm ignoring domestic terrorism/mass shootings) for a while.  Hopefully that's a sign we can police it or that the forces behind it are being defeated or something.	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	18	Hopefully you are right.  I think we must remain vigilant.  Hope you enjoy your day, goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	19	Yes, it was nice talking to you.  I agree, this is something we'll have to be diligent about for a long time.  Have a good day, too. bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	2	Yeah, it just goes to show how many lives are impacted when something like this happens.  It just seems like it happens all too frequent nowadays.  It's terrible.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	3	For sure.  I thought the portrayal of the father was quite poignant.  I found him to be quite reflective and I could really feel his suffering.	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	4	"Yeah totally, me too.  That impacted me the most out of the entire article.  As a mother of four, that's just the ultimate tragedy for a parent.  I""m so sad for him."	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	5	I also wondered about the guilt of the band playing that night.  Angels of Death Metal, I think they were called.  Imagine being the band that night, who advertised for people to come, wanted people to come, and then they were subjected to terror because of it.  They'll have to live with that guilt their whole lives, I'm sure.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	6	Yeah, just like in the situation in Las Vegas in the USA.  That concert where so many people were killed.  I can't imagine the band or artist playing wouldn't feel somehow guilty.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	7	The other thing that stood out was the description of people hiding and listening to gunfire for like 3 hours.  Starting and stopping.  That would be terrifying.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
251	8	Wouldn't it?  Like crouched in some area not knowing if you'll make it out alive or not.  That's so sad too.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	413.0	24.0	250.0
251	9	I'm sure a lot of people have PTSD from that event.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	413.0	48.0	750.0
252	0	It is a bit sad to say but i had forgotten about this terrorist attack because of how often they happen now a days but reading this article is so heartbreaking.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	1	yeah I had totally forgotten about this attack as well	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	10	I always wonder how someone who survives something like that moves on afterwords, i feel like feeling safe after is difficult.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	11	hopefully they receive the correct help from people trained for those types of situations	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	12	Yeah for sure, Reading the article is always harder when they include names and faces. Really reminds you that these are people instead of just the number of them hurt.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	13	Yeah, for example Denys Plaud who survived because when the attackers burst in he was up on the balcony where there was more room.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	14	Yeah he was lucky, it really feels like at it is just about being lucky sometimes to live through these things	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	15	its about being lucky and being at the right place at the right time. too many things tbh i rather just not be in that situation	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	16	Definetely so many of things, just everything completely out of your control. Hopefully something like that does not happen again soon.	1.0	3.0	2.3333	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	17	yeah one can only wish for things to change	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	18	That and making sure that everyday counts, things like that really remind me of that.	0.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	19	life is too short and fragile and these stories reinforce that feeling	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	2	It makes me upset in a way that the fact that we can even forget about something this horrific is possible. It feels like nothing is being done, or at least nothing is being accomplished.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	20	Definetely, even though the story was heartbreaking it was nice talking to you. goodbye	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	21	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	3	what do you think can be done to prevent these things in the future	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	4	I am not sure really. I want to say just stop trying to meddle in other countries business cause that is what creates resentment and these people.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	5	countries shouldnt behave like the world police i agree	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	6	Let the other countries solve their problems on their own and focus on the problems we have at home cause there are many of them. But then the world may look at those countries as selfish no?	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	7	i just say we focus on our own problems and let them deal with their own as well	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
252	8	Yeah i agree. I feel so bad for all of those families effected also. There must have been some who lost more than one person in the attack.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	413.0	23.0	251.0
252	9	I can only imagine the pain they went through...	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	413.0	19.0	751.0
253	0	This story is horrible.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	1	I would tend to agree, its so hard to read that	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	10	Yeah me too, I didn't realize how long it lasted.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	11	they must be affected still, as anticipating death for three hours would take a toll on anyone	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	12	Hopefully the survivors were able to get help.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	13	yeah, that feeling of being trapped for so long is really hard to imagine. I hope they find some solace	1.6667	3.6667	3.0	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	14	It sounded like there were lots of things done in the city to support the victims and survivors, but that probably only helps for a short time.	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	15	Yeah, I don't know how I would feel about it, if I were a relative or a victim to have so much media attention on the anniversary of the day	1.0	3.0	2.6667	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	16	I know, I wonder to. It may help some people, but some people are probably annoyed by it. It's kind of like how my brother died from cancer and I hate all of the cancer t-shirts and ribbons and stuff. I feel like its celebrating cancer.	2.0	4.6667	3.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	17	plus its just a reminder of the awfulness that caused the tragedy, and you may not necessarily want to think about it	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	18	I think that's exactly what it is.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	19	at least, they know there are people there for them, if they need them though	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	2	I know, very hard to read. I can't even imagine having to live through it.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	20	I'm sure seeing the amount of people that come out for a benefit or maybe send a note or whatever, I'm sure it helps the people a lot. But at the end of the day, that is all gone, and that is probably the most hard time.	1.0	3.0	3.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	21	its definitely a sorrowful event. Thanks for the chat, I think we should wrap it up!	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	22	you too, bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	23	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	3	it was so surreal sounding. I can read the words, but its hard to truly imagine it happening	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	4	Exactly, and I read it buy it was like looking at something and trying so hard not to see it.	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	5	how the father learned of his daughters death was harrowing too.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	6	No one should have to find something like that out on social media, but I don't think anyway of finding that out would be horrible.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	7	definitely, there is no easy way to get that news.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
253	8	Also, the people that survived it. I think it said it went on for 3 hours, hearing shooting. I can't imagine life ever being normal again after that.	2.0	4.0	3.0	1	413.0	57.0	252.0
253	9	I was just thinking something along the same lines. I remember hearing about this when it happened, but I don't remember it being over such a long period of time.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	413.0	11.0	752.0
254	0	So, how do you feel about the Paris attacks?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	1	I think that they are senseless acts of violence, but I also do not think it is wise to made fun of people's religion. What do you think?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	10	Right. I'm curious as to what the demographics were of the rest of the crowd.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	11	That is a good question. Do you think these types of terrorist acts of mass shooting are just going to be the norm from here on out?	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	12	Fortunately, attacks of this scale don't happen very often. I think that there will be even more of a threat now with so many people emigrating from the middle east to new homes in Europe.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	13	Do you see the immigrants as the threat or attacks on the immigrants by like in New Zealand	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	14	I see racism and nationalism as the threat. The quickest way for someone to find themselves in this terrorist groups is to be alienated and discriminated against.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	15	Sadly, I agree. I wish people can see that we are more alike than different.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	16	People love to have a simple solution to the complex problems that they have to deal with every day. Blaming immigrants is the easiest way to explain away all of their problems at once all while creating a common enemy.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	17	I agree. I think most of thinking is pushed by the people at the top of the class system for the people at the bottom fight each other and do not look at them.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	18	Yep, the same tactics have been used for millennia and continue to be effective.	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	19	What do you think about the book that the father was making in honor of his daughter?	1.0	1.6667	3.0	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	2	I agree, I can't imagine being roused from bed with news that a family member had been the victim of a terrorist attack. The racist backlash is just the simplest knee jerk reaction to this kind of thing when there is no other revenge to be had.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	20	I think it is a very thoughtful was to memorialize anyone. I hope that he can one day find peace through constructive activities like that. Thanks for chatting today! bye	0.0	2.6667	3.0	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	21	Nice chatting with you too! bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	3	I would hate to find out one of my children were killed on social media.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	4	Yeah, of all the details that was the most barbed.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	5	Do you think the victim's father will find real peace?	1.3333	1.6667	3.3333	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	6	I think it depends on the type of person he is. Something tells me this is the kind of thing that will always haunt you.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	7	Yeah, I would like to think I would not be hateful, but I have never been in his shoes.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
254	8	I was speaking more about the loss of a child than focusing hatred on the shooters, but thankfully I don't have any firsthand experience either.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	413.0	25.0	253.0
254	9	No matter how a child dies, natural causes, accident or murder I do not think a parent ever gets over it.	1.0	3.0	3.3333	2	413.0	30.0	753.0
255	0	Always sadder to experience these events from the perspective of individual people, like the father, I think.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	1	yeah his story was truly heartbreaking.  can you imagine	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	10	And even that was a peculiar thing because I think they'd been here so long.  I get the feeling that it's gotten very hard to get explosives and things necessary for anything more than single people shooting or running over people.  And even then we're not seeing those types of attacks.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	11	San Bernardino I think.  but yeah, hopefully it is dying down.  it is the domestic incidents that are still a major concern here	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	12	"I wonder if the rise of ISIS in the middle east has their focus on that region.  Regardless of what people think about foreign wars, I do think it encourages the ""battle"" to be fought elsewhere, and not on our home soil."	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	13	maybe so, that is an interesting perspective	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	14	But yeah, we've got plenty of domestic incidents to be concerned about regardless.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	15	seriously.  I don't even like going to crowded places anymore.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	16	Yeah, although I'd encourage you to keep it in perspective. You'd be as likely to win Powerball as to be the direct victim of one of these things.  Though both events are technically possible.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	17	I don't know.  I think there are more shooting victims than powerball winners, but either way I don't like crowds to start with so it's not like I'm sacrificing something I love.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	18	Okay, well that's good.  I'm not too big on crowds myself.	0.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	19	Yeah it is just not appealing.  I'd rather be home with my family and close loved ones.  Well it has been good talking to you, have a good day!!  bye	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	2	And also the terror that one guy made me feel as he and others hid in the balcony and listened to the gunfire for three hours.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	20	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	3	yeah those were the two main things that stood out to me too.  The fear, it's just unimaginable.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	4	They didn't talk about it, but I'd feel terrible if I was the band playing that night.  I'd feel like I'd encouraged people to come to this event and then many of them died and all were traumatized.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	5	yeah it would almost feel like it was your fault wouldn't it.  ugh.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	6	We haven't had one of these big terrorist acts (ignoring domestic mass shootings) in a while it seems.  In Europe or here.  Hopefully that means we're getting better at policing them, or the terrorists are dwindling in numbers or resources or sometihng.	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	7	I really hope so.  when was the last one on american soil?	0.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
255	8	Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Maybe that thing in California where that couple used assault rifles and stuff to shoot at their coworkers or whatever it was. But that was a few years ago, I think.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	413.0	48.0	254.0
255	9	yeah that is exactly what i was thinking	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	413.0	24.0	754.0
256	0	Kidnapping children is the most cowardly thing someone can do	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	1	Yes, this is a pretty vile story.  Truly disgusting.	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	10	I feel like its a lost hope in that part of the world. I don't know if its the CIA creating these groups or what, but its been going on for a while now.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	11	Yeah, it's probably pretty futile.  The issues are long-standing and complicated and oftentimes we don't fully understand them.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	12	There's a lot that goes on that we don't know	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	13	It's also sort of interesting how we've been allies and enemies of the same groups at different times.  So in many ways there aren't always good guys and bad guys, clear and simple.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	14	its tought to pull the trigger on the cause of why the groups are created	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	15	I just hoped that trying to establish democracy in the region, like in Iraq, would give the people a greater sense or power and responsibility for their own fates.  But maybe that was too much to hope for.  Look at Russia.  They get out from under the burden of communism and many want to return to it, and they're happy with a de facto dictator like Putin.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	16	remember Libya. They had a pretty good dictator who had the country going well yet somehow they revolted against him and now look at that country.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	17	Yeah, it's a mess.  I guess I'm thankful I live in this part of the world.  We find a lot to complain about, but it could certainly be worse.	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	18	yeah i rather be here than there thats for sure	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	19	My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and is counting down the days until he leaves.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	2	Very disgusting indeed	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	20	i would never want to live there its too backwards. its been a good talk bro. bye	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	21	yeah, see ya.  bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	3	I'm not sure what the solution is but I certainly feel no sympathy for however ISIS is wiped out.	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	4	probably just hurt their finances freeze all accounts instead of the usual drone strikes? But who knows they would still find ways around it	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	5	Yeah, and I'm not actually sure what their strength is at this point.  Their influence outside the region certainly seems limited.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	6	theyre definitely not that influential outside of that region thats for sure	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	7	"I sometimes wonder about the general temperament of some of these populations.  In the US we went to war against our ""oppressors.""  At what point do these middle eastern populations get fed up with dictators and other oppressive groups?  The people have plenty of guns.  They can form militias too.  I'd rather go down fighting than just be executed in the street."	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
256	8	They're programmed to believe these fighers are for their religion. If they go against them they would probably be told they are going against islam and all that talk.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	174.0	19.0	255.0
256	9	Yeah, that could certainly be the case.  Many forces and a lot of history acting on the people in these places, I guess.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	174.0	48.0	755.0
257	0	Well this article just made me really grateful to be an American.  The horrors those people are enduring are truly outlandish.	1.3333	4.3333	3.6667	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	1	And for what? The aggressors must know that this is a fight they can't win.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	10	Is it effective?  How so??	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	11	Fear and intimidation are effective no matter where you are on the planet.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	12	Yeah but effective for what?  I don't see anything positive happening over there or getting accomplished, and like you said the aggressors must know this is a fight they can't win.  Everybody loses.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	13	Control. You think the warlords at the top of the ladder aren't living like kings? That's how young men are coerced into joining unwinnable fights like this. It may be myopic, but in the short term someone is making a lot of money.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	14	Ehh, I still think it's an ineffective and pointless thing.  It's been going on for as long as history can even record with no real resolution or accomplishment.  It's just a failed endeavor.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	15	I guess it's about perspective.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	16	I reckon so.  I personally see it as totally pointless and ineffective and truly an atrocity against humans.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	17	And a far right radical Muslim sees the death of each and every blasphemer as a victory in the eyes of his God. They perceive their task as divine. I'm not condoning their behavior, I'm saying that perception is relative.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	18	Most human people, however, would see it as a monstrosity.  Have a good day, goodbye.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	2	Yeah, it is just needless and senseless suffering and loss of innocent human lives.  The ultimate tragedy really	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	3	"I mean, I can understand the whole, ""If we can't have it were not going to let anyone have it"" mindset. The resolve it must take to raze entire villages, families and resources to the ground is really something/"	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	4	Yeah, no doubt.  How do these people sleep at night?  It's gotta be an entirely different cultural mindset, I just can't even fathom it.	2.0	4.0	2.0	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	5	It's just basic dehumanization. It's used the world over to create a common enemy that doesn't deserve to share the air that you breathe. Since these people don't believe the same twisted dogma I do, I am doing them a favor by killing/persecuting them. I'm sure many of these murderers sleep quite well at night.	1.6667	4.0	3.0	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	6	I'm sure they do, it's just so ridiculous and crazy to me that other human beings can function and behave this way.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	7	It's almost anachronistic in this day and age, but these countries just haven't progressed socially or technologically at the same rate as the west due to oppressive religiosity. It's like a snapshot from 200 years ago.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
257	8	Yeah it is.  It seems quite primitive really.  The mindset, the behaviors, all of that.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	174.0	24.0	256.0
257	9	Primitive, but effective.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	174.0	25.0	756.0
258	0	That worry be horrible to be missing that many family members	2.0	4.3333	4.0	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	1	I know, I couldn't imagine being in that situation, its like a genocide there	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	10	Be force to push my son in a wheelchair until it breaks down. Those are some strong willed people.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	11	Seriously, so incredibly strong, so much strength	1.0	4.0	3.6667	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	12	it makes me think about what I complain about in my life most of the time is really nothing compared to what some people in the world are dealing with.	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	13	Exactly, its all first world problems compared to this. This is pure evil	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	14	Do you think the USA needed/needs to be in the middle east?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	15	I don't know, I have had kids from my high school die in the war so its hard for me to say	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	16	Yeah, it is a real complex problem	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	17	The rest of the world doesn't want to help thats the problem	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	18	That is very true.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	19	If they helped it would be a different story, but they don't and they just watch... same with the immigrant issue. Nobody does anything but the US	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	2	I do not know how the world fixes this.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	20	I thought some of the European countries were taking in more immigrants?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	21	I think they slowed down with taking them in and then they get forced to go back	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	22	That sucks, you have any more thoughts about the article?	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	23	No, not really	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	24	nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	25	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	3	Me neither, its crazy that the world is letting this happen in this day	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	4	Sadly a lot of this is human nature.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	5	Yes i guess history is meant to repeat itself I just couldn't imagine being put in their shoes	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	6	me either, I hope it turns out okay for most of them.	1.6667	3.6667	2.6667	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	7	Yea, I am not sure if ISIS has been defeated yet, I feel like I do not hear much about them anymore	1.0	3.0	1.3333	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
258	8	You right you do not hear that name that much anymore.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	174.0	30.0	257.0
258	9	Yea and that article was from 2016 so I do not know how it resolved but I am sure their community is damaged beyond repair	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	174.0	50.0	757.0
259	0	Reading about the crisis that these villagers are in is pretty upsetting and scary, do you think other countries should step in and help?	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	1	I can't imagine not helping in this situation. It is absolutely horrifying.	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	10	I have to believe it will be eventually. But at the same time i feel like the US has been there for the last 20 years and it is in the same spot. Maybe outside help isn't working	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	11	Hopefully it's moving in the right direction, but if things like this story are still happening, it is very far from being stable.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	12	Definitely a long way to go. But other countries that have gone through terrible crises like this have recovered so maybe hoping and believing it will get better is okay.	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	13	That's true. Love the optimism!	0.3333	3.0	2.0	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	14	Thanks, hard to be optimistic when stuff like this happens but better that than sulk. Do you think airstrikes are the right way to solve the issue, i feel like it just creates more resentment.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	15	I would think at this point airstrikes would be hard since they have all of the civilians with them. I guess if they are targeting something that is distant to them but would cause them to release the people.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	16	Yeah the impact it could have on the villagers is also incredibly scary. It seems like no matter what they are at risk of being harmed to get rid of the militants but as long as an effort is being made to free them.	2.0	2.0	3.6667	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	17	If they could somehow get the villagers away and then attack, but I don't know how they could do that. Maybe since the villagers are walking in front of the militants, they could get to them first, get them to safety and then go after the militants.	1.3333	1.6667	3.6667	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	18	Yeah maybe, hopefully they just keep the safety of the villagers as one of their biggest priorities. Don't want more people to be hurt and make the situation even worse.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	19	I just hope that something can be figured out to help those people.	1.0	3.0	2.3333	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	2	It really is, over 5,000 of them hurt taken and just used as hostages it is just horrifying. I wonder just how the government and country even let it get to this point.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	20	Yeah so do i, well it was nice talking to you even if it was about something sad. goodbye	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	21	you too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	3	I know, over 90% of the people in the village had been kidnapped.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	4	So many people, must be awful to be a family member of those taken. Just not knowing if they are safe. Just left to assume the worst.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	5	And for the people that are walking, being used as human shields. One mother was pushing her disabled son in a wheelchair.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	6	Horrifying, i really wonder why we do not here more about things like this in other parts of the world.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	7	Yeah, it's hard to believe that this kind of thing is happening in the world today.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
259	8	Very hard to believe. You would think that massive tragedies like this shouldn't happen anymore. I wonder how much longer until Iraq is a stable country,	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	174.0	23.0	258.0
259	9	Or if it will ever be stable.	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	174.0	57.0	758.0
260	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	1	I think it's horrific, using people as human shields is crazy.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	10	That is awful. i feel badly for them	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	11	yeah it's horrible. things like this probably happen on the regular over there too.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	12	That and even worse. Its really sad that everything is so terrible for those people	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	13	I think if i were there my main priority would be to leave that country by any means necessary.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	14	i agree but i think it may not be so easy for them	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	15	yeah its definitely hard to escape that	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	16	hopefully things can change and improve for them soon	0.6667	2.0	3.0	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	17	im honestly not very optimistic about that. i think that place will be a war zone for a long time	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	18	I agree. but i still am hopeful. nice talking to you, goodbye	0.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	19	you too, goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	2	I agree, its very sad	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	3	I wonder what can be done about this, I mean, there's already a war being fought. What else can be done.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	4	probably nothing except for destroying the islamic state	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	5	I wish the article mentioned when this apparently took place. It didn't even say when the article was written.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	6	im sure its something thats been going on for a while now	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	7	Can you imagine being forced out of your home and made to be someones shield in case they get shot at? Unbelievable.	2.0	4.0	4.0	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
260	8	No way. but i guess they werent given much of a choice	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	174.0	7.0	259.0
260	9	Yeah. It said 5000 people had been kidnapped.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	174.0	46.0	759.0
261	0	I found it kinda hard to connect to this article.  It's defiitely sad for the families involved.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	1	Yeah, I feel like I've been desensitized to what's going on over there. The war has been going on for so long.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	10	Oh yeah, it's ridiculously bad over there.  I just feel grateful I live in America.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	11	Yeah. These articles leave me with an almost hopeless or helpless feeling. Like I know what's going on, but because there's nothing to be done about it, I almost wish I didn't know.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	12	Yes!  Me too!  Like, what the heck?  That would be so awful on so many levels.  Ugh!	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	13	I really would like to see more positive news coming out of that area. Does it all have to be so negative?	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	14	Right? Is there nothing positive to report?  Perhaps not?  I don't even like watching movies that are set over there.  Just too depressing.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	15	Yeah anytime I hear anything about Afghanistan it's always someone was killed or something bombed, or something else to do with terrorism. I can't remember the last positive thing I've heard about in that area.	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	16	Yes it is always some tragedy.  There must be normal people living mundane lives there I would think?  I really don't know.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	17	Yeah me either. It really puts things into perspective. No matter how bad things are in the USA, it's no where near as bad as it is over there.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	18	Yes, if we're being honest I really get sick of hearing people complain about the USA.  My mom is really bad about it.  We may have our (major) problems, but honestly it doesn't even compare to some of these other places.  I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	19	ok, nice talking to you, goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	2	Yeah seriously, like as long as I can remember.  It's just sorta a constant thing.  The way they described it, it sounds like a problem without much solution really.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	3	Yeah, I don't see a solution at all. After all these years of war, it's still hell over there.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	4	YEs exactly, like they are just spinning their wheels.  And I'm sorry if this sounds bad but I don't particularly think we can afford to keep accepting more and more and more refugees.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	5	It shouldn't all be on the USA. Helping those people should be a global responsibility. I think helping them to take back their land and make it safe over there for them would be the best option.	2.0	1.6667	3.0	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	6	Yeah exactly, and it feels like we and a few other countries are the only ones taking refugees and trying to help.  I don't know, I'm uninformed about the situation.  That's just how it seems to me.	2.0	1.3333	3.0	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	7	I've heard of a few countries taking some in, but it usually causes crime rates to sky rocket. There's just no good solution.	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
261	8	Yep, exactly.  There is no good solution.  I do feel sad for people like the children involved and families though.  But what can I do.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	34.0	24.0	260.0
261	9	Nothing. There are people suffering in every country, every city. I mean, you ever hear about how bad things are in north korea? No one dares tackle that problem because of how big of a mess it would cause. What can we do?	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	34.0	46.0	760.0
262	0	Hello, how did you feel about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	1	Hi, the more I read these articles the more helpless I feel.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	10	yeah because there was a whole new problem created by that mass influx a few years ago	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	11	Exactly, foreigners that are brought in and promptly alienated/become the victims of prejudice and hatred will only curry the nationalist attitudes we are seeing today.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	12	i think there are problems with both groups.i understand the refugees feeling alienated, but i also understand the europeans being upset over the mass rapings that were happening	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	13	Huh, i'm not finding any information from reliable sources about mass rapes? Could you send me a trustworthy link?	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	14	you can google the rotherham child sex scandal and the 2015–16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany where 1200 german women were raped in one night by a roaming gang of refugees. i just wish everyone could get along	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	15	Goodness, well do you have any ideas to that affect? Helping people to get along?	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	16	I think it would have to begin with a complete overhaul of everything we have now. Greed is what motivates and that has to change	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	17	I agree, greed creates poverty and poverty is the biggest problem we have right now.	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	18	need to find a way to achieve class harmony. nice talking to you, have a good evening! goodbye	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	19	back at you! goodbye	0.6667	0.6667	1.0	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	2	Me too, I feel awful for these people	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	3	And what can you do about it? Donate to an NGO and then hear more and more about how the situation continues to worsen and  countries have accepted all the refugees they can manage.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	4	i dont trust NGOs even. I dont know what the answer is	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	5	The answer is playing out in front of us. These people will be permanently displaced, sold into slavery and forced into military service.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	6	I wish that there was another way	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	7	Most empathetic people do, but it is beyond the collective will of empathetic people to influence anything on such a grand scale.	1.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
262	8	at least a step in the right direction would be nice	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	34.0	7.0	261.0
262	9	I think the willingness of places like France and Germany to take in tens of thousands of refugees is a step in the right direction, but this kindness needs to be accompanied by infrastructure that can successfully integrate these people into European society.	0.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	34.0	25.0	761.0
263	0	Man, I would hate to live in country with that much turmoil	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	1	imagine waking up and knowing you live in that country	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	10	I agree. I like the part of the article saying that the UN needs to address the root of the problem. Lets make this countries better so people do not need or want to leave.	0.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	11	its working with some countries so i guess that is some sort of progress.	0.6667	1.0	2.6667	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	12	Can you imagine leaving everything you own and going to a foreign place?	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	13	its hard to imagine but  if it meant saving my family id probably do it.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	14	I agree, I do not think they have a choice.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	15	Its a tough life out there	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	16	Modern weapons make war so much more violent	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	17	yeah it was much more humane if that can be said in the old days when it was just swords	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	18	Like you said, a small few can ruin it for a lot of people now days	2.0	1.3333	2.6667	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	19	one can only hope for change	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	2	I hate that fellow humans have to live through this.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	20	I agree	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	21	it was a good talk. bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	22	you too. bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	3	i believe its a select few that cause all of this	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	4	Kind of, I think war and greed is human nature.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	5	we are at the end of the day related to apes	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	6	Yup and just like all animals we are territorial and out for our own basic survival	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	7	which is understandable if you think about it. family comes first	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
263	8	family comes first, but we need to think of ourselves as human family	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	30.0	262.0
263	9	its sad that we will probably never see that happen	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	34.0	19.0	762.0
264	0	Hello what did you think of the article	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	1	I'm just disgusted with this war-that we have to sacrifice our soldiers and innocents civilians as well	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	10	That's true. I just feel bad for all the innocent children being affected by this	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	11	yes, so many young lives and potential lost for nothing	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	12	They still had their whole lives ahead of them. Would you accept them in our country illegally?	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	13	I don;t know about that-but what we can do is to help them rebuild their own, because right now our own country cannot take on any more burden-we have so many issues with our own poor and homeless and the economy!	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	14	I agree, let's leave helping others up to China	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	15	yes, they have plenty of resources	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	16	do you know anyone i nwar?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	17	No, not presently, but my husband's father served in Vietnam War and saw a lot of horror	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	18	I can't even imagine. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	19	Thank you, god bless, goodbye!	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	2	It's so bad because these people are pretty much just wanderers.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	3	we have no business being there	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	4	I agree. We should let other countries handle their own business	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	5	I saw a TV program when they interviews people from Afghanistan and they said, with tears in their eyes, that their way of life was perfectly fine before we came in and brought destruction	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	6	Wow, that's so sad. We think of our country as so great but others think of us as villains.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	7	yes, we-our military are pawns and slaves who serve the evil political interests (mainly the oil or their money over in the middle east)	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
264	8	It's just all very corrupt. I wish war would just end.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	17.0	263.0
264	9	well, with Trump being held up and constantly sabotaged, I don't know when he'll ever get to it	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	34.0	26.0	763.0
265	0	What did you think about this article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	1	I was thinking how you hear about the war but not about the innocent citizens	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	10	Yeah, it didn't seem from the article that they were getting much help though.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	11	I always hear of organazations like doctors without borders who go into dangerous areas to help the citizens.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	12	I agree, those organizations exist, I just can't remember reading anything in the article about any help or hope for those people. It sounded more like the countries that they had fled to weren't doing much for them and were encouraging them to return to Afghanistan.	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	13	the fact that an entire country encourages people to go back to almost certain death is mind boggling	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	14	I thought it also sounded like some people decided to go back on their own because they felt they could be more successful there even if they had to deal with the danger.	1.3333	1.0	3.0	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	15	I wonder what is going through their head when they make that decision	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	16	I can't imagine making that decision myself, but maybe they are just trying to survive and make a living.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	17	That is true. Many people who are immigrants in america work and send money back home to support their family. Maybe it's a situation like that.	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	18	It's been nice chatting with you!	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	19	I appreciate how kind you have been! I have really enjoyed this convo!	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	2	Yeah, it's really sad for them. And I never considered that people that had previously fled would then go back.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	20	You too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	21	bye!	0.6667	1.0	0.6667	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	3	we are lucky that war is not happening in america	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	4	I agree, I hope that is stays this way in America for many years also.	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	5	yes, it is a scary thought that is hard to imagine. Having to flee the country hoping another would accept you.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	6	Can you imagine just leaving everything you have and going to another country where you might not even speak the language to start a new life? And what if you had children? I feel so badly for anyone in a situation like that.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	7	wow that is daunting. especially if you have no communication with you family. the possibilty of never seeing them again is very real	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
265	8	I think those people must be very brave. But I guess it also depends on how bad the situation is that you are living in.	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	1	34.0	57.0	264.0
265	9	that's true. it makes me happy to hear about people who are trying to help	0.0	2.3333	3.0	2	34.0	16.0	764.0
266	0	I wonder if this war will ever end, doesn't seem like it's anywhere close to ending any time soon.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	1	Not as long as Russia is propping up Assad's regime.	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	10	what's your stance on taking in refugees from these war torn countries?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	11	I think it's the moral thing to do, but there should be infrastructure in place to acclimate refugees into western society after they have been granted asylum, quotas should be more realistic based on the resources available for this infrastructure and volunteers are absolutely necessary to help move the process along in a supportive capacity.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	12	I think that would be fair. I think every country needs to step up and help out in any way they can.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	13	I think that is the only way that the problem will be addressed cooperatively. If every country is dealing with the same dilemma, people will be more likely to collaborate on a solution.	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	14	from what i have read about france and germany, taking in refugees has caused their crime rates to skyrocket	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	15	That's because there are no structures in place to acclimate the refugees as I had mentioned before. In the Middle East, rape is non-existent. You're putting people from an anachronistic ideological system who don't speak the language out into a culture that they are incapable of understanding. A transitional period is absolutely necessary for relocation on this scale to work.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	16	yeah, and any kind of infrastructure and programs to help them would cost quite a bit, i dont think many countries are willing to spend on that.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	17	Especially after the situation has already been so embarrassingly mishandled. The distrust and prejudice against immigrants has already taken root.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	18	oh definitely, not to mention news media are almost covering up some of the crimes committed by refugees, the average population has no idea who to trust.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	19	The entire world is in a sorry place regarding trust these day. Thanks for chatting! goodbye	2.0	2.6667	1.0	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	2	Can you imagine getting a msg saying to leave in 24 hours or be bombed? Crazy.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	20	Thanks for the conversation. goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	3	No, I really can't. It's hard to believe so many people are surviving in what is essentially a war zone.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	4	Can't blame them for wanting to leave and move to another country either.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	5	The thing is, I don't think they necessarily WANT to leave. It's a choice between fleeing and dying.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	6	I feel like the US should just stay out of this conflict, I don't know if the so called moderate rebels are any better than assads regime	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	7	It's Syria's problem, no the US's. Getting involved would only make things more complicated than they already are.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
266	8	It always seems like the US has to get involved in every other countries conflicts. Seems like it never ends.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	47.0	46.0	265.0
266	9	It's not that we always have to, it's that our country has global ambitions that can be furthered by taking sides in foreign conflict. The wealthy people in this country can't afford to leave well enough alone.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	47.0	25.0	765.0
267	0	hello what did you think of the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	1	i wonder how they managed to text everyone in eastern aleppo	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	10	it's stupid. Assad can handle things over there perfectly fine without us	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	11	yeah i totally agree with that	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	12	i believe those gas attacks were faked in order to make him look bad	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	13	someone is definitely doing things and make it seem like it was assad	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	14	he would have had absolutely no reason to do that especially at that point in time, i'm very skeptical	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	15	its like libya with gadaffi all over again	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	16	yes exactly unfortunately	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	17	we probably will never know who it is though that starts these things	1.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	18	i think some of us may have a pretty good idea, lol	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	19	who do you think it is	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	2	im not sure, maybe some sort of automated system	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	20	i think there are powerful elites behind the scenes in a global sense	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	21	i agree just didnt want to say lol	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	22	true lol, these things always point right back to them	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	23	i agree theres more than just this theyve done to the world	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	24	yes definitely. for centuries lol	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	25	its been a good talk bro. bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	26	you too man, goodbye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	3	yeah . what do you think about the whole situation	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	4	I think it must be awful to live somewhere surrounded by war	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	5	we are very lucky to be living here	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	6	i think so too, i feel sorry for the syrians	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	7	what do you think should happen to them	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
267	8	i think the US needs to stay out and stop making things worse	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	47.0	7.0	266.0
267	9	yeah we are always trying to be the world police	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	47.0	19.0	766.0
268	0	Syria is a real mess.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	1	I agree, I would hate to get that text message!	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	10	Yeah!  I hadn't thought of that.  Maybe it's just stray cats or something.  That would make more sense.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	11	These emphatic conversation hits have made me a lot grateful for my life.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	12	"For sure.  I almost always say that to myself at some point during the article: ""We complain a lot in the West but man... it could be worse."""	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	13	a lot worse and there is so many people in the world going through so many bad things	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	14	Yeah, the amount of people uprooted and trying to find new countries is remarkable.  I suppose it makes some sense with our technology making the world smaller (seemingly, if nothing else).  But in the Middle East, Africa, Central america.   Just amazing the number of people trying to find a new home.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	15	It makes me mad when people say they could just stay in their own country. They just want a better life for their family. I do not have all the answers but I know we should have compassion for what they are going through	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	16	Yeah, I agree.  But it's hard to know what the right answers are.  Like, I don't think we can just deal with the symptoms, which are refugees and that kind of thing.  That doesn't fix things in the long term.  But the real cause of these symptoms is stuff happening in sovereign countries, so we can't necessarily directly deal with them.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	17	True, but look how worse we made Libya. It is a very complex problem. I just pray for everybody, us included	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	18	Yeah, I'd certainly like to see it get better for everyone, even if I have no idea how that'll happen.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	19	Yeah, I think we could afford to let a little more refugees in.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	2	Yes, that would be surreal and very frightening.  Interesting that it didn't get followed up by the bombing that was warned about.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	20	Yeah, we could probably handle that.  Anyway, nice chatting with you today.  Have a good one.  bye	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	21	Nice chatting with you too! bye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	3	I wouldn't be around, I would had to take them on their word.	2.0	1.3333	3.0	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	4	For sure.  Civil wars are interesting.  Wars usually end faster when you fight them indiscriminatly, but in a civil war you don't want to completely destroy your own country.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	5	The stories about the leader gassing his own people. I do not know who is the bad guy in this story.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	6	I think they're all bad.  That's part of the problem.  But with meat at $40 per kilogram, they're probably all pretty cranky.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	7	I can not afford $40 per kilogram of meat.	2.0	1.0	1.3333	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
268	8	I wonder who's even bringing that meat in in that situation.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	47.0	48.0	267.0
268	9	and what kind of meat?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	47.0	30.0	767.0
269	0	What a disturbing message to receive.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	1	exactly idk what i would do if that was me	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	10	lot's of places have similar obligations for native citizens, like Norway and South Korea for example. Things are just a lot more dicey in the middle east.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	11	yeah very true different governments and leaders controlling things	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	12	Yep, ive heard stories of Norwegians expatriating of even committing suicide to not have to serve in the military.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	13	omg really i didnt now even norwegians had to do that i thought just places like north korea	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	14	it's a relatively wide spread practice that definitely messes with people who are pacifists. That's what's so sad about the situation in Syria. A lot of the people are civilians who are just caught in the crossfire of larger nation's political agendas.	2.0	1.0	2.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	15	Very true innocent people are being killed and scared to just live thre life day to day	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	16	How much longer do you think the fighting will drag on now that the U.S. is pulling out and allowing Turkey to advance?	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	17	I think it will drag on i dont see an end in sigh	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	18	Me either, unfortunately. Well, thanks for chatting! bye	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	19	you two bye!	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	2	leave everything you've ever known and strike out on the road I guess? It amazes me that there are even still people living in Aleppo after eight years of this.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	3	Me two i have neighbors with family there it is so scary for them also	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	4	Wow, have you ever talked to the about their feelings/desired resolution to the conflict?	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	5	I try to just comfort them they are sad they cant go home anymore	2.0	1.6667	3.3333	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	6	It must be heartbreaking. One of my best friends is from Iran and he can't go home because he'd be immediately conscripted for military service.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	7	wow really what does that mean ive never heard of that before?	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
269	8	military service is compulsory for all men of a certain age, so if he went back he would be forced into military service until he had fulfilled the required period of time. I think it's something like three years.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	47.0	25.0	268.0
269	9	oh wow so thankful to be living over here	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	47.0	53.0	768.0
271	0	How do you feel about the president's outspoken disdain for specific demographics?	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	1	I think it is very wrong and hurts the country and you?	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	10	They probably could if they tried to find an actual group of people and not just a collection of avatars online.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	11	Do you see the shooting slowing down?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	12	Pardon?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	13	Do you think the hate crimes/mass shooting are going to slow down?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	14	Why would they? Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is as prevalent as ever and no action is being taken to keep dangerous people from acquiring firearms. Do you?	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	15	I see them speeding up.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	16	It's definitely a possibility. With the coming recession tensions are only going to run higher.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	17	Do you think Trump will be reelected?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	18	I think it is a distinct possibility. The whole thing is going to be hard to watch regardless of the outcome.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	19	I agree. It was nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	2	I think it's effective for galvanizing his base, most of whom don't pay attention to politics in any meaningful way. It's a dirty way to  play, but i'd expect nothing less from him.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	20	Back at you. bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	3	Sadly, I do think is he is too different for most American presidents, but they were smart enough no to say it out loud.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	4	Therein lies the difference. He has made outspoken racists/nationalists/fascists comfortable enough to go out and steal/murder/rape and know that others like them will celebrate their actions.	1.6667	4.0	3.6667	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	5	There is a direct link between him and a lot of the mass shooting lately.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	6	Yeah, and I work in juvenile justice. These mass shooters often make a comfortable living, get married and are celebrated in prison. It's literally a career path for hateful alienated people and it's disgusting.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	7	I wish I had an answer for hate, some people just are irrational	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
271	8	I think the reality that most people are *extremely online* plays a big role in this kind of thing manifesting itself. Online communities are predominately just people patting each other on the back for their behaviors and beliefs.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	146.0	25.0	270.0
271	9	There are a lot of sad and lonely people looking for a group to join. I use they could just find one that is not hate focused.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	146.0	30.0	770.0
272	0	I found this article obnoxious.  What were your thoughts on it?	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	1	Obnoxious in what sense?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	10	Yes and social media probably feeds into that.  Not to keep blaming social media for all our problems because I certainly don't think that's the case, but I Do think it heightens the issue you are describing.  People see differences and inequalities and just have much more information than they did in the past.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	11	Yeah, don't feel bad about ripping on social media.  I think it's a real problem.  Or, as you say, it heightens all these problems.  I think it's a real problem and will be interested to see how things unfold going forward, whether people start turning away from it or they double down and more of our lives gets filtered through our screens.  The problem is it's addictive for people, among other things, and I think that makes it harder for people to decide not to use it, even when they know it makes them unhappy.	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	12	Yeah it definitely becomes compulsive for people, like an integrated and critical part of their lives almost.  Something did not really happen unless it's documented on social media.  Kinda crazy to me, but whatever.  Either way, I do think it is intensifying a lot of these problems and it will definitely be interesting to see what happens over the next century.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	13	"Yeah, I thought about that once.  Think about how much our minds now associated ""importance"" with seeing it on a screen.  We've been conditioned to think that way.  And I think it works the other way, too.  When we see something, we make it important by recording it.  A strange phenomenon, that something isn't important until it's digitized."	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	14	It is a very strange phenomenon.  And it has happened so fast.  It's crazy to think when I was a kid the only phones we had were in the house, and the computer was basically just a very simple word processor.  My kids can't even fathom it.  We used a phone book to look up a phone number.	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	15	Yeah, I was the same.  I don't even have a cell phone myself.  I'm annoyed that so few people are now in the phone book.  Some places apparently don't even have phone books anymore.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	16	Yeah I don't even know where I would get a phone book.  They don't distribute them where I live.  I have a cell phone but it stays off on a shelf unless I leave the house.  It is for emergency use when I am out.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	17	"Yeah, I don't ever judge people for having a cell phone.  I just joke that ""I'm not that important,"" which has more meaning than I let on, but I mostly mean as a joke."	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	18	LOL apparently I am not either.  But I am perfectly fine with that.  This is how I choose to live my life.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	19	For sure, great chatting with you.  I enjoyed it and appreciate your perspective.  Have a great day.  bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	2	It attempted to blame an increase in hate crimes (which it later retracted, saying they were likely at the same level as they were in 2015) on Trump.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	3	Yeah, but the media's pretty good at that, aren't they?  I don't think Trump creates anger and hatred.  He might embolden it.  Maybe.  But it already exists and is a function of our society, not one man.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	4	Those are my exact sentiments.  It is a mindset that has entered society and is probably exacerbated by social media and the rapid exchange of information, ideas, hatred, and anger that is prevalent in society today.  To blame it on Trump, one person, is just absurd.	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	5	I also sympathize fully with people who are furious after terrorist attacks.  I personally wouldn't go harass or assault an innocent person because of it, but I understand the feelings behind it, even if I don't condone the behavior.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	6	Yes, and there have been a large number of terrorist incidents that were perpetrated by Muslims.  So to me, that would explain why people are targeting Muslims in retaliation.  Which is not right at all, but it is the explanation for why that is happening.	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	7	"I guess I also feel that the notion of everyone living together peacefully and harmoniously is misguided.  There will always be winners and losers, always be some sort of ""us versus them.""  You see it in gender issues, race issues, political issues.  I think certain majority elements in our society are waking up to this and pushing back.  And I don't blame them."	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
272	8	You make a good point.  That is probably an idealistic notion that is not grounded in reality.  I do wish people would learn to live and let live a little bit more.  Just mind their own business and enjoy their lives.	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	146.0	24.0	271.0
272	9	Yes, I don't want to present too cynical and callous a view.  People can form stable societies.  But our current one likes to highlight differences and perceived inequalities, and that feeds a very antagonistic culture.  I think we know too much about each other, see too much that other people have that we don't, and it creates unrealistic expectations about how the world can possibly work.  We don't all get to have what we want.  Few, or none, do	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	2	146.0	48.0	771.0
273	0	How did you feel about the article?	1.3333	0.6667	0.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	1	I felt pretty bad reading it, with all the issues going on in the country right now i had never even though of how bad things must be for Muslims living in America	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	10	Reading over the article it does seem like its a problem that has been going on for a long time	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	11	Well Yeah the crimes has only been spiking lately but the crimes are only a symptom of race relations in the country right? Or at least thats how i see it.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	12	yeah its hard to pin what the root of the cause is	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	13	Definitely, what do you think could be done to maybe calm the racial tensions?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	14	probably more programs that bond people together. Educate people on these things. i honestly have no idea. what do you think can be done?	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	15	Yeah that could be really helpful, and i think start with kids maybe. Educate them on accepting others and seeing others as equal and hope that things change over time. I'm not to sure really.	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	16	definitely kids are like sponges and take in what their parents teach them or anyone around them. if theyre educated in time it can be prevented	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	17	Yeah for sure need to make sure that the bad ideals are not passed on. Also maybe the kids will end up teaching their parents something too.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	18	I agree it all starts at home with the parents.	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	19	Whatever the solution is hopefully it is found soon.	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	2	Yeah I never heard about the rise in hate crimes against them until now.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	20	i definitely agree on all points. its been a good talk. bye	0.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	21	Yeah been a nice conversation. bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	3	I knew obviously that there was a big rise after 9/11 happened but that the number is reaching a high once again is alarming. Makes you wonder why it is never reported on.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	4	what do you think is causing it now?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	5	I think the the current debate over immigration has a lot of people feeling a very us vs them mentality as of late. People are only seeing race right now and using that to decide american or not american.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	6	yeah that's probably it. the presidents choice of words also arent always the best	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	7	Definitely not helping matters at all. I really hope that this is the worst things will get and over time things start to improve for all Races in the US.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
273	8	maybe in the future we will all get along	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	146.0	19.0	272.0
273	9	Yeah maybe, But i feel like minorities were feeling the same way 50 or 60 years ago which makes me sort of discouraged	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	146.0	23.0	772.0
274	0	hi, what did you think of the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	1	I thought it was interesting, I had a hard time connecting with it though. What about you? What did you think?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	10	do you think it would be better if people separated themselves into their preferred groups?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	11	i think it might help, but will that overcome human nature? I mean, honestly, I just don't know. what do you think?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	12	I think maybe if people were separated and kept to themselves they may get along better. they could still trade and communicate and all of that, but just live in their own spaces	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	13	it's a shame we cant just get along and work together, need to be separated like rowdy children on the playground	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	14	I agree but I suppose desperate times...	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	15	yeah thats true, gotta do what you gotta do	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	16	i just wish there was more of a sense of community	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	17	yeah i agree, its like reading articles like this just brings me down, i wonder if thats why things like this fly under the radar as people tune it out because of so much negativity in the world	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	18	yeah i think people are becoming desensitized to everything	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	19	yeah and its causing all kinds of problems, people would rather just tune it out and act like nothing is happening, ignorance is bliss i suppose	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	2	I think it is very one sided	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	20	good talking to you, goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	21	nice talking to you too, goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	3	Oh yeah? In what way?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	4	I think they are neglecting to address what is causing this response	2.0	1.0	1.6667	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	5	Hmm, yeah I see what you mean, articles like this just leave me feeling like there isn't much that can be done	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	6	Yeah I feel that way too. Wish all people could get along	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	7	Yeah, it just doesn't seem like it will ever really happen.	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
274	8	do you think its just nature?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	146.0	7.0	273.0
274	9	it could be, but who really knows	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	146.0	46.0	773.0
275	0	hello what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	1	i think its wrong to attack people for having a certain religion	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	10	That is very true and mature of you. What do you think of Muslim people?	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	11	I haven't really had experiences with them so I can't really say. What about you?	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	12	No bad experienced here either. I definitely wouuldn't be scared or anything though if i saw one	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	13	yeah I feel like the bad ones ruing it for the majority	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	14	Definitely. I feel like that's the same thing for any race	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	15	yeah every race or religion or group in general has bad people in it.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	16	Hopefully Muslims have a better future	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	17	yeah hope so	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	18	it was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	2	It's terrible. They are getting so stereotyped	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	3	what do you think can be done	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	4	I don't think anything can be done. We just have to wait because i think children growing up now are more open and understanding to others	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	5	yeah it starts at home with parenting	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	6	I agree. Have you ever experienced anything like that? discrimination?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	7	I feel like I have more than a few times, what about you?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
275	8	I have never fortunately. I would be very angry though if it were to happen	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	146.0	17.0	274.0
275	9	yeah i probably would know not to react badly though because its what they would want me to do	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	146.0	19.0	774.0
276	0	Wow, this story really makes me appreciate the little things.	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	1	Seriously, its so sad that these poor kids are denied food.\	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	10	Ahhh, it is just so sad.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	11	I am sure very rich people have looked into helping but I don't think anybody can help them	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	12	I just can't imagine living somewhere like that and trying to raise my children and give them the life they deserve.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	13	Me neither, I have 2 kids and they get everything they want/need... I couldn't imagine it any other way	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	14	"Same here, but even sometimes I wonder ""Have I given them everything they need?"""	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	15	Exactly, I think that all the time and its about dumb stuff like shoes and pokemon cards. It makes me really appreciate what we have in this country	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	16	Yes, this story definitely makes you realize how good we have it.	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	17	I've been doing these Empathic Conversation HITS for the last 2 or 3 weeks and its so sad how people in other countries are living and I do not think many americans are aware of it	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	18	You're so right, these hits make me so sad all of the time. And if you watch our news, sometimes it seems like they are saying that our country is so terrible. If people paid more attention to what is actually happening all over the world, maybe they would realize how good we have it.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	19	Yea the only think I see on the news is about politics and its so annoying, nobody is aware of the world we live in and apparently neither am I because I didn't know about these issues until I started doing these HITS	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	2	Yeah, and no matter how good of intentions the parents may have, they are just stuck in a terrible situation.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	20	Yeah, you really have to go outside of the mainstream media to find much that is just about our country and our politics. I love watching documentaries on different cultures and issues occurring around the world.	0.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	21	I do too, its very interesting	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	22	It's been great talking to you!	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	23	Same! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	24	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	3	Exactly, I know about 30% of the kids in my son's school are provided lunch and breakfast for almost free by the government and its not the fault of the parents its just how it goes sometimes	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	4	But even if that was the case there, the kids aren't even able to get to school sometimes because they have to go stand in food lines to get food for the entire family. It's a vicious circle because they are being kept out of school so they are not getting the education that they need to eventually be able to have a better life.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	5	Yea its sad the government doesn't recognize that the children are the future and they should be provided food so that they go to school	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	6	It is all just really sad, obviously everyone there must be very hungry. I would think most people would try make sure their kids were getting food before they ate it themselves.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	7	Yea the parents probably have trouble working since they are starving as well, and that probably makes it even harder to provide for their family	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
276	8	It makes me so sad, sometimes I think I wish I could just send money to people like this but I don't really know how or if I trust organizations. What my family spends on one meal eating out would probably be life changing for people like this.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	370.0	57.0	275.0
276	9	Exactly, I think its basically impossible for people to reach out to people like this because the government is so untrustworthy	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	370.0	50.0	775.0
277	0	Not lookin' good in Venezuela!	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	1	I agree. I still feel sorry for the children and their families.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	10	I guess, but again, what's the difference between starving to death and getting shot?  At what point do you try to take control of your own situation?	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	11	I agree I rather die fighting, but I hope I never have to make that choice.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	12	Agreed, and I'm pretty sure we won't.  Or if we do, it certainly won't be because of the same causes as they are in Venezuela.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	13	America is not far off the have and the have nots, but our standard of not having nothing is a lot better than how some people are living in the world.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	14	Yeah, I think there's a big difference between having one meal per day that requires standing in food lines, and not being able to afford the smartphone you want.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	15	I wouldn't know how to tell my children that we are not eating today.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	16	Yeah.  I also wondered how long these families keep sending their kids to school at all.  At what point is mere survival more important.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	17	Yeah, there is no point of learning if you can not even feed yourself.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	18	Oh well, hopefully this gets better.  And at some point I guess it will.  I'm not sure how it looks when it does, but oppression and tyranny don't last forever.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	19	I bet if feels like a life time for the people that it is happening to.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	2	Right, I feel for them too.  Venezuela is a very wealthy nation because of its oil reserves, and yet its people are starving because of dictatorial corruption.  What can you say.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	20	Yeah, I imagine every day is a lifetime.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	21	Nice chatting with you too! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	3	Working five months for 17 dollars, WOW!	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	4	Yeah, that's wild.  And what was the number they said for what they're spending on school lunches/  $0.0007 per lunch of something stupid.	2.0	3.0	1.3333	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	5	Yeah, I'm surprised they haven't had a revolt.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	6	Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  At what point is there real revolution?  Better to get killed fighting to live than just to expire.  But I don't know what all is going on, and I know millions have already fled.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	7	It was a whole lot easier to have a revolution before guns. Now if you storm the castle your going to get shot.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
277	8	True, although we had a revolution with guns, too.  I also think there's probably a different mindset in a communist country.  Those people have been dependent on their government; it's very counterintuitive to fight against the hand that's fed you.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	370.0	48.0	276.0
277	9	We didn't have a revolution with modern guns. None of those guns could have sniped George off the boat at night with a scope. They are in a lose-lose situation	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	370.0	30.0	776.0
279	0	This was one of the saddest stories I have read so far.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	1	yeah me too.  Really heartbreaking, all these kids suffering.  And their parents feeling helpless	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	10	"well, and according to the article they have the iconic ""bread lines"" where people have to line up at a specific time just to have a chance at purchasing bare necessities."	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	11	that's so crazy to try to wrap my head around.  I am SO grateful to be an American, seriously.	0.6667	4.0	2.0	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	12	Yeah, I get annoyed by not having some ingredient that is essential to a recipe and having to run to the store, but at least there's a store to go to and food to be had. It's wild how jaded you become living such a priviliged life.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	13	yeah no doubt!  Outraged when they are out of the english muffins I like.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	14	The vast majority of Americans probably don't even know what intense hunger feels like, but it's a daily reality for these poor kids.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	15	"yeah I try to remind my kids that when they say they are ""starving"" but I know they can't even fathom what I'm talking about"	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	16	and the article mentioned that with such poor nutrition the children can't even retain any of the information their supposed to be learning.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	17	yeah, which is understandable.  How can you learn if you're literally starving?  so sad.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	18	no kidding. well, thanks for chatting with me today! bye	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	19	you too, bye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	2	Just picturing these poor little kids being so hungry they literally can't even stay awake. Goodness. I wonder how widespread the problem really is.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	3	yeah I bet it is bad.  I read another article on here about how animals at the Venezuelan zoo were starving to death, and people were slaughtering horses to eat and to feed animals.  It's really bad down there.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	4	I actually read that article too. I'm sure that the government is using plenty of resources to make sure only a fraction of what is going on down there is actually reported on.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	5	yeah no doubt.  I think their economy is one of the worst in the world, and they have an extreme political situation, too.  Isn't it some sort of horrible dictatorship?	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	6	Yeah, maduro is clinging to power because of being propped up by Cuban and Russian interests.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	7	yeah I am not informed about all that, I just know their situation is dire.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
279	8	I know that there's hyper-inflation and therefore a growing preference for crypto-currencies and that the military is making quite a bit of money by transporting cheaply bought Venezuelan gasoline to neighboring countries and selling it at an incredible profit. Then, you have the people fleeing the country only to end up in more compromising positions, but beyond that I'm pretty uninformed as well.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	370.0	25.0	278.0
279	9	I just remember learning in Economics class in graduate school that they had a serious hyper-inflation issue, to the extent that they were paying the workers several times a day bc their checks would be worthless by the end of the day otherwise.  that way they could take money home to the wives andt hey could go buy food.  ridiculous.  apparently not much has changed.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	370.0	24.0	778.0
280	0	what did you think about the article?	0.6667	0.6667	0.3333	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	1	it is so sad when it comes to kid	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	10	yeah how could a teacher go on with class like that	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	11	I dont know I would want to help so much	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	12	yeah i want to look into it and figure out how to help	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	13	I wonder if the school has a website that you could find more out about	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	14	i wonder that too	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	15	they need to have the government step in and help	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	16	or if they cant a foreign govt should step in	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	17	yes the usa could send so much relief to these kids	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	18	yeah no doubt, do you think they will?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	19	if there was enough attention im sure yeah	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	2	yeah we need to help these kids	0.6667	2.0	3.0	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	20	hopefully it gets better	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	21	I agree its been nice chatting with you today	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	22	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	23	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	3	they need some kind of aid	1.0	2.3333	3.0	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	4	yeah wonder if they can get it	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	5	if there is more awareness im sure	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	6	thats sad that they are sent to school hungry	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	7	i know and have to line up for groceries to be affordable	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
280	8	cant imagine having to do that	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	370.0	19.0	279.0
280	9	Cant imagine teaching kids who are hungry and sleepy	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	370.0	53.0	779.0
281	0	hello, what di you think about the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	1	It is sad.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	10	about 15 miles from where i grew up	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	11	Was it a big story in the area?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	12	i have no idea i dont live there anymore	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	13	I can not blame this just on mental illness he planned this out as most of people who do these kind of things do.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	14	yeah i agree i dont think it was illness	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	15	Do you have a funeral for the father? As one of his parents. he killed his own children, I do not know if I would even have his picture in my house. I know this had to be hard.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	16	im not sure how that is all handled really, would be interesting to find out	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	17	Personally would you? I say no for me.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	18	i think probably not	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	19	It would just be too soon. I do not know how to help people when they get into that kind of shape.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	2	i agree. it happened near where i grew up	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	20	i dont either, especially such a confusing and sad case like this	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	21	Any more thoughts on the article?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	22	no not really. nice chatting with you, goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	23	nice chatting with you too! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	3	I feel like the father is a real coward.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	4	yeah i agree with that	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	5	I feel that people should have the right to kill their self, it is their body and their life, but killing other people because your sad makes you a coward.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	6	yeah and so does killing yourself after killing other so you dont have to face the punishment	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	7	I agree. I know the mother and grandparents of those children are heart broken.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
281	8	i can only imagine	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	202.0	7.0	280.0
281	9	How close was it to you?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	202.0	30.0	780.0
282	0	How'd it make you feel? :(	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	1	I felt sad but at the same time angry at the man. What about you?	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	10	Yeah, I can't even imagine coming home to that. :(	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	11	Yeah.. do you think that people with severe mental illness should be allowed to have children??	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	12	I feel like that starts to stray too far into eugenics. People will mental illness are more likely to experience violence than enact it, after all.	1.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	13	Yeah, that can be a tough question. Do you know anyone with depression or suicidal thoughts?	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	14	Haha, I've had them, so yes. Not in the past five years though. :)	0.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	15	That's good to know! Glad you're doing better! Did you do anything to improve these thoughts?	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	16	Therapy's great! I recommend it to anyone, honestly.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	17	I have a bit of depression of anxiety myself but i never thought to go to therapy because i felt like it's just like talking to a friend	1.0	3.0	2.6667	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	18	Yeah, but it's a friend who super knows what they're talking about, and sometimes a perspective with a bit of distance can be really helpful.	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	19	That's true. Well it was nice chatting with ya! bye!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	2	Just. So angry, honestly. What a terrible way to die.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	20	bye!	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	3	It's terrible too because how can you kill your own children?!	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	4	I just—jeez. I wish he hadn't have been able to get a gun if he was that unstable.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	5	Yeah, exactly! I don't think the article mentioned it but i wonder what was the purpose	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	6	I mean, I don't remember where he lived, but in a lot of places in the US it's just normal to have one	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	7	Oh no i mean what the purpose of killing his sons were. I do agree though that he shouldn't have a gun!	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
282	8	Oh, gotcha. I feel like that happens sometimes, especially when it's the dad that's suicidal.	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	202.0	13.0	281.0
282	9	I just wouldn't understand the thought of killing your own children as well. Of course, i will never be able to understand but still! It feel bad for the mother... wonder what happened with her	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	202.0	17.0	781.0
283	0	This incident actually happened relatively close to me.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	1	Wow, really?  I thought it was very sad.  They didn't give many details in the story though.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	10	No, I really can't. It takes so much courage to leave an abusive relationship. Then, to have it all come tumbling down around you would make it very easy to blame yourself.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	11	yeah for sure, and she's left to pick up the pieces and deal with that.  did we talk friday afternoon?? I feel like we have been paired before.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	12	I'm not sure, but I have done quite a few of these empathy exercises over the past month or so. What makes you say that?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	13	just the way you write your responses.  I've done a ton of them too.  anyhow, hopefully she can find the support and strength she needs to rebuild her life.  I don't think I would be able to.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	14	I think it's something that would take an immense amount of time and effort to mourn properly and then confront the emotions you are feeling with an open mind and a supportive network of friends/family. The process would be absolutely daunting at the outset, but people are pretty tenacious.	1.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	15	Yeah you would definitely need a good support network.  People are certainly resilient but this woman lost everything.  So very tragic.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	16	Yeah, I lost a dear childhood friend seven years ago and i'm still processing the loss. It's really something to lose someone. I certainly wish her the best.	1.6667	3.6667	3.0	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	17	I'm sorry for your loss.  It can definitely be permanently life altering to lose someone  dear to you.	1.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	18	Thanks, it most certainly is. Well, thanks for chatting with me (again). Hope you have a great day! bye	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	19	I hope you have a great day, too!  bye!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	2	If i remember correctly, he was an Iraq veteran who suffered from ptsd and his wife was leaving him.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	3	Awww poor guy.  What was up with the domestic violence charge, though?  That made me not feel much compassion for him.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	4	unfortunately, that's a common thread for military and police alike. He didn't know how to respond to what was unfolding around him and his family paid the ultimate price.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	5	"Yeah I mean if he was a veteran, clearly he has been through a lot and was suffering.  However, I still find it hard to have sympathy for anyone who hurt their children.  Why harm them?  They are innocents.  There were other chioces he could have made to cope with what he was going through, which I""m sure was a lot."	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	6	Projection and internalization most likely. His projected his worldview onto his children and thought they would be better off dead than living through his personal hell. I'm not expressing sympathy. I rarely have any for those who harm women and children, just stating the facts that i'm familiar with.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	7	Yeah for sure, I agree with your assessment and I agree it is still hard to have sympathy for this man.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
283	8	but, I do have immense sympathy for his wife. She was trying to do the right thing by her children and they still ended up getting killed.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	202.0	25.0	282.0
283	9	that's exactly what I said in the paragraph.  I feel so bad for her, she lost her entire family.  Can you imagine.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	202.0	24.0	782.0
284	0	hello what did you think about the article	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	1	wonder why he did that	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	10	I wonder what happened to the mom... i would probalby want to kill myself after knowing what happened	1.6667	2.3333	4.0	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	11	he told her that he wasnt going to be taken alive which tells me he was thinking and was fully aware of what he did	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	12	Poor lady. Some people should not be allowed to own guns	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	13	yeah shes the one that tipped the cops imagine what she felt	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	14	True. Do you think people with mentall illnesses should be allowed to have children	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	15	probably not. what do you think	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	16	I would say no. They can't even take care of themselves.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	17	yeah its like if the kids are caring for themselves.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	18	True. Well it was nice talking to you! bye!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	2	Yeah they didn't give a reason. I'm guessing it's because of mental issues	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	3	most likely thats usually what the cause of these things is	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	4	I just find it so disturbing how someone can kill their own children.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	5	i wonder what they did to him or if they did anything at all. It doesn't justify his actions they're his sons at the end of the day	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	6	I think it said he killed himself as well as his two sons	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	7	yeah maybe they were having problems	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
284	8	Maybe he had schizophrenia, a voice in his head just telling him to do it	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	202.0	17.0	283.0
284	9	whats sad is the age of his sons. 5, and 4. Too young for any of this.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	202.0	19.0	783.0
285	0	hey what are your thoughts on this	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	1	I felt like it was very disturbing and sad. What about you?	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	10	I have suffered it myself it can really destroy people	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	11	I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are better now	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	12	I am in a good place now thank you, do you think there were more signs the mother could have picked up on	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	13	Probably not. I feel like nobody would expect their own husbands to kill their children. That is the last thing you think of	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	14	yeah that is true and he was in trouble with domestic violence before she was probably afraid of him	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	15	Do you think you are born with mental illness or something you develop?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	16	I think so and it develops over time I really feel like it is the chemicals in your brain, like when you drink coffee it prodices seratonin and makes you feel happy iwish there was a pill to do that all the time haha	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	17	That's interesting, now i understand it better	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	18	well its been great chatting! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	2	same here it seems unimagainable a father could be so evil	1.6667	4.0	4.0	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	3	Maybe he was suffering from some sort of mental illness	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	4	I wish there was more help for men suffering	1.0	2.0	3.3333	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	5	"Yeah, everyone thinks of men with depression as ""weak"" which is sad."	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	6	I agree they suffer two mostly in silence then things like this happen	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	7	Yeah. I don't think people with mental illness should have a gun	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
285	8	Yeah I agree its hard to track that when people go undiagnosed	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	202.0	53.0	284.0
285	9	Very hard! Do you know anyone with depression?	1.0	2.0	3.3333	2	202.0	17.0	784.0
286	0	Reading about that situation with the poachers was pretty upsetting. To think that the changes being made to ensure poaching ends and they are being stopped by local governments is just upsetting.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	1	Yes, although I'm not sure it was local governments, just local villagers.  Still, that must have been a horribly frightening experience.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	10	Yeah for sure, it seems like we never really hear articles that are good news or updates on constant issues. Or maybe that is that people know that those articles would not cause as much noise so there is less interest in talking about them.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	11	Yes, I certainly think that's part of it.  I'm curious what will happen to the people in the village?  The article is concerned about the cowardly police officers, and I get that.  But will there be any charges brought to the villagers for nearly killing the rangers?  I'd like to know that.	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	12	I don't think there is any good way to deal with the villagers, if it was a mob of people that attacked them then what do you do arrest them all? I think at best the rangers just now no they must be careful with that village.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	13	"Yes, that's a good point.  Unfortunately, I think it only serves to embolden and legitimize their actions.  If there are no repercussions for waging ""war"" on anti-poaching, then how can the anti-poaching side ever have any real authority and success?"	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	14	Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse.	1.3333	2.0	3.6667	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	15	Yeah, if nothing else I'd certainly be nervous to be the guy sent there, seeing how they treated these rangers.  I feel like you'd probably have to convince people associated with poaching that there's an economically viable alternative to their poaching.  The problem is that I'm not sure what that is in Mozambique.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	16	Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching. It feels bad but maybe there should be incentives for villages if the population of poached animals gets above a certain point?	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	17	Yes, that's certainly an idea.  I think it's just human nature.  It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  We can entertain ideas of democracy and harmony and enlightenment and whatever, so long as we're fed and clothed and housed.  But if our basic needs aren't being met, we're going to scrap and claw for what sustains us, broader society and the world be damned.	1.6667	2.0	4.0	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	18	Definetely, and people can only really see things for their immediate self. It is hard to think of the overall elephant population when you are now going hungry because you cannot hunt them. Oh well, even though it was about a harsh topic it was nice talking to you. goodbye	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	19	Yes, I appreciated your perspective.  It made me think.  Thanks for taking the time to chat.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	2	Yeah that could be possible, and so terrifying to just be doing your job and being attacked like that. I wonder if this is the right way to stop poaching, or if there was a better way than having people just have to grab poachers in towns like that.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	3	Yes, I'm not sure.  The whole article was a little sparse on details, which I would have appreciated.  It didn't explicitly say what the villagers were angry about, although one could guess.  And I also wondered who called for the helicopter.  Seems unlikely the rangers would have survived that scenario, but who knows.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	4	Yeah it definetely felt like the article just wanted you to just to the conclusions on your own. I'm guessing the poachers were members of the community and that caused the mob. I wonder how the poahcer even got away from them in the first place.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	5	Yes, the fact that he escaped seemed incompetent, unfortunately.  But of course that's a large part of the story.  There aren't enough resources or competence to properly deal with the issue.  And there's probably corruption, too.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	6	Yeah for sure as easy as it seems there is so much ground for them to cover and animals to protect. If only they had more resources or there was a way to stop black market trade so poachers are not incentivized to hunt these animals.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	7	Yes, I think that's one of the tacks governments are taking is to focus on the demand.  Not sure how well it's worked but they're definitely putting pressure on things like ivory demand, maybe similar to same way that there's sort of a backlash against blood diamonds.  I was curious what animals were being poached in this story.  I don't believe it said, did it?	1.6667	2.3333	4.0	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
286	8	No i don't think there was a mention of it. They only mentioned the country and the continent so the first thing my mind jumped to was to african elephants which i think are still endangered. I definitely think that there is progress being made on poaching and hope stories like this are not commen.	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	71.0	23.0	285.0
286	9	Yes, I think it's particularly disheartening when the story is of the authorities losing the battle.  I guess I feel like if nothing is currently being done to stop it, then there's the distinct possibility that change can and will happen.  But if they're already trying and failing, then it feels less likely to me that things can improve.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	71.0	48.0	785.0
287	0	I am so shocked that people that are getting the poachers arrested are getting attacked by the people in the town, you would think they would be happy to have these criminals arrested but I guess they support them	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	1	im sure there is money involved or else they wouldnt care	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	10	Because this has been going on forever, I understand when some of the animals have to be killed and somebody places a bid to kill the animal but the poaching is just ridiculous	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	11	I agree that these poachers need the money off what they kill to survive but at what cost does that have to happen	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	12	Yea, I wish there was something else to do for these community's so that they do not have to poach to survive but they would probably not stop anyway... i believe they get a lot of money for killing the rhinos	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	13	its hard for the usa to be the world police on everything but in cases like these i feel like its appropriate	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	14	Yea, the USA is always the world police but I agree america should step in for this	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	15	what do you think the consequences should be if they were ever prosecuted	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	16	I guess it depends on their role in the operation, if they are on the bottom, a few years in prison but if they are the leader of the operation i think life	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	17	i agree with that it would set a example for future offenders	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	18	yea some people probably do it because they need to feed their children while other people are living a lavish lifestyle	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	19	i agree ive heard of poachers who just do it as a hobby that is just insane	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	2	Yea or maybe their family is the poacher	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	20	Really? Thats disgusting	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	21	"yep they are already rich and just go there many times a year for the so called ""thrill"" of poaching"	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	22	Oh wow, like that doctor that killed the lion	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	23	oh wow i remember hearing about that	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	24	I am not sure what happened with that but he was just a disgusting individual	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	25	yeah i remember watching a youtube video about it	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	26	All of these emphatic conversation HITS are really opening my eyes to all of these international world problems that I have otherwise never really thought about	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	27	yeah, ive read so many of these articles now and boy oh boy did we ever get lucky to be born in the usa?	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	28	For real! It makes me really love our country	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	29	yeah while it isnt perfect what country is better? none i can think of	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	3	yeah money is the root of all evil	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	30	Nope, I love where I live. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	31	its been a great talk I agreed with you on everything. bye	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	32	bye	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	4	Exactly, the police part is shocking too, how they just fled.. what is the point in having police if they are cowards	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	5	that part made me angry	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	6	Yes, I guess they are afraid too of the organized crime	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	7	its crazy how nothing is ever done about this though	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
287	8	Yea, when we have no Rhino on the planet we just have ourselves to blame	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	71.0	50.0	286.0
287	9	exactly. no one else to blame at that point.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	786.0
288	0	I can understand this story from both sides, but I do not agree with the attack.	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	1	Yeah I don't either.  It's always distressing to read about angry mobs attacking a person.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	10	I think a lot man would buy a product if they thought it would work to grow their manhood lol.	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	11	Well sex tends to sell in general, so yeah.  But it is most likely a bogus claim no doubt.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	12	It is proven to be false, but they still believe it to be true in their culture	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	13	Yeah that's kinda sad.  Preying on people's vulnerabilities.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	14	I think the rest of the world should pay if they to keep the animals safe, I believe that is the only way to really stop the poachers. What do you think?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	15	What exactly do you mean by the rest of the world should pay?	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	16	The people who do not live in those countries should donate to that area so people do not have to kill the animals for profit.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	17	Hmm, I disagree.  I think we have enough problems in our own country to be trying to solve other country's issues, but if people want to donate they are always free to do that.  I don't think it should be cursory though.  That would be infuriating.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	18	I'm sorry I didn't say it clear. I was trying to say what you said. It would be a donation choice for the people who care about the animals. If you don't care then do not donate in my opinion.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	19	Yes, I agree with that.  I think there are foundations that exist where you can do that if you would like to support that cause.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye	0.0	1.6667	2.0	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	2	How do you feel about the animals being killed?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	20	You too. bye	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	3	I don't think the animals should be killed for no good reason, like just to take their horns and sell them for example.  Only if the entire animal is being used for meat, food, etc. like it should be.  They didn't give many specifics about that in this story.  How do you feel about it?	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	4	I don't like them being killed, but I understand. People use what is around them to make money or just killed them for protection from them.	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	5	Yeah I mean in some cases it is understandable.  I think it is a cultural thing that I don't know much about as far as Africa goes.  It's easy for me to sit here in the comfort of my living room and judge but I Don't really know what life is like there.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	6	We did the same thing in America with a lot of the animals that were here. I can not get mad at them.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	7	yeah certainly that is a part of our history.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
288	8	I wonder how the horn market got so big in China?	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	71.0	30.0	287.0
288	9	I have no idea about that.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	24.0	787.0
289	0	That's really terrible about the situation in Mozambique.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	1	Yes I agree. feel bad for the rangers and the animals	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	10	Yeah, as much as I'd hate to see it.  I wonder if it'd be better to just let these people have a bunch of rhinos to make a rhino farm, then they could just cut the horns off periodically?  Kind of like sheep and their wool?	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	11	Well since the science behind is isnt even real, theyd be better off just synthesizing something and selling it as the rhino horn powder	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	12	ooo that's true. getting some fake rhino stuff on the market.  aren't rhino horns just like our fingernails or something?	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	13	I really dont know but i know they dont have any magical power	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	14	Oh I see what you're saying.  I didn't know that they thought rhino horns had some sort of value other than for aesthetics.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	15	they think they give them sexual powers, lol	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	16	Lol well I guess Americans think that about certain things too, they're just not endangered.  ie. horny goat weed...	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	17	true but i dont think people take that too seriously here, where as in China they are very serious about it	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	18	lol China is ruining everything!	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	19	they do cause a lot of pollution lol	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	2	I wonder what the reasons for the community mob were?  I'll bet the poachers are paying off both the police, and the community.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	20	yes they do. I've heard they're starting to build giant filters now, for their air pollution problem... crazy.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	21	well i suppose thats good at least	0.0	1.6667	1.0	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	22	problem is that's a localized issue.  they need to correct their massive global warming pollution problem.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	23	yes i agree with that	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	24	Them and India.  I don't blame India too much though.  There's just a billion of them, and they're all just now being able to afford a/c, so of course they'll need the energy for all that progress.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	25	india has bad problems with just trash in general	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	26	Yeah, from what I've seen of their cities, they aren't in good shape.  Especially their rivers.	2.0	1.6667	1.0	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	27	not at all haha. it was nice talking to you! have a good day. goodbye	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	28	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	3	Yeah it could definitely be something like that	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	4	Boy that's a tough place to be if you're a ranger?  Can't get any support.  I hope the government figures this out.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	5	I agree. Before the animals are all wiped out	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	6	Yeah.  I've heard the more the animal population dwindles, the more expensive the items get.  Kind of makes the poachers try even harder.  Kind of a death cycle.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	7	That isnt suprising. It seems kind of lawless out there	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
289	8	It's the civilized world's fault too.  Especially China, their the ones buying all the ivory and what not.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	71.0	49.0	288.0
289	9	yeah they're real big on that. and the rhino horns	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	7.0	788.0
290	0	what did you think about this article	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	1	thought theyre on the wrong side for siding with the poachers	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	10	they must be starving and going crazy	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	11	that explains how they reacted to this	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	12	i wonder if any of them will be arrested for it	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	13	that will be interesting to see	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	14	those men were so strong to survive and want to go back	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	15	do you think this will continue	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	16	oh yes i dont now how they would stop it	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	17	one can only hope it gets better	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	18	I agree it has been so nice talking with you! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	2	the village people you think are on the wrong side	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	3	yes but also I see things from their perspective I'	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	4	yeah same here i can see both sides of it	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	5	yep the villagers probably profit financially from the poaching and they are poor so it helps	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	6	exactly probably felt like there life line was being cut off	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	7	yeah I dont blame them	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
290	8	but brutally beating these guys thats severe	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	71.0	53.0	289.0
290	9	yeah they went too crazy there	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	71.0	19.0	789.0
291	0	This was very sad.  55 civilians killed?  that's crazy.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	1	Yes, that seems like quite a lot.  I'm guessing it was from an air strike for it to be that many.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	10	yeah I am inclined to say we should not get involved but I think it is way, way too late for that	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	11	Right, we have to make decisions from where we stand, unfortunately.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	12	yeah exactly	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	13	I sort of feel like we shouldn't enter wars unless we're willing to fight them all-out.  Wars like WWII are brutal, but they end.  If you try to fight wars with one hand tied behind your back, it's unfair to your own troops, and it doesn't usually result in resolution.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	14	Yeah I hear that.  I think there is no really good answer to it all, I mean innocent people will end up dying regardless.  Just very sad in general	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	15	I think they said we're going to start decreasing troop numbers in Afghanistan.  I'll be very interested to see what happens to that country whenever we leave.  I imagine it won't be good.  But at this point I'm not sure there's any good solution.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	16	Yeah I agree.  There is no good solution, it	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	17	It's also possible that the Taliban, in whatever form it currently takes, is mostly pissed off about U.S. presence, and if we leave they could theoretically make some attempt to reconcile with the Afghan government.  But who knows.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	18	Yeah I totally agree.  Is it possible we are just making things worse?  Anyway, it has been great speaking with you.  I hope you enjoy your day, goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	19	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	2	yeah it must have been	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	3	These wars where we try to isolate the enemy and spare the civilians drag on and on.  Guerilla wars and insurgent wars.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	4	yeah seriously.  It seems like so much needless killing, like those were 55 innocent people with lives, personalities, etc.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	5	Yes, it's hard to imagine what that would be like to live in a warzone.  It's one thing to sign up to do that.  But when one comes to you it's another story.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	6	yeah exactly.  u.s. troops died too but they kinda went into things knowing that could happen	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	7	Those were two very experienced and relatively high-ranking troops.  Interesting that it wasn't lower ranking people, who are more plentiful.  Although maybe the operation was skewed because it was a joint exercise.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
291	8	yeah kinda hard to say.  I don't know much about all that.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	242.0	24.0	290.0
291	9	It is a tough question about what to do with these places, however.  If we leave I doubt the government will hold up to Taliban forces.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	242.0	48.0	790.0
292	0	After reading that article i think what makes me the saddest is hearing that the Doctors Without Borders facility was hit during the morter attack. Volunteers who just wanted to help people, terrible.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	1	Imagine going out of your way to help the  people in need and it turns out you end up dead. That is terrible.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	10	Yeah they definetely wouldn't. I know that there is a good reason for the US to be there and they are trying to improve things for the citzens there. But when i read about the loss of lives like what happened with the soldiers also it makes me question our involvement.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	11	yeah we need to stop trying to be the world police	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	12	Yeah it seems like while it may help people in the short term in the long term it just makes everyone resent us more.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	13	yeah it would be best to focus on our own problems	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	14	Definitely, as selfish as it sounds those countries may just need to fix their problems without us cause we may just be making things worse. Or at least let organizations like Doctors Without Borders help where they can	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	15	yeah let the organizations help and let their leaders fix their problems	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	16	I just hope that the organizations are able to protect themselves, after what happened here i could see them being unwilling to go to certain places out of fear for their safety, which makes sense.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	17	they would definitely need some sort of security in these dangerous places	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	18	Yeah either security or guarentees from leaders or governments that they will not be harmed in anyway, but even then that only goes so far	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	19	I definitely agree with that. It's been a good talk. bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	2	So terrible, and incredibly upsetting. I find it so hard to believe that anyone could knowingly target something like that or a hospital or something. It just seems wrong.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	20	Yeah was nice talking to you. goodbye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	3	i can only imagine what their loved ones are going through. They would not have expected this in a million years.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	4	Definitely, it must be their worst nightmare come true. It makes me wonder whether or not people can still believe in their side of the conflict when they are attacking volunteer hospitals.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	5	what do you think is their reasoning behind the attacks?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	6	If i had to guess it is just a message to get out of the country or something like that. I could not think of anything else.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	7	at least hopefully they realize there is better ways to get that point across	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
292	8	I would hope so, I want to believe that they did not know what the building was or it was amistake that it was hit but that may be wishful thinking.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	242.0	23.0	291.0
292	9	probably something like that is what they would say. there is no way they would admit to doing it on purpose honestly	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	242.0	19.0	791.0
293	0	I know war is war, but I still do not like this.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	1	No, it	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	10	 We made our point in the middle east, I think it is time to pull the troops out.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	11	I can see both ways. I can see how it can cause problems being there for too long, but also leaving the area might allow problems to rise back up.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	12	I wouldn't mind having troops stay if that is what the people of that country want.  After 9/11 I do not think there will be a major attack like that again, so the terrorist are not a threat to us.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	13	I wish I could believe that. Why do you think nothing like that will happen again?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	14	Look at all the rules at the airport and the patriot act. They are on top of it in my opinion. , I still believe it may be a small scale attack but nothing large like 9/11.	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	15	I would hope so, but I think the terrorists are constantly trying to think of new ways to commit terror, even biological and chemical attacks.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	16	Yeah I agree, I worry more about China and Russia when it comes to those kind of attacks.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	17	I appreciate your optimism! It makes me feel a little better.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	18	Currently I'm more scare of an home grown mass shooter than a out of country terrorist. It makes me sick to have to worry about my kids at school.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	19	That's what makes me still worried about terrorist attacks, because when you see what some of these kids do and no one can stop them, I don't see how we can stop terrorist groups that have much more capabilities and access to weapons.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	2	I think this makes more terrorist, what do you think?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	20	I think the government watches the terrorist more and the kids slip through the cracks, but you could be right too.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	21	I just feel that in most of the instances, home or terrorist, our government is always reacting, like remove your shoes at the airport because there was a shoe bomber. Or the kid had a lot of signs that he was going to do something but we couldn't do anything because he hadn't committed a crime yet.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	22	I'm torn between protection from terrorist and restriction of my freedoms. How about you?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	23	I am too, but if restricting my freedoms is keeping myself and my family safe, I can tolerate some to a point.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	24	I calmed you down and you got me worried lol.	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	25	Sorry! Maybe we just met somewhere in the middle! It's been nice talking to you.	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	26	you too! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	27	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	3	Sorry, I accidentally hit enter before. I think you're right, and the people that you are fighting for are more likely to turn against you too.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	4	It's okay, I know mistakes happen.  We killed more civilians than terrorist with that air strike	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	5	And I think it was supposed to be a training mission for Afghan forces, which seems like a complete failure.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	6	I would want to get some revenge if you killed someone in my family.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	7	Definitely, the civilians were probably not being harmed as much by the Taliban. Their main enemy is probably the people fighting against the Taliban.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
293	8	I think as a society as a whole we do not value others lives as much as we should. What do you think?	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	242.0	30.0	292.0
293	9	I think people mainly care about themselves.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	242.0	57.0	792.0
294	0	I can't believe that we're still fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan...	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	1	I can, unfortunately.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	10	Yeah they're definitely lost in the middle of all this conflict.  And it's hard to blame some of them for developing a resentment of us and the western world.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	11	That resentment will live on for generations. Foreign powers make their home unlivable and then refuse them when they try to leave.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	12	And you know they know we're using them for their oil.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	13	We can't move away from the stuff quick enough.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	14	i know it would solve so mny of the worlds problems if we could get away from oil.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	15	Wealthy people will always find a reason to sacrifice the poor. In 100 years it will be for water, etc, etc	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	16	It is pretty remarkable the lengths humans will go to to attain/preserve their power.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	17	Much further than they will go to be happy	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	18	Yeah it's almost an addiction.  An addiction that makes them lose touch of their humanity.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	19	We're a cursed breed, to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting! You were a delight. bye	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	2	I'm sure when Bush said that we were gonna go get those evildoers back in 2001, there weren't a lot of peole that thought we'd still be at it twenty years later.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	20	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	3	Civilians? No. The military contractors, oil barons and politicians were counting on it.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	4	This is true.War is big business.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	5	Yep, human lives are nothing weighed against big piles of money.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	6	When you listen to the guys with the boots on the ground though, they tell a different story about how they need to be there.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	7	I only have one living relative who served. The vehicle he was in ran over an IED and he was the only one who survived. He now requires static pulses directly applied to his spinal column to feel/use his lower body.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
294	8	damn.  that sucks.  I hate hearing that kind of stuff.	2.0	3.6667	1.3333	1	242.0	49.0	293.0
294	9	The thing is, he's not bitter about it at all. The article hardly mentions the Afghan civilians who were murdered, who didn't sign up for this kind of horror	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	242.0	25.0	793.0
296	0	This refugee issue seems to be a big deal in many parts of the world.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	1	what do you think should be done?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	10	Yes, it certainly could Africa.  I also thought it was interesting that France promised space for 12,000 and then cut it off before that.  I wonder what prompts such a decision.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	11	pressure from the people that are fed up probablyh	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	12	Yes, certainly could be that.  Again, another reason why I think the people's input should happen before government starts dealing with these large groups.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	13	Yeah, it seems the governments have an interest in letting this happen all across Europe though. Heck, even in our own southern border we've been getting African immigrants. It seems people from Mexico don't even cross to the US anymore it's all central american and african immigrants. I wonder who's sending them.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	14	Yeah, I don't know.  But I fear it's going to be a bigger and bigger problem as transportation and communication become easier and make people, including large groups, more mobile	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	15	yeah it seems like technology makes it easier for these people to come together	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	16	I think it's also easier for them to see other lifestyles and cultures and understand that there are better lives elsewhere.  That encourages them to flee.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	17	they watch TV and see these first world countries living big and want to live that way.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	18	"Yes, I think that's part of it, and part of this growing trend to see the world as ""borderless,"" which it's not."	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	19	if the world was borderless we'd be like the wild wild west all over again.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	2	If nothing else I think countries that are likely destinations for large groups of refugees should decide, democratically, how they want to deal with them.  But those decisions need to be made before thousands are standing on your doorstep.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	20	Absolutely.  We have to have laws, whether people like recognize that or not.  People would not prefer true anarchy.  Anyway, good chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	3	the ones that do go to your doorstep should be sent back and apply at the embassy of the country they want to live in, or something like that	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	4	Sure, I think it should definitely be recognized that the refugees have no inherent right to what they're seeking.  Countries have every right to take none of them and send them away, to apply elsewhere or just to go away.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	5	Exactly. Listen I'm all for being tolerant but we have a lot of problems at home already we can't just let everyone in. Can you imagine that.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	6	Absolutely.  We live by laws and borders, for the betterment of the most.  We have to keep doing that.  And I think a nation's and a government's first responsibility is to its own people.  As I say, I'd like a democratic process to decide how countries deal with these issues.  Let the people decide whether they want masses of refugees coming in. Why isn't that the people's say?	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	7	Yeah we have no problem helping other countries get better. We should just focus on making their countries better.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
296	8	I'm curious as to where these refugees were from.  They were staying in Calais, which is in NW France, across from the UK.  It said their homes were burning.  That seems like a weird place for a refugee camp, or for people to be coming as refugees.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	339.0	48.0	295.0
296	9	I'm guessing Africa? I know Africa has many many African immigrants. I watch a lot of soccer and most of the French players are of African ancestry, also watched a few docs about that situation.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	339.0	19.0	795.0
297	0	Well, I had mixed feelings about this.  What did you think?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	1	Me as well.  I feel bad for these people, but I don't necessarily blame the governments.  There is a massive influx of refugees globally, and no existing programs can handle them all.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	10	Eritrea and Somalia.  I had forgotten, sorry.  But yeah, you totally do have to be very careful.  And this might be horrible to say, but I would imagine the conditions were still better than those they came from.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	11	Sure, otherwise they'd just go back right?  At least this place gives them some sort of hope?	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	12	that was my thinking, too.	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	13	Maybe that's terrible of us to think, but I feel like it's the truth.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	14	I feel like it is the truth.  Google claims the camp began to grow, with migrants from iraq and afghanistan showing up.  Then things like fights and violence began to break out amongst the people.  it apparently became a big problem.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	15	Again, I hate to say it, but what is with this region of the world?  I'm sure I sound like a bad person, but I just feel like the religion of Islam lends itself to some pretty crappy conditions.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	16	No, you don't sound bad.  I agree.  I don't understand what is going on over there.  It all seems so negative.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	17	I was at the zoo with my son the other day in florida, and the heat index was almost 110.  There was a muslim couple there and the woman was completely clothed in her hijab, and I just felt bad for her.  What kind of religion forces people to swelter in the hot dessert sun?	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	18	Yes that's a great example.  It just seems backwards and irrational, and inhumane.  Anyway, I am very grateful to be an American in the USA.  It has been a pleasure speaking with you, I Hope you have a great rest of your day.  goodbye	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	19	you too! bye.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	2	Yes exactly my thoughts!!  I feel bad for them too, but who is supposed to be funding their care	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	3	Yeah.  I get that they're not in great conditions, and that sucks, but it's asking a lot to suddenly create good living conditions for so many people.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	4	Yeah totally.  It is unreasonable to expect really.  Again, who would pay for it?  Taxpayers?  that's not really fair.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	5	Yeah, and I know people don't like to hear this, but it really is compounded by the fact that many of these refugees come from areas that harbor terrorists.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	6	yes very true.  I googled and it said a lot from that camp were from syria and surrounding areas	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	7	I was wondering that.  I didn't really know where Calais was, so I didn't know where these people were from.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
297	8	Yeah it was in france in 2015-6, and the majority were from syria and two other countries I have not  heard of	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	339.0	24.0	296.0
297	9	Ah.  Yeah, people don't like it, but you do have to be shrewd when allowing people in from an ISIS controlled area.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	339.0	49.0	796.0
299	0	Hi there, what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	1	It was interesting I think they should deport them	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	10	That's true. We have our own problems here as well	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	11	yes our own cities look like third world countries in some places	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	12	We also have children starving in America as well	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	13	yes we need to feed them and kick out these illegal infestation	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	14	I wonder if our next president will make immigration illegal	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	15	he should we have enough	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	16	I would feel bad for them because they have no where to go	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	17	yes they do back to their own country they need to solve their own problems or die trying	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	18	Interesting. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	19	be	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	2	Did you feel bad for the people in the camps?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	339.0	17.0	298.0

299	3	not really they made a poor choice in life	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	4	Aww, what was the poor choice you think they made?	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	5	their parents are dumb	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	6	I still feel bad for the children though living in those conditions	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	7	I suppose but you can't save them	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
299	8	I wonder if there's anything we can do to help	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	339.0	17.0	298.0
299	9	we need to help out our own citizens	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	339.0	33.0	798.0
300	0	what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	1	my heart goes out to these innocent kids	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	10	yeah the central american immigrants just cross across mexico and the usa and blame those countries for not allowing them to cross	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	11	"we have war veterans who are homeless but if someone say something bad about allowing ""poor"" Mexicans in, oh boy, you're the enemy!"	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	12	well it used to be Mexicans in the 80's, they don't cross anymore now its countries like Honduras and El Salvador crossing.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	13	yes, even worst-full of crime and uneducated, they want these people here so they can vote and elect corrupt government who will control the population!	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	14	back to the topic. I hope these kids get help	0.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	15	I do too, they don;t deserve this!	0.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	16	yeah kids are innocent and dont think for themselves	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	17	hopefully they will have a chance at better life once they make it out of this situation	0.0	2.0	2.6667	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	18	unfortunately we can't really do much from over here	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	19	we need to focus on us now, or we will end up as migrants ourselves!	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	2	its crazy how people let this happen	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	20	true amen to that	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	21	thank you for talking with me today, God bless you and goodbye	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	22	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	3	these children are just pawns in the game of war, corruption and politics-shame on the French authorities	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	4	do you think anything can be done at this point	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	5	people of France need to protest and go in there and do something, however, it's a greater problem-France should have never allowed them to come in the first place! We cannot continue to solve problems of immigrants but rather help them fix their own country so they don't end up in this situation in the first place!	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	6	i cant speak for t he french but i wouldnt want so many immigrants maybe a few but not that many	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	7	no, I fully agree with you-we have to take care of ourselves before helping others, otherwise everyone goes down!	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
300	8	Another thing is, everyone expects America to help in these kinds of situations and its time they help themselves and we look after our own first	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	339.0	19.0	299.0
300	9	amen to that! Look at our economy-disgrace, we have homeless camps in San Fransisco and yet we allow Mexican immigrants to march over and pay their rent, medical and food-no words!	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	339.0	26.0	799.0
301	0	what did you think about the article	1.3333	0.6667	0.3333	1	347.0	19.0	300.0
301	1	I was so moved and horrified for these children and people in this area how tough life is	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	347.0	53.0	800.0
301	10	yeah it has its faults but youre much better off here than elsewhere	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	347.0	19.0	300.0

301	12	yeah the fact that water is necessary for life makes it scary that youd be forced to gulp that dirty water down	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	347.0	19.0	300.0
301	13	especially growing children they are so malnourished cant see a great quality of life after	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	347.0	53.0	800.0

304	6	the best	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	347.0	33.0	303.0
304	7	I agree	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	347.0	30.0	803.0
304	8	we cant help these animals	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	347.0	33.0	303.0
304	9	I guess not	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	347.0	30.0	803.0
305	0	Hi! What did you think of the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	1	i think no humans should struggle with starvation like they are	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	10	I'm grateful to live here every single day of my life.  We really struck the lottery being Americans.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	11	one in a billion chance and we made it.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	12	seriously.  It honestly annoys me to hear people complaining so much about america.  I get that we have our issues, but you have plenty of food and can express your opinion freely and walk around without worrying about  being bombed randomly all the time.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	13	yeah man even people on minimum wage live like kings compared to the average nigerian or venezuelan.	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	14	yeah they probably make more in an hour  than those people do in a day or a week	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	15	yeah we are not perfect but much better off than these nations with ton of problems	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	16	yeah that's my feelings for sure.  oh and north korea too	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	17	yeah north korea is crazy bad.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	18	yeah it is!! well it's been great talking to you, have a good afternoon!  bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	2	yeah for sure, it's outlandish that that is even happening this day in age	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	3	yeah 2019 and it feels like Nigeria is from the year 1419	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	4	Exactly!  what the heck.  so sad for the people there, like what options do they even have?	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	5	yeah literally no options the government is too corrupt beyond repair there	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	6	oh yeah, I think they are one of the most corrupt there is, and the whole nation is rife with problems	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	7	yeah I think they're up there with the worst countries	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
305	8	yeah along with maybe venezuela	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	347.0	24.0	304.0
305	9	yep they make usa look like paradise	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	347.0	19.0	804.0
306	0	what did you think about the article?	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	1	I thought the article detailed the atrocities in Aleppo quite well.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	10	thats tough to worry about your family in Syria like he/she probably does	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	11	I feel quite badly for him. He is actually pro-Assad and so are his family members.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	12	wow you would think he would be anti assad. well according to the media assad is a bad person but i dont know i cant judge if im not there	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	13	He says that we get an extremely biased viewpoint, and that the war is over a natural gas pipeline with competing interests (The U.S. versus Russia).	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	14	i wouldnt doubt that tbh	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	15	He has actually thinking about moving back there to be with his family which is hard for me to understand with all of the chaos going on over there.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	16	that is crazy	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	17	I know. He has very strong emotions, of course, and when I see how emotional he gets it really bothers me too.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	18	its understandable since he was born and raised there to feel patriotic about it	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	19	I agree. I hope that some peace can come there soon. It is just so hard to see so much violence going on around the world in places like Syria.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	2	Yeah, quite scary 70 year olds deal with that.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	20	its crazy what bad humans can do in this world	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	21	I really think in lots of ways we want the same things for ourselves and our families we just fight over things that really should not be fought over in my opinion. I think that you might need to do something according to the instructions.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	22	what do you mean?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	23	I think we've had a good conversation don't you? It's been great chatting with you. Bye!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	24	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	25	bye bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	3	It is a shame that the innocent have to suffer in war.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	4	yeah it is definitely depressing to read	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	5	Do you have any friends from Syria?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	6	no, do you?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	7	Yes, I have one good friend from college from there.	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
306	8	whats their situation? are they in america or syria still	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	48.0	19.0	305.0
306	9	He lives in the United States, but he has family and friends that live in Syria.	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	48.0	9.0	805.0
308	0	HI. Isn't it unfortunate that this is happening to people in 2019?	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	1	It's straight up depressing.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	10	Yeah I hadn't either. I knew of the Syria crisis in general but thought people were being taken to countries in Europe.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	11	Same here - knew about Syria in general but not really anything specific. Except maybe that Canada I think was taking some refugees?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	12	I don't know either. I researched quickly and see why the doctors are fleeing. A hospital was bombed two weeks back. Crazy. We're such a violent lot of animals.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	13	Hard agreement there. It's so nuts, like why? If they're in the hospital, they're not coming after anyone. It's horrific.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	14	Evil. I can't think of a better word. I guess they're using phone data to chat through Skype. Surprised no one's blown up the cell towers.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	15	Yeesh, because the people in Aleppos aren't deprived enough already. I mean there's always more to lose. I came here for a good time and now I'm sad.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	16	Same. I was making good money and this story puts a downer on the day. I hope more countries in that area take some people in. I can't believe other Middle Eastern countries aren't taking refugees. Or I assume they're not since I never hear about it.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	17	Literally the only thing I have really heard about Syrian refugees is the polarizing arguments on why the US should/shouldn't take them in. Whoever wrote that article is doing good work getting that information out.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	18	Yes! That's all you hear about here is people squawking about taking those on the brink of death and/or starvation in. It's embarrassing sometimes. People don't realize it doesn't have to be forever. Just maybe until the war is over and the area is rebuilt.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	19	It is embarrassing! Like look around yourself and see how good you have it! There's so much excess, why is it so hard to share your space with people who are terrified and trying to find sanctuary?	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	2	I know I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly behind.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	20	I think it's easy to have that mentality if you've never seen it up close and personal for some people. I have some people like that in my family and I know their opinions would change if they area had to stay in such a place for any period of time. I think this is our last turn?	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	21	"Haha, roundabout way to end with the whole ""ignorance is bliss"" theme. And all that. So then you start with a bye and I say bye after that, right?"	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	22	Laugh out loud yeah. Ok, thanks for the chat. Bye.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	23	You have to do it in all lower case, haha. It's been good talking to you, too!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	24	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	25	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	3	I mean, survival instinct is probably a hell of a drug. But I concur. I just picture some sweet old man and his wife in the middle of a warzone, starving themselves to feed the kids.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	4	Yeah. I understand logically why that would be an option but I just can't imagine it. And especially when there's a food and fuel shortage.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	5	I can hardly imagine working my entire life to provide for my loved ones only to watch it all get flushed down the toilet like that.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	6	Yes. And then not having access to basic medications. There seems to not even be a safe zone for doctors to treat anyone.	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	7	Right? I feel like medical areas are a generally respected safe zone by both sides, but then again I've never been in war so.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
308	8	True. Seems like it would be. I haven't kept up to date with this story but I wonder how these people are getting into Turkey. Are they crossing illegally or being given refuge? I'm not sure.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	48.0	38.0	307.0
308	9	I hadn't even heard of this story before this HIT. Ignorance is bliss and all that.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	48.0	6.0	807.0
311	0	Well I thought this was a very avoidable tragedy.  What did you think?	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	1	Definitely. I just feel terrible for the dog.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	10	Yeah totally, what is up with people leaving living beings in their cars!?	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	11	Yeah! I've been hearing so many stories of babies being locked in cars out in the heat. It's crazy	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	12	It is absolutely crazy!  It's like there's a story or more every single week	1.3333	3.6667	3.0	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	13	Yeah, at least there are decent people around to break the windows.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	14	Yeah sometimes there are	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	15	What would you have done if you saw the dog in the car?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	16	I would have called 911, how about you	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	17	I think i would have just broken the window lol	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	18	lol I hear you, I'm pregnant and have a baby, two toddlers, and another child so I don't really want to be smashing glass right now but I'd definitely call for help	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	19	Oh wow, calling for help would definitely be the better choice for you. Well it was nice talking to you!	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	2	Yeah, it was just totally helpless in the car to suffer.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	20	You too, have a great day, bye!	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	3	So do you think the officer should be punished even though it was an accident?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	4	Yeah for sure, I do.  It was an accident but she should have known and remembered the dog was there.  she was resonsible for it.  what do you think?	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	5	I agree. Although accidents happen and i honestly don't think she should be punished for it though	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	6	Yeah maybe reprimanded and banned from handling any more dogs	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	7	That's a good enough punishment. I have a dog myself and i can't even begin to imagine how i would feel if this were to happen to me	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
311	8	Yeah no doubt, I don't have dogs but still I would think it's like your children, like you need to know when they're with you or not	1.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	24.0	310.0
311	9	Yeah overall, it was just very tragic and sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	291.0	17.0	810.0
313	0	Hello	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	1	Hi, I feel awful about this story.  What a terrible thing to happen to a police dog.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	10	It was 38 and I just do not believe you leave him in the car.   With all the media hysteria, he can't hide for sure.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	11	Maybe he was punishing the dog or was sick of him or something.   I think those dogs live with their handlers.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	12	Sounds like sick of the dog.  Just tie him up outside.   I can't relate honestly	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	13	Yeah, I don't get it, whether it was intentional or unintentional.  That hurts the police force, too.  Those dogs aren't easy to come by and I'm sure the officers love having one on the force.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	14	They are not easy to come by.  My son-in-law is a Seal and had difficulty in obtaining well trained dogs	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	15	Yeah, that's part of the reason I said this guy must be ashamed to see his fellow officers.  He just killed a partner, valuable resource and protector of them.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	16	Absolutely correct.   I know we are suppose to write 10 sentences each but I am running out of comments	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	17	Did you ever lose a dog?  I did when I was younger.  She got lost and I dreamed about her every night for a month.  It sucked.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	18	"I had a dog that we all loved so very much.   His name was Blackie.   We had a visitor and their little boy was ""teasing"" him with a stick and he snipped at him.   My dad said if a dog bites once he will bite again and he gave him away.  I do not know if that is correct but we were devastated."	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	19	Wow, yeah, that would have devastated me.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Dogs certainly become members of the family and it's awful to lose them.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	2	It is so very terrible.    Between people leaving their kids in a car and animals, a greater punishment is needed for it to stop.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	20	Yes it is.   Well according to the instructions I am leaving the chat with a lower case word.  Then you said it lower case and answer the exit question.   It has been a pleasure today.   goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	21	Yes, nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	3	"I wonder what happened.  If it was willful negligence or just a really ""bad accident"" as the sheriff said."	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	4	I just do not think you leave a large animal in a vehicle and never see it or it barking continuously.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	5	I agree, but I wonder what the procedure is for taking the dog out of the car.  I mean, there must be times when the cops have to get out to attend to something and have to leave the dog inside.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	6	Where was he for 38 hours that he would not have come back to the car?  I agree.  Police have procedures for everything.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	7	Wait, was it 38 hours for the Arkansas one?  The other one was 5, I think.  But yeah, if it was 38 hours then he must have just forgotten the dog in the car, which is absurd.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
313	8	Oh I thought the dog was 5 years old and he had been a handler for 3 years?	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	291.0	8.0	312.0
313	9	Yeah, maybe that was it.  Those numbers are definitely correct that you just mentioned.  I just don't remember how long the dog was in the car.  But I bet that cop is ashamed to show his face at the precinct now (although he's currently on leave).	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	291.0	48.0	812.0
314	0	i think the owner should be charged	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	1	I agree - no way you just leave a dog in a car and forget about him.   What a horrible way for the dog to die (:	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	10	so crazy its hard to believe that its real life sometimes with these laws	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	11	Agreed.    Harming animals intentionally is a psychopath in the making	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	12	they are already psychopaths probably tbh	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	13	I agree.   It seems like the world has changed so much but it probably hasn't.   We just have 24/7 news coverage on a loop.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	14	yeah and with social media a racist rant or a violent killing is caputred on video and posted within seconds	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	15	Social media is a dark place.   This upcoming generation of children are being seriously harmed and parents are clueless	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	16	exactly. will you or do you let your kids use social media?	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	17	I did not let my daughter have a phone until she was a freshman in college.   My daughter is not allowing her two daughters/my granddaughters have it until then either.   She is considering a flip phone for home use only that she can only call on -  nothing else.  Proud of her for that.	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	18	that is a great way to do it. I will be doing the same its the only way to go.	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	19	"Absolutely.   She currently is running a chapter for parents to see what all psychologists have already reported.   Their frontal cortex is not read to see what you see.   You can't unsee it.    Kids are committing suicide because of bullying.   They are all obsessed with ""friends"" likes and thinking what is posted is their real life.   It's all a fraud"	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	2	Man imagine the last moments struggling to be cool under all that heat	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	20	yeah I personally have a niece who cut her wrists because she was bullied online. She no longer is allowed to have a phone because of that. My sister messed up letting her use the phone in the first place.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	21	I am so sorry to hear that - I hope she's doing better.   Heck, even as a middle aged person you see photos of a party or something and think why wasn't I invited.   I can't even imagine what a kid would think	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	22	Kids just cant handle it at that age it becomes too much. I'm definitely taking your advice when my kids are of age and give them a flip phone. Better to be safe than sorry with social media! Its been a great talk. Have a great day! bye	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	23	same here.   goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	3	Hard for me to even begin to know what that looks like.  There was another case as well	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	4	yeah this definitely isnt the first case ive read of this!	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	5	Me either - I don't believe any of the cases where children or animals are left in cars to die is an accident	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	6	imagine being that arrogant to believe nothing will happen to a living person or animal if you leave them in a hot car	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	7	It's horrendous.   Absolutely nothing is done for the most of them.   It's as if children's lives mean absolutely nothing.   Common sentences are community service are 18 months in jail with 6 mos suspended etc.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
314	8	jesus thats just terrible. someone could actually want to kill their child because of whatever reason and just leave them in a hot car and they know the police would turn it to a simple accident! how crazy is that	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	291.0	19.0	313.0
314	9	It's very crazy.   It makes me so mad every time I hear nothing has been done.   It's the same with children that are killed in violence.   What's the difference between a child and an adult when it's willful?	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	291.0	8.0	813.0
315	0	hey thoughts on the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	1	hi I thought it was kind of sad that the dog died	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	10	animals are so fragile an innocent stories like this are just so troubling	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	11	I don't know if they were right to characterize it as an accident, doesn't seem like the right word	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	12	True maybe a more thorough invesitgation should be done further then them trying to cover there butts	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	13	I'm pretty sure it takes a lot of time and effort to train drug dogs	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	14	true that	0.3333	1.3333	2.6667	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	15	"""paid administrative leave"" see that phrase too much"	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	16	sorry i meant to say true that is why i cant understand why he would do it on purpose i thought these dogs become like there partner, but also what a big thing to just forget as an accident	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	17	oh, I didn't mean it was on purpose, just that, accidents are different from negligence	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	18	Oh yes I see that I wish there was more background provided as so many factors can tell this story just lefting piecing it together in our heads	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	19	yeah not a lot of info to go on	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	2	I did as well totally preventable	2.0	1.3333	2.6667	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	20	it was nice chatting! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	3	how could they have prevented it	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	4	better safety and procedures from the handler	0.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	5	yeah that makes sense, perhaps also better oversight	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	6	True maybe this will make them come up with better ones	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	7	well I mean, that there is more accountability for the wellbeing of the dog. Like some impartial person who checks	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
315	8	I agree I think I can see both sides of it just so sad	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	291.0	53.0	314.0
315	9	yeah its really sad, the poor dog, had nothing to do with it	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	291.0	52.0	814.0
316	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.0	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	1	It was pretty interesting to read that. What do you think?	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	10	It's huge where I live.  I am ok with it if there is a purpose and it is a species like deer that is very populous and needs control.  And you're going to eat the meat and use the parts.  Hunting just to kill things like a giraffe for a trophy or an endangered species is unacceptable to me.  What do you think?	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	11	yeah like the millionaire poachers who just go to Africa to kill Lions and other animals for the thrill of it. They are already rich and do it as a hobby. Thats terrible.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	12	Yeah I think that is terrible too.  And post these pictures of it online glorifying their kill.  How sick.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	13	yeah like that doctor that posted that picture of the animal he killed a whlle back. Thats sickening	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	14	Yeah I think I remember the one you are referencing.  It made national news.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	15	Yeah I think I saw it on the news. What do you think should be done about those type of people	1.3333	1.3333	0.3333	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	16	Legislation would have to be changed.  There would need to be laws banning that type of hunting for sport.  I would support something like that, although it would be very difficult to categorize all the different types of animals.  What do you think	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	17	I think creating laws that go against that type of behavior is the first step the problem is money talks and these rich poachers would try their hardest to stop it.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	18	Yeah I can't see that ever passing.  Well it has been interesting talking to you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.3333	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	2	I was a little unclear on a few things.  Why exactly was the government sniper out there shooting the wolf, did you catch that?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	3	I think I read that too. Its hard to understand that part. Why do you think he was there	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	4	I really am not sure.  Like if he had a valid reason, like maybe the wolves were terrorizing the public or threatening people then I could understand it.  If he was just randomly there shooting wolves for fun that seems uncool.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	5	It seems a lot of people just shoot animals for fun nowadays.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	6	Yeah it does, and a wolf seems like a random thing to want to kill for fun.  You can't even eat the meat.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	7	Thats interesting to learn didn't know wolf meat is something you can't eat. You learn something new everyday.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
316	8	Well maybe you can eat it?  I've never heard of people eating it, though.  Like people where I Live hunt dear for fun and eat the meat.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	39.0	24.0	315.0
316	9	Deer meat seems like it would be tasty to be honest although I've never had it. What do you think about hunting overall?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	39.0	19.0	815.0
317	0	How do you feel about this article?	1.3333	0.3333	0.3333	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	1	It makes me so sad anythign involving animals being killed hits my heart	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	10	Yeah, it's really hard to think about though, because you can also feel for the animals that the wolves are killing. And if they don't kill any of the wolves, they may become even a bigger threat. It seems animals are being hurt either way.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	11	I agree but i guess i like natural process better then the government playing god	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	12	I wonder if people can legally kill them there. It might be better if the government controls it all than putting it in the hands of the ranchers.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	13	yeah i can see that if it was more controlled during a certain period of time	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	14	I feel like when I'm watching a nature show and everything is nice and all the animals are fine and then some predator comes in and tries to catch one of the animals. I understand it has to happen, but I don't want to see it or even think about it.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	15	Exactly on one hand you know it has to happen but on the other you feel that wolf as you or your family and just feel bad for it	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	16	Well hopefully you can forget about this and have a great day!	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	17	yes i totally agree think about positive things!	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	18	Nice talking to you!	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	19	you two thank you!	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	2	Yeah, I agree, especially after the poor guy traveled over 700 miles. He had no idea what he was heading into.	2.0	2.0	3.6667	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	20	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	21	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	3	And he even escaped one killing field so sad	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	4	I wonder why there is a federal program to kill the wolves.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	5	It might be there a danger in those areas to livestock and people	1.3333	0.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	6	Yeah, that makes sense. I still don't even like to think about it.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	7	yeah it brakes my heart he just wanted a new life it seems	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
317	8	He was probably run out of other areas by other wolves claiming the territory. It is so sad, his fears were probably of other male wolves.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	39.0	57.0	316.0
317	9	that is horrible i am glad those groups are fighting for animals like them	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	39.0	53.0	816.0
318	0	What happened to the wolf is so terrible. It makes me sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	1	Yeah. I can't believe it was killed by an actual sniper; that's nuts.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	10	Yeah.. it just seems so cruel. Especially people that take pictures of the animal's body afterwards. So inhumane	2.0	4.3333	4.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	11	The stuffed ones they hang on the walls are the ones I really don't like. It just seems... blegh.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	12	That's just disturbing on so many levels!	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	13	It's biting us, though. Bc of the lower wolf population there's a ton of deer, which means more ticks, which has resulted in a massive spike in lyme disease over the past 20 years. All because we killed the wolves.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	14	I never even thought of it like that but it seems like a big problem. I wonder what people can do to help.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	15	I bet there's some kind of petition or bill people could lobby for. Like through a wildlife conservation?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	16	I might have to look that up later. I think hunting overall should be banned. I don't see the reason for it	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	17	Yeah. Like I said, if you gotta hunt to eat, fine. But death shouldn't be a sport.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	18	Agreed. It was nice talking to you!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	19	It was nice talking to you too! It's funny, I was thinking about the 700 miles thing. It sounds like so much, but humans travel about 70,000 miles in their lifetime. Poor wolf. :(	1.0	3.0	3.0	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	2	I wonder if the sniper will get punished for this.	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	20	:( Let's hope things will improve in the future for animals. Bye	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	21	bye!	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	22	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	3	I don't know; it sounded like it was kind of their job, so probably it'd just be the organization.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	4	I just can't believe people can kill an animal like this and be okay with it.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	5	Especially since it seemed like the wolf wasn't hurting anybody!	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	6	Exactly. The wolf probably has a family waiting for it as well.	2.0	1.6667	3.3333	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	7	Yeah. It's kind of funny; I was just listening to a podcast yesterday about how we actually need more wolves in the US bc we messed up the ecosystem.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
318	8	Oh wow, that's interesting. What do you think of people that hunt for fun?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	39.0	17.0	317.0
318	9	I honestly don't get it, myself. I mean, I understand if you need food or something, but just doing it for fun...	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	39.0	13.0	817.0
319	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	1	I wasn't aware that there were people employed to exterminate wildlife here in the contiguous U.S.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	10	that makes sense, im sure they had a good reason for killing it	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	11	Could be, they could have just been having some fun. The fact is it's hard to be empathetic when thousands of innocent domestic animals are thrown into furnaces every day.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	12	yeah, i feel like the article was trying to make this out to be some great injustice but it missed its mark.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	13	Like so many other articles churned out by the modern news media. I think a significant minority are written by AI these days.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	14	oh absolutely, all generated to get clicks for advertising, even AI generated youtube videos are becoming popular.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	15	Really? I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube. Are they entertaining?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	16	not really, often times using computer generated voice and clips that are somewhat related but mashed together.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	17	Ah, are there any circumstances similar to the one in the article that would excite you emotionally? Endangered animal? Drunken assailant?	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	18	i feel like i've been so desensitized to bad news it's hard to really react to anything anymore, I can't remember the last time Ive seen positive news in the media.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	19	I know the feeling. Thanks for chatting. bye	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	2	neither was i, they seem to be doing a lot too, killing over 3 million wildlife animals in a year	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	20	you too, goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	3	I wonder who they are employed by. Anyway, I feel sorry for the poor wolf.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	4	i wonder what punishment if any would they receive for killing it	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	5	I highly doubt anyone will suffer any consequences, but I would assume a verbal reprimand at most.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	6	yeah, i feel like the article makes it out to be a bigger deal than it really is	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	7	The hyperbole used in the article really doesn't help to curry much sympathy, you're right.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
319	8	i also wonder how close that wolf was to populated areas, maybe it was killed for safety reasons	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	39.0	46.0	318.0
319	9	I know that oil and gas companies will hire exterminators in the far north to keep wild animals away from workers in the wild. I highly doubt it was close to civilization.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	39.0	25.0	818.0
321	0	That is depressing how was this man not a citizen yet. Something is wrong with our laws.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	1	Seriously! I feel like if you lived in the country for a certain amount of years, you should be a citizen	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	10	Agree with you on that this country was once all about fighting for a good cause.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	11	Hopefully our next President can fix this and we continue to be the great country we once was	0.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	12	Yeah I agree on that one!	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	13	If you were the President, what would be your requirements to stay in the country if you can illegally?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	14	work here ten years paying taxes and no big crimes. I understand running a red light isnt a deal killer.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	15	Great points, how do you feel about overpopulation in the USA though with all the illegal immigrants	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	16	well there should be a quota as well to prevent too many people from coming in	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	17	I think we both can agree that the US should go back to how we were regarding immigrants	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	18	yeah there is no other choice in my opinion	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	19	Well i had a great chat with you! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	2	It seems like a joke to be honest hard to believe that there is no law in place to prevent that.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	20	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	3	Yeah it's just terrible that everything he worked for is just taken away from him.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	4	there are far too many stories like this to be honest way too much	2.0	1.6667	3.0	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	5	Yeah, i can't even imagine what the man is going through..	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	6	Actually a few months back I remember reading about a New York man with Diabetes being deported back to the middle east even though he only spoke english and he ended up dying there on the streets with no health care for his diabetes	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	7	Wow, yeah there definitely needs to be a law in place to prevent things like this. I feel like if you've lived in the country for at least 10 years and had a job.. you should be eligible to stay	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
321	8	yeah it was quite depressing i believe there was a video showing him in the middle east crying and begging to be brought back. Unfortunately it never happened. Hopefully the laws change. I understand we cant take in criminals but what about the ones that never committed a crime and have worked and been here forever.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	52.0	19.0	320.0
321	9	Agree 100%. It's crazy what's happening with our country. People use to look to use as the savior but not anymore.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	52.0	17.0	820.0
322	0	what did you think about this situation?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	1	The world is a vampire.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	10	You sound like an intoxicated person to me.  I don't feel much empathy towards him.  He had a rough childhood, but he has had personal responsibility for himself since the age of 18 and he made poor choices.  He could have made sure his papers were correct and up to date.  That was his responsibility.  He chose to break the law, repeatedly.  What do you think about him?	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	11	It's probably difficult for you consider abstract concepts. I apologize. Do you think that he would have been better off if deported at 18 instead of 41?	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	12	Yep, maybe so	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	13	Do you believe his children should be deported as well?	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	14	No	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	15	Why not?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	16	They are legal citizens	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	17	Did you make any assumptions as to what he had been in trouble with the law for?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	18	No, it clearly stated that if you read the article.  Goodbye!	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	19	gotta be lower case, friend bye	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	2	what do you mean?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	3	I mean that from the day you are born until the day that you die the amount of options you have to dictate your own fate shrink substantially.	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	4	I disagree, I think we have many options every day to control our own fate	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	5	We're talking about vastly different periods of time, but you are certainly entitled to your opinion.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	6	Yes I am.  I'm not sure how you think one's options shrink the older they get, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion too.  So what did you think about the man in the article?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	7	Life in modern society is characterized by indoctrination. You are honed as far as your opportunity and ambition to fill a specific role in society will allow and then you are bound to that by the costs of subsistence. There are always exceptions, but this is the reality for most human beings. The man in the article is probably somewhat inured to slings and arrows, but that doesn't make it right to persecute him because of others mistakes.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
322	8	I disagree about indoctrination.  We have the freedom to chose our role in the United States of America, unless perhaps you are speaking of a different culture?  Regardless, that is not at all my reality of that or anyone I know, but perhaps it is yours.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	52.0	24.0	321.0
322	9	I didn't say we weren't free to choose, I said that as we choose our freedom to navigate outside those choices becomes more limited the more choices you make. You're trying to make this political and missing the point entirely. Do you feel any empathy toward the man in the article?	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	52.0	25.0	821.0
323	0	what did you think about the article?	1.3333	0.6667	0.3333	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	1	It's unbelievable. The poor guy hasn't gotten any breaks.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	10	yeah i imagine so. i dont remember if the article said anything about an appeals process or something he could do to get it overturned.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	11	I think in the article they were asking people to call their Congress person and try to get it fixed. Not sure if it's too late for him though.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	12	im sure something would be done if it got enough media attention	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	13	I agree. I doubt that anyone would be against this guy staying in the country. I think it's just a very unfortunate situation.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	14	well you never know, im sure some people would definitely think he should be deported, especially after looking at his criminal history.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	15	Sadly, you are probably right. I just feel so sad for this guy, to think of him as a toddler being sent to America to be adopted with a bright future. And then for nothing to ever go good for him. It's just too sad. He may not have that criminal history if he had been taken in by loving parents.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	16	yeah you're right. and then to be abandoned by the only country he's ever known, leaving behind his pregnant wife and kids. thats just crazy	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	17	These stories are so depressing.	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	18	yeah, i feel like it's almost rare to see some positive news in the media these days	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	19	You're right, I remember when I was younger seeing feel good stories all of the time on the news. Now it all seems to be negative.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	2	i know right? being deported when you spend your whole life in a country is rough	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	20	i mostly just tune it all out now a days. well, thanks for chatting. goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	3	He has just been failed by so many people. It's very sad. And now he has to go live in North Korea? He probably can't even read or speak their language.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	4	i believe he was sent to south korea, but yeah, still doesn't make it any better	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	5	Yeah, I realized that right after I sent it. Either way though, he is being dropped into a completely foreign culture / language.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	6	yeah definitely, its horrible. i mean i get we need an immigration policy, but to deport a guy because he had a few problems with the law when he's been here his whole life is a bit much	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	7	I totally agree, it seems that newer situations like this will be covered by the Child Citizenship Act, but he was already over 18 at that time so he didn't qualify.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
323	8	i wish the article spoke more on his plans once he gets to south korea. like what does he plan to do there.	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	52.0	46.0	322.0
323	9	He probably is hoping to just figure a way to get back to the U.S. to his family.	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	52.0	57.0	822.0
324	0	Boy did that guy get dealt a bad hand in life.	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	1	Yes, such an unfortunate series of events.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	10	And I'm sure the abuse is a large, if not the entire, reason why he got into criminal behavior, which is the real reason he's being deported.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	11	I think in cases like this there should be some consideration given to the totality of circumstances that lead to the criminal activity.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	12	Yes, it sure feels that way.  But the system is probably limited in how much time and energy they can put into each individual case.  They likely don't have the manpower for that.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	13	That may be true but these are people's lives, how can we say that there isnt time to consider their situations?	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	14	I understand, but in a country of 330 million people, sometimes you have to be a number or the whole machine seizes up and ceases to work.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	15	I disagree. When we fail to consider individual citizens as their own unique person rather than a populus as a whole, it creates more problems.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	16	But it's not feasible to do what you're saying.  Every court case would take months.  Do we just let everyone who commits a crime walk the streets freely for decades while we figure out how their mother treated them as a toddler?	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	17	There has to be a middle ground where the system works effectively but still considers the rights of individuals	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	18	Sure, I don't disagree with that.  Anyway, hopefully this guy finds that Korea provides a better life for him than America.  The US sure didn't give him one.  Maybe that's terribly wishful thinking, but there isn't anything else positive about this story.	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	19	You make a good point. I would be interested to know how his life in S Korea is going now. I do hope better than what hes had so far.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	2	I really feel terrible about the described events of his childhood.  To be adopted by people who then abused him.  Just disgusting, infuriating, and completely nonsensical to me.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	20	Yes, it would be a surprise happier ending if it improved.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	21	Goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	3	And then to spend his entire life in America and be deported, what a tragedy.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	4	Yes, for sure.  Amazingly, he seems to be taking it in stride.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	5	I cant imagine being sent back to a country Ive never really lived in. It makes me feel terrible for him.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	6	Yeah, it would be surreal.  I'm glad Congress has worked to correct this issue to some degree so that negligent parents and/or adoption agencies can't deny the adopted child citizenship.	0.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	7	Yes for sure. It is good to see that this may not happen again in the future. Can you imagine how his adoptive family must have felt?	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
324	8	Well I think both his adoptive families abused him; that was most of his problem. The citizenship/deportation issue is one thing, but the thought of abusing little children, particularly an adopted one, is what really makes me sick about this.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	52.0	48.0	323.0
324	9	Of course. It just compounds the tragedy the child has already experienced.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	52.0	43.0	823.0
325	0	what a terrible situation, we let illegals get away with so much and yet an innocent man like this gets his whole life taken away!	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	1	yep reminds me of the vets that served our forces getting deportes back to mexico for a DUI they did in the past. Doesn't change the fact they fought for our country more than the regular American ever  did. We need to stop deporting people that are not deserving of it and only deport the bad illegals like the ones that commit actual crimes.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	10	how terrible-and we call ourselves a democracy, in so many ways we are still a corrupt dictatorship!	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	11	yeah its quite sad how often this happens.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	12	or my neighbor, who was a war vet and 72 could not get his appendix removed because his insurance would not pay for it, so in order to get his operation, he laid himself out on the street corner when it burst and finally an ambulance took him to the hospital and he got it fixed!	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	13	wowww that is crazy! our health care is definitely not the best	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	14	nope, especially if you got something serious going on, good luck! And these morons in the government are pushing medicaid-type of universal care, it's already bad as it is and they want to downgrade it even further. That's because they have never went to a medicaid doctor and do not know what it is!	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	15	so inept these people are one wonders how they were elected	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	16	by incompetent people-like the illegals they let in in order to vote them in!	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	17	illegals do seem to get away with a lot	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	18	"yes, so it's time to stop this and focus on the needs of our own people-even if we look like a ""bad guy"" by not letting them in!"	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	19	yep its that time we take care of all the homeless in the streets that need help first	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	2	absolutely! We deport good people who paid hard-earned tax money to our corrupt government and let illegals stay while paying their rent, health care and schooling	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	20	yes, look at San Francisco, and it's 2019!	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	52.0	26.0	324.0

325	5	this man should be in america not south korea	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
325	6	I agree with you, my heart goes out to his innocent child and wife, the government isn't going to take care of them	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	52.0	26.0	324.0

325	8	yes, I hope he is shown clemency and justice	0.0	1.6667	3.0	1	52.0	26.0	324.0
325	9	this isnt the first of these stories i heard. One guy with a brooklying accent was deported back to his grandparents country. he died on the streets in that country because he couldnt take care of his diabetes there	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	52.0	19.0	824.0
326	0	Wow, that is just crazy.  What did you think	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	1	yeah good thing there was still blood at the scene as evidence	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	10	lol you may be right	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	11	yep that explains all the wars and bad things in the world	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	12	Yeah, an animal like drive of some sort	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	13	yeah its crazy	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	14	yeah definitely not something I will ever understand	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	15	hope something changes soon	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	16	You and me both.  do you have any ideas that might help?	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	17	honestly im at a loss i would say probably stronger consequences ? just being sentenced to life doesnt seem very intimidating for already crazy people	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	18	Yeah I think you are on the right track with that.  Well I hope you have a good day, nice talking to you.  much better than the last person I had to talk  to.  goodbye!	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	19	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	2	Yeah no doubt.  It sounds like justice will be served but it's sad things like this even happen	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	3	yeah wonder what makes people do this	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	4	Yeah seriously!!  Maybe a combination of childhood experiences, poor choices, and some sort of biochemistry.  I do not know.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	5	yeah they have nothing to lose	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	6	yeah that too	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	7	do you think anything can be done to prevent these things	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
326	8	not really.   I'd like to say yes but I think humans habe done horrible things to other humans for all time,  what do you think	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	89.0	24.0	325.0
326	9	i think its the consequences of being evolved from apes. we are related to them at the end of the day	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	89.0	19.0	825.0
327	0	Do you have much empathy for Jeffery or the victim?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	1	i have empathy for anyone who dies a tragic death and for people that are so hurt they have to hurt others	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	10	I wonder if his surrogate father will maintain a relationship with him after all that has happened.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	11	i dont know seems like a hard call	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	12	I can't imagine. He literally gave him an opportunity to live in peace and security and he threw it back at him in such a violent fashion.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	13	yeah but im sure what he went through growing up influenced that who knows what he lived through	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	14	I'm sure there were probably traumatic events, as in any childhood, but being thrust into a life a luxury/copious amounts of alcohol and drugs (based on the article I read) can cause anyone to act erratically.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	15	yeah that is true there is no consequences until this big of it hapens	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	16	And, when you're that far under the influence your reactions to drastic stimulus will be warped. They probably knocked him from the fourth story window on accident, realized that he was badly injured, reasoned that they would have to kill him and cover it up, etc. etc.	1.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	17	yes good point probably had no inabitions drug fueled and got afraid and panicked that poor man died so seneslesly	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	18	It's a shame... Thanks for chatting! goodbye	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	19	you two bye!	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	2	Are there circumstances that wouldn't warrant your empathy?	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	3	im a very emotional person who likes to see these from everyones view it is hard to say	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	4	I consider myself similarly, that's why I was curious. I feel like a lot of information was missing from this story. Most people don't brutally murder, immolate and bury a person because of a refused sexual advance.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	5	yeah i found that odd two wonder what the history was behind it	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	6	It seemed like a pretty high profile case. There wasn't much mentioned about the victim, but I just read that Jeffery got the maximum sentence of 28 years at the end of last year.	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	7	oh wow thats good but wont that mean he get out around 50 that is scary	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
327	8	Right, how do you pick up the pieces after spending the prime of your life in prison?	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	89.0	25.0	326.0
327	9	exactly and how scary he will be in the general population again!	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	89.0	53.0	826.0
329	0	what do you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	1	I thought it was very disturbing and sad. You?	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	10	its really hard to imagine. some people just have no regard for human life. i mean they stabbed him 15 times, partially burned him and tried to bury him i mean what the hell.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	11	Seriously, that definitely sounds like a death penalty to me.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	12	it'll be interesting to see what happens, seeing as how they don't know which one killed the guy, and they havent been charged with murder yet	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	13	True. This also makes me wonder if things like social media adds to the increasing amount of violence in the world today	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	14	i would bet it does, theres even criminals who flaunt their criminal activity on social media for bragging rights, people looking for attention, and the fame of being talked about on the news and such	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	15	It's sickening. It makes me sad to think about how much the world has changed. So many mass shootings and just hate in general.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	16	some believe its a mental health problem, that maybe all these drugs doctors are pumping people up with may have side effects causing this type of behavior	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	17	I didn't think of that but that can definitely be true. When you watch those commercial on television, there's like 3 minutes of just side effects	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	18	yeah its scary to be honest. seems like at least once a month theres another mass shooting, or something going on. it really is a shame	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	19	Let's hope things get better in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	2	same, im so tired of seeing articles about people being killed or other negative content, i feel like the media just wants to make everyone depressed.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	20	i agree, you too, goodbye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	3	It's terrible. It's everywhere. Television.. social media. You just can't escape it.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	4	i dont want to get all conspiracy theorist or anything but it feels like this is being done on purpose to maybe get people to tune out or stop caring altogether	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	5	It's definitely made me numb to any news i see. Even though the article we just read was terrible, it's nothing that we've never seen before	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	6	oh definitely, its just another story, tomorrow will have another murder or something similar, its a shame how desensitized we've become	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	7	Agreed. Do you think the people that burned the body should get life in prison or even the death penalty?	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
329	8	definitely, i could see life in prison, maybe even the death penalty because of how brutal the attack was	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	89.0	46.0	328.0
329	9	I just can't even begin to imagine what goes through these people's heads. Do they have no remorse or emotion?!	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	89.0	17.0	828.0
330	0	hey what are your thoughts on the article	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	1	what a terrible situation overeall for everyone	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	10	The way he was killed and the cover up was gruesome	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	11	Yes i just don't understand. These people hvae no remorse	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	12	and over the dumbest thing its horrible	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	13	I believe that criminals are born that way. What about u	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	14	me two i think that there have been brain scans that show that	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	15	I wonder what my brain scan will show	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	16	hopefully something good haha	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	17	I hope so too. I hope the criminal got what he deserved in the end	0.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	18	Im sure the investigation showed all the bad and he hopefully gets life	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	19	Lets hope so. It was nice talking to you. bye!	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	2	I agree how sad elite isnt excused from terrible things	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	20	you also bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	3	i just cant imagine how you can kill another human	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	4	Same and then go on and live life	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	5	i dont think i can ever do that	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	6	I would have so much guilt and anxiety i would turn myself in	1.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	7	do u think he deserve death sentence	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
330	8	yes i do arm for an arm just evil	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	89.0	53.0	329.0
330	9	thats good i think the same as well. he deserves it	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	89.0	17.0	829.0
331	0	Hello, what did you think of the story?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	1	its sad how long shes been held captive	2.0	2.6667	4.6667	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	10	i have no idea but they obviously dont do a good job	1.6667	2.0	3.6667	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	11	crazy how they probably live in luxury too	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	12	i hope they are able to get her into an elephant sanctuary	0.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	13	and its also crazy that their license gets approved every year to keep her	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	14	yeah there is definitely some corruption going on	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	15	money talks most likely	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	16	yeah definitely. especially sad it is happening here in the US	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	17	yeah you would think this was going on in a 3rd world country but not here	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	18	i did think that until i had read through the text a second time, lol	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	19	yeah its sad when you realize it  will probably never change	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	2	i know :( and the physical toll it's taken on her body	2.0	2.3333	4.0	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	20	i agree. it was nice talking to you today! goodbye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	3	yeah 30 years imagine that	2.0	2.3333	4.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	4	i hope someone is able to rescue her	0.3333	2.0	4.6667	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	5	i hate reading about these things	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	6	me too and they are very common	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	7	yeah way too common	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
331	8	i dont know how she hasnt been taken from her owner yet	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	148.0	7.0	330.0
331	9	who oversees these things is my question	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	148.0	19.0	830.0
332	0	Hello, This article is so sad. I can not believe they allow this animal to be stuck in a cage all day	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	1	I agree, but we keep people in cages all day. Our society is built on the persecution out groups of all species.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	10	This one Nosey, got sent to a elephant sanctuary in Tennessee. In DIsney & Six Flags they are in a massive area and sectioned off by what region of the world they live in, put with animals that wont kill each other, the elepants have their own area which is huge with lots of other elephants	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	11	Yeah, I was thinking more about a sanctuary than a amusement park attraction. That's neat. Do you keep pets?	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	12	People can probably visit the sanctuary as well, I visit an animal sanctuary with my kids sometimes. I have a dog	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	13	Do you have a stance with regard to animal rights? If so, what kind of rights should they be afforded?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	14	I've never really thought about animal rights, how about you	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	15	Well, i think that it's a complex issue when we are considering food supply. Factory farming is an ethical wasteland, and very little is going to be done to improve the circumstances for those poor creatures without significant external pressure. I firmly believe they shouldn't be imprisoned for amusement.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	16	What is Factory Farming?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	17	Industrial livestock production that focuses on maximizing output through use of hormones/pen that restrict full range of motion and minimizing bottom line production costs.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	18	Oh gotcha, yea I don't think people know much about that and those issues are rarely even talked about in the news. People just buy whatever is at the store	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	19	Yep, that's where most affordable meat in the grocery store comes from and in places like texas it is actually illegal to defame beef in any way. Thanks for chatting! bye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	2	Yes, but most of those people did something to deserve that.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	3	That's debatable. There are people the world over her are imprisoned for being raised to believe in a particular religion, or for holding a particular ideology. I'm just attempting to point out that the world at large has little mind for the suffering of those they are not directly involved with. Do you think the elephant could be successfully reintegrated into a more natural habitat after so many years of abuse and neglect?	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	4	Well I am thinking of the united states, not other countries. I have been to safaris where they rescue animals and they integrate fine and have much more room to roam than a small cave	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	5	I suppose anything is better than continued indentured servitude and imprisonment, right?	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	6	Yea for sure	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	7	These safaris are simulated savanna? Here in the U.S.?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
332	8	Have you been to the one in disney world or six flags	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	148.0	50.0	331.0
332	9	No, I went to Disney Land years ago. Do they feature a lot of animals? Do they actually incorporate significant numbers of rescues?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	148.0	25.0	831.0
333	0	hey how are you feeling after reading this article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	1	I feel so bad for the elephant. Reminds me of Dumbo the movie. You?	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	10	i will check it out! i bet it was amazing to do that	0.0	2.6667	2.0	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	11	For sure. I hope there's laws in the future that prevent this from happening.	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	12	well it said there was a law but usda isnt using it i wonder why?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	13	Hmm good question. I wonder if there's any underground illegal activity going on with elephants in the USA	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	14	oh yes like illigal stuff maybe theres corruption within the usda	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	15	Yeah all of this needs to stop. We're going to be sorry if elephants ever go extinct. :(	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	16	that would be so sad there such a great part of nature	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	17	Yup, they're amazing and beautiful creatures. Well it was nice talking to you!	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	18	it really was will this be a negative part of your day? i hope not!	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	19	I will definitely think about it but it would not ruin my day. Thank you for asking! Bye!	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	2	that it what i was thinking! seems so unfair to her	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	20	oh i hope not I hope you can take this and turn it positive	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	21	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	22	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	3	I'm just imagining them taking the poor elephant away from it's family and being forced into entertainment. :(	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	4	yes in chains and a cain by themselves when they are social creatures horrible	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	5	Yeah, elephants are such sweet animals too. They wouldn't hurt a fly	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	6	yes you would think some circuses have banned using them why is this still allowed	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	7	I was actually in Thailand 2 years ago and got to feed and bathe elephants. It's so sad to read this.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
333	8	wow that is amazing i bet this really effected you then, i saw some at a circus they were so sweet	0.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	148.0	53.0	332.0
333	9	yeah, it was a really cool experience. If you ever get the chance, i highly recommend going to Thailand and doing the same!	0.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	148.0	17.0	832.0
334	0	I love elephants, that made me so sad to read.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	1	Me too. I know they are very social.	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	10	Same here. And they charge money for entry on top of it.	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	11	At least the animals are not forced to preform	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	12	Or give rides to people.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	13	With technology zoo should be come outdated because you can learn about any animal at home.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	14	I agree. The internet is a valuable tool used for many of the wrong reasons.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	15	I think sea world was the worst because killer whales are smart like elephants	0.3333	1.6667	3.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	16	Oh my gosh, I know. Zoos make me sad, but Sea World feels like a literal crime. It's a whale. In a pool. Jeez.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	17	do you think there should be laws about keeping animals in isolation?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	18	Probably. The only animals I can think of off the top of my head that don't travel in numbers or aren't social are reptiles.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	19	I agree. I feel most people do not care either way.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	2	They're sweet babies. And I think they're super smart too. I know they are at least very emotionally intelligent.	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	20	Or they do until they lose interest. I think that was our last one. It was great talking to you! On to the next HIT. Good luck and goodbye	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	21	Nice talking with you too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	3	I think they are smart. I have seen a documentary where they visited the bones of an elephant that died a year ago	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	4	Yeah, they visit each other's graves, which is just heartbreaking.	1.3333	3.0	3.6667	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	5	I wonder why they just didn't take the animal instead of cite them that many times.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	6	I have no clue. It's a damn shame there isn't more protection around animals in general, legally speaking.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	7	what do you think about zoos?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
334	8	They make me sad. I know there are very well maintained zoos, but for the most part they just make me sad. It's one thing if the animals are rescues, I think.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	148.0	6.0	333.0
334	9	Me too, I think it is animal prison	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	148.0	30.0	833.0
335	0	So what did you think of this?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	1	It's sad.   USDA had all the violations - more than 200 and did nothing.   Do you go to zoos or circuses?	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	10	oh yeah, I have no desire to do that but I'm sure it would be really interesting and quite an experience.	0.0	1.6667	2.0	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	11	I just know it would be.   If I could do it in conjunction with helping the children there to learn how to read, i would be ecstatic!	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	12	that is very altruistic of you, maybe you could find financing for it?  Do the groups that sponsor it not help with the expenses?	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	13	We have a local church that goes on several mission trips.   It's large enough to help most people.   I haven't been able to find other ways to finance it.   I work with refugee families here in Denver that were relocated to us because of the violence and wars in their regions.   I love all of them so much.	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	14	You sound like a very caring person.  Maybe that church will one day be able to finance a project in Africa.	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	15	I hope so.    Their stories are so sad but they are bright, happy children.   Several from the regions of Africa really brighten up when they share the animals they saw there and how they protected themselves.   It really isn't like we all imagine.	1.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	16	I can imagine it is very different than what we would expect.  That's greaet that you have had that experience	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	17	It changes how you feel and how you live.   For that, I am eternally grateful.	0.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	18	I would think so.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you have a great day and I hope that one day you can accomplish that dream of yours.  Don't stop trying!  bye	0.0	2.3333	2.0	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	19	It was nice speaking to you.   goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	2	No, I do not.  I would feel guilty going to a circus.  I might go to a zoo if it were a nice one.  We have a great one near where I live  What about you?	1.0	3.0	2.0	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	3	We do.   There is a huge one in Denver.   My granddaughters enjoy it - it is a zoo where animals have large spaces and not a little cage.  I have mixed emotions though.   Never a circus - are there any that do not mistreat animals?	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	4	yeah I doubt it.  I would feel guilty paying money to watch animals parade around like that.  I think they are cruel to them.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	5	Agreed.   They are hit and beat and put in small trailers carting them from one city to the next.   It's cruel.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	6	yeah seriously, it's totally inhumane and they have no say so in it.  I think they should shut them all down.  Zoos, if properly maintained, I think can give animals a safe and natural habitat and children can really learn from them.	1.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	7	Agreed.   Nosey had so many medical conditions and no one cared.  All about the money.  (:	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
335	8	yeah that's terrible!  poor girl.  Elephants are intelligent and sensitive too	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	148.0	24.0	334.0
335	9	They seem to be.   I always wanted to go to Africa to see them in their natural habitat but it's a trip I will never be able to afford.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	148.0	8.0	834.0
337	0	Reading about any car wreck is hard, but when there's kids involved... yikes.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	1	I know and that poor kid who was left behind, I can't imagine how she'll feel.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	10	I think everyone will need therapy, honestly. That line about the shoes by the side of the road with candy and blood... ouch.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	11	Disturbing. I wonder how fast the guy who hit them was going if he had just turned. Must've been pretty fast to hit the trailer hard enough to knock people off and kill some of them.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	12	Yeah, there's no way he wasn't speeding. Not a good move, especially on Halloween when you know there's going to be kids around.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	13	Agreed. Likely drinking since it was Halloween but I don't know since the story didn't say. Could've been really dark if it was in a rural area like most of Mississippi. I'm from Alabama and it's not so great to drive there at night.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	14	Yeah, I grew up in a small town and visibility was always bad. My dad told me to always wait three seconds after a light turned green at night just in case.	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	15	Yes, I was taught that too. Seen many semi trucks fly right on through.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	16	For sure. They always act like they own the road >.>	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	17	Yeah. They're bad in Texas, at least on the interstates. I just try to stay out of their way.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	18	Definitely. Not worth it, as evidenced. But anyway, it was nice talking to you, even if the topic was depressing.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	19	It was nice talking to you as well. Have a great day. bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	2	Especially since it sounds like they already lost their dad, just... holy cow.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	20	bye!	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	3	Yeah. She's going to have a rough future. I hope she has a good network of extended family members for support.	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	4	Yeah, for sure. I don't think it said her age but if she was the middle child between 8 and 2 she can't be more than like, 6.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	5	Just a baby. Terrible. I wonder why they were hit. I imagine the driver is going to feel awful for a long time too.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	6	I can't imagine living with that. They must feel just awful.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	7	Yeah and likely in a small town too. Won't be able to stay there long.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
337	8	Agreed. I wonder how the rest of the people in the wreck are handling it — the article said it was like 10 people in the trailer, right?	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	223.0	13.0	336.0
337	9	Yeah. I think another woman and her kid were injured. Probably will be traumatized. The driver of the trailer probably will need some therapy.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	223.0	38.0	836.0
338	0	I'd be willing to bet the driver that hit that trailer was drunk. Halloween? Yeah.	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	1	oh yes he seemed so out of control	2.0	1.0	1.6667	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	10	I've been in a major car accident - no one was hurt, thank god. I don't know how I would have lived with myself if someone had been killed.	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	11	yes i wonder how the man feels and if he will face jail time	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	12	Well the police they quoted didn't actually give any specifics. They didn't even officially say how many people died, did they? It was very vague. Which is fine because privacy in times of mourning is essential.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	13	yeah it was vague just many injured and dead this poor town	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	14	I just was surprised it went from being as detailed as explaining the girls shoes to barely giving any actual information about what had happened.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	15	yeah i agree maybe it was for the privacy reasons like you said had to wait on families to be informed	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	16	Most likely, police are probably still investigating the cause of it, as well.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	17	that is true do not want to ruin anything for the trail or anything	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	18	Yeah, it's got to be hard to be a small town cop and look at that kind of tragedy. It probably doesn't happen often.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	19	yeah i cant imagine arriving to that seen it would scar you	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	2	Well I thought it was pretty vague about what actually happened, but like. You don't hit a trailer and be totally lucid.	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	20	Well this has been very depressing. That was our last turn I think though. so goodbye !	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	21	bye!	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	3	Yeah i agree who knows maybe there was something going on medically but either way ooof	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	4	Yeah, doubt that town's going to love celebrating Halloween for a hot minute. Sounds like a small town. Chunky, Missouri	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	5	yeah so sad im glad that they got grief counselors in there for the kids	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	6	Yeah, those kids are going to have a lot of trauma to work through for a long time.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	7	ugh i feel for that family who lost the mom and kids	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
338	8	Yes, and wild that the husband had died in a car accident earlier in the year I think it was.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	223.0	6.0	337.0
338	9	i know mayve this town needs to reevaluate there driving rules and test	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	223.0	53.0	837.0
339	0	hey what did you think about the article	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	1	It was so sad.   What started as a Halloween adventure turned to fire and tragedy.   It was hard to read.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	10	back before social media and technology took over! there was always something fun to get into socially	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	11	I know.   I hate all this social media.   All people do is have their heads buried in their phones oblivious to the beautiful world around us.	2.0	1.3333	2.0	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	12	I agree I need to go hiking or get in nature and turn my phone off a couple days a week or else i go crazy!	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	13	So agree.   I have pretty much gotten off my phone.   It's addictive and I do not like addictive behaviors.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	14	Me two! I feel so awful for those first responders who saw the scene that would scar me!	1.6667	3.6667	3.3333	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	15	Oh I know - I do not see how first responders deal with all the horrible things happening.  You can't unsee it once you see it.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	16	i agree I would come away such a changed person hard not to bring that home with you	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	17	I know.   I am thankful that all these folks help in tragedies and are there for the families.	0.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	18	well it was nice chatting! bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	19	Nice talking with you goodbye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	2	I agree especially with a family and children involved it was horrific	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	3	I know.  I didn't understand the dad pulling a trailer of kids???	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	4	Yeah I guess just something fun for the holiday? Probably just didnt think about risks	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	5	I guess.  A trailer full of kids (:    They would have been safer if they were just riding in the back of the truck - maybe would have been thrown out?	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	6	yeah but i know around here nieghborhoods are way far apart and a local dad made it fun for the kids by hauling them around like that just for fun	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	7	Oh I get it.  I grew up in a rural community.  One time about 40 of us got into a cattle truck and drove to Kings Island in Cincinnati.  That was back in the day but now that I'm grown I think ooh not a great decision	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
339	8	that sounds so fun haha I always think back to my teenage years and think why and how the things we did back then	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	223.0	53.0	338.0
339	9	I know.   lol   We played board games, sang, acted ridiculous and had a blast.  Once we got there, Dad had a ladder that we all climbed out.  People were astonished :)	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	223.0	8.0	838.0
340	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	1	it was very sad how they lost their lives	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	10	i wonder what energy he would have left after all this	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	11	I know I wouldnt have any	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	223.0	30.0	839.0

340	13	yeah but you have to keep living to honor them	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	14	thats very true	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	15	I lost my brother last year its been very hard but I have to keep living	1.6667	3.0	4.3333	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	16	I'm sorry about your loss. Must be terrible. i feel like my sister is headed that route with all her troubles and ive just been preparing mentally for the day.	1.6667	3.3333	4.3333	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	17	yeah it was different from my dad and grandparents dying. I hope your sister gets herself together	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	18	thanks and yeah when a father dies its a whole different feeling	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	19	It was very nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	2	yeah anytime children are hurt it breaks my heart	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	3	Yeah and so young	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	4	yeah they did not have a chance at living life	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	5	It makes you wonder why certain things happen	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	6	agreed makes you wonder	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	7	I know funeral cost are high and having three at once would be very costly	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
340	8	yeah and now the family is left to deal with that on top of losing them.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	223.0	19.0	339.0
340	9	Yeah, I know the father of the children is very hurt	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	223.0	30.0	839.0
341	0	This story was so very sad and tragic.  It was hard to read.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	1	Yeah it did seem very sad to me.  I was a little confused by all the politics but it was clear a lot of people were really suffering.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	10	No.  They were just traveling with all those kids in a trailer and boom!  The truck rammed into the back of them.   It does say by the skid marks on the road that it was easy to draw a police diagram.	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	11	I guess it would have mentioned if alcohol or drugs were involved or anything like that.  Regardless, it doesn't make it any less sad or tragic.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	12	I am going to what happens in most wrecks.   Too distracted eating, texting, talking on the phone, or fiddling with the radio.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	13	Yeah you are probably right about that.  It is also horrific that they were out trying to have fun on a special night.  And all the kids.  Just heartbreaking.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	14	I know.  The driver of the kids was at fault as well in my opinion.  Why are there kids in a trailer that you are pulling?	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	15	Yep, I must strongly agree with you on that.  I would never put my kids in a trailer or the back of a truck or anywhere but buckled safely into their seats, that seems very reckless.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	16	"Very, very reckless.    Mine are always buckled even when they cry ""I don't want to""  :)"	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	17	Yep, same.  I wonder if the driver of the truck pulling the trailer was also held responsible somehow.  I'm sure they felt terrible.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	18	I would guess that both will have assigned responsibilities.  She would definitely be charged with child endangerment.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	19	I would think so, which is sad but she did put them in danger, sadly.  Well it has been nice speaking with you.  What an odd circumstance here.  Have a great day, goodbye	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	2	Politics?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	20	You too bye.  goodbye.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	3	Yes, in Kenya and South Sudan	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	4	Mine was about children killed on Halloween night by a truck.  How does this happen?	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	5	Wow, that's wild.  Mine was about a government official from South Sudan being deported from Kenya, and a bunch of murder and rapes going on in Kenya.  I have had the Halloween article before so I know what you're talking about, though.  That one was defiitely very hard to read.  Probably the saddest I've ever read on here.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	6	I know.   Husband had died away a bit ago and now two children.   Very tough.  Should we talk about that one in our chat since I have not read yours?  This is crazy.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	7	Yes, that's what I was thinking we could do.  This is definitely bizarre, never had this happen.  Anyhow, yeah the fact that this had happened to that family twice is unthinkable.  What on earth.  So sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
341	8	I know.  I would love to know what happened to the driver of the truck.  It leaves you hanging for sure.	0.6667	2.0	3.0	1	186.0	8.0	340.0
341	9	Yeah, was there any mention of any factors that contributed to the accident?  That's one thing I could not remember.	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	186.0	24.0	840.0
342	0	the kenyans don't want more people in their country	1.6667	1.0	0.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	1	what did you think about kenya deporting that official	1.0	0.6667	1.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	10	african	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	11	and you hate africans?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	12	trust me I know my own people	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	13	You live in America. I doubt you know them	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	14	I came here when I was 22 I lived in the Ivory Coast	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	15	Why do you dislike Africans? I've never been there	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	16	would you like america to become like africa?	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	17	Ive never been or know anything about Africa.	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	18	fair enough do you see african society, economics, and values as something to emulate?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	19	Like I said. I would need to live there or visit to get a grasp on it. I'm not going to base my opinion on the news which is always full of lies and President Cheeto Mctwitter fingers speaking 24/7	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	2	I think it was a good decision	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	20	Presidents are just figure heads to appease the masses and give them the illusion that the sheep have a choice on how things are really being run	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	21	Exactly. Except this one talks like he runs things when he doesn't run anything lol	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	22	I'm gonna tell you a secret I voted for the guy but I vote for presidents on entertainment value so you can't be mad at me and I'm gonna vote for him again but Biden has been quite amusing lately so that might change	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	23	Why waste your time voting. I rather do something else at voting time. Presidents dont run anything anyway. The bankers do.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	24	Yea that is true we are all screwed and yet we all live in this sort of obliviousness	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	25	we live in denial and think our voice is heard when it aint	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	26	thats why I bought a farm with no mortgage	1.3333	0.6667	1.3333	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	27	its been a good talk. bye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	28	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	3	why do you think it was a good decision	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	4	I think kenya should focus on kenyans like all countries should focus on their own	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	5	but they have 1,000 troops in Sudan so they are not focusing on their own	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	6	I know pretty dumb	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	7	and they basically deported that opposition member to his death seeing as he was part of the group trying to remove the government	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
342	8	good one less african	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	186.0	33.0	341.0
342	9	what ethnicity are you	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	186.0	19.0	841.0
344	0	how did you feel about this article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	1	It wasn't a feel-good piece, that's for sure.	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	10	yeah that would sign major red flags to me those poor people I cant imagine how worse things will get for them	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	11	It's interesting we don't hear much about Sudan.  I guess we don't like to talk about things we aren't really willing to intervene in.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	12	yeah i agree no use in worrying people if we arent going to do anything about it	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	13	I just think there's also a lot of hypocrisy though.  We wag our finger at people and talk about human rights and all that, and then do very little in a situation like this.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	14	I agree but i think after hearing even aid workers were raped i would not want to go over and help them	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	15	Right, I certainly wouldn't either.  But if I'm not willing to do anything about something, I get off my high horse about it.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	16	that is a good way to look at it wish there was more we could do	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	17	Yeah, and I admit, these are not simple or easy problems.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	18	no they need planning and a sensitive look at them	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	19	And a lot of resources and manpower, too, I think.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	2	yesi found it a bit confusing but the human suffering aspect was horrible	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	20	well this was fun! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	21	Yes, thanks for chatting.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	3	Yes, the idea of government forces raping and killing civilians and foreign workers is pretty terrible.  To be honest I don't really understand the Sudan situation.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	4	Yes me niether i think they need a strong peace keeper and more vetted governemnt workers with consequences	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	5	Yeah, I feel like the UN often tries to intervene in these situations and doesn't seem to accomplish a whole lot.  But I don't know.  Maybe it would be significantly worse if they weren't there.  But it doesn't seem to be ending.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	6	Yes i agree i hope they reconcile a peace treaty or something to move forward	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	7	I can understand why Kenya is angry.  They're doing a lot to deal with the problem, from peacekeeping to refugees, and they get criticized in the process.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
344	8	yes I agree i think there efforts are helping some but news like the brutal rape is scary	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	186.0	53.0	343.0
344	9	It's interesting that the rebel leaders aren't even in the country.  I'm not sure I'd keep fighting for a cause if the leaders ran away.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	186.0	48.0	843.0
345	0	hey what did you thinkof the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	1	It's sad.   The corruptness and unjustness that goes on there has been going on for hundreds of years.  (:	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	10	Yeah after reading that the aid workers were brutally raped made me rethink that	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	11	That just makes my skin crawl.    It's like some nations are full of nothing but evilness.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	12	I know they have no civilaztion or moral standards it was at the hands of the government its crazy	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	13	Absolutely!   Always a dictatorship and corrupt government.   Only honesty and humanity in leaders was Nelson Mandella.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	14	He was so great I wish there were more of him in the world I remember learning about him in school	0.0	2.3333	2.0	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	15	Amazing man.   I saw a documentary on him once he got out of prison.   It was so moving - no dry eyes here.   Poor Haiti has never had a leader who cared about the people.   Just about palaces and stuff.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	16	Always about the money and corruption needs to be more checks and balances	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	17	Agreed but who does that?   They are either killed, families threatened, etc. if someone does try to do the wrong thing.   I do not know the answer.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	18	Yeah I agree it is all so sad. It was so nice chatting with you. bye	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	19	You too.   goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	2	It is crazy I dont follow much of what happens over there so it was disturbing to read	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	3	Only reason I know some is I help refugee families here that were torn away from their homes.   I tutor the little ones who know little English.	1.0	3.0	2.6667	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	4	Oh that is great you do that for them fullfilling career	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	5	Exposure to tutors is about all they get in learning English because they are 1st generation.  Parents can't help.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	6	Yeah i had some class mates from haiti that were the same way it was so hard because there parents could not really speak with the teachers had to go through the children	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	7	"I teach several from South Sudan.   So many sad stores.   I loved Haiti - I went on a mission trip once.  It was a life changing experience.  You really don't think about ""things"" and the same way of living life anymore."	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
345	8	I have always wanted to go and help out I feel like I take way to much for granted sometimes people have it so much worse	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	186.0	53.0	344.0
345	9	We all do until we make a decision to go and help underdeveloped, tyranical countries.	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	186.0	8.0	844.0
346	0	I do not like the ban. What do you think?	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	1	I support the ban, but I have four children and I've literally had to leave playgrounds before because people were blowing smoke everywhere.  I thought the argument about it setting a bad example was stupid, though.	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	10	vaping is also starting to kill people by messing up their lungs faster then smoking.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	11	Yeah for sure!  I think 8 deaths recorded so far?  The whole thing is blowing up.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	12	I tend to lean on making everything legal, but that is because it personally effects me.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	13	How so?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	14	I have an autoimmune disease and have to take pain pills, over the past few years its been harder and harder to get because of other people abusing them that has nothing to do with me.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	15	Yeah, that's really unfortunate for the people who legitimately need medicines.  Even when I have had surgery, it is practically impossible to get enough medicine after the surgery so I can only imagine how you feel.  So ridiculous.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	16	Yeah, it really sucks. That is why I would never tell another person what to do with their body.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	17	Yeah, I hear your argument for sure.  But there is also the point of respecting children's right not to breathe secondhand smoke.  Let's just say only in areas that are made specifically for kids.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	18	I agree. If what you do effects other people then it should be banned.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	19	Yeah, no doubt.  But I totally get your point about when it only affects yourself, it's your choice. I can get behind that.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	2	I have four children too. Yeah if it effects other people than I support the ban, but if it only hurts smokers then that is on them.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	20	You too! bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	3	I mean I honestly can go either way.  It's not something I'm passionate about or would sit around arguing in favor of.  I just think it's a good idea bc people smoking at playgrounds irritates me.  I hate secondhand smoke.  But whatever, I guess at the end of the day if it bothers you so much you can leave the playground.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	4	I lumps things like this into the pile of the government telling people what to do with their bodies.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	5	yeah, I can see that too.  But children's playgrounds are made for kids.  Like, an adult has no  business smoking there.  Maybe step to the parking lot and smoke?	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	6	I can agree with you on playgrounds	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	7	Yeah, zoos and parks not so much.  It still annoys me for people to smoke there, but that's a public space.  so there's that.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
346	8	I hate the smell of smoke and I think vaping is dumb but its not my body.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	345.0
346	9	No doubt, I'm with you on that.  Vaping I do not want done around me because apparently these things have a way of blowing up in people's faces.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	24.0	845.0
347	0	hello how did you feel about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	1	i think theyre correct in what theyre doing with the smoking what about you	0.3333	1.3333	2.3333	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	10	yeah really addicted probably thats sad so selfish	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	11	yeah that is too selfish	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	12	maybe when it changes theyll get used to it and wont care so much	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	13	yeah theyll have their spots to smoke in	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	14	true i saw it was a choice or something	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	15	hopefully this stops people from wanting to start smoking	0.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	16	yeah would be great for future generations will be so much healthier	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	17	yeah that would be amazing to see	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	18	i am glad as we get older we do more for our future kids and generations	0.0	2.0	2.3333	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	19	yeah ive noticed that too	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	2	i do two i never thought about the impact that has on children people smoking in public	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	20	well this was fun have a great day!	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	21	you too!. bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	22	bye!	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	3	yeah ive always wondered why it was allowed near children	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	4	i think banning it could have a great impact on generations to come	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	5	yeah nothing worse than breathing that in	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	6	true probably better for everyone actually	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	7	yeah its the only solution in my opinion	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
347	8	true cant believe that people are against it	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	113.0	53.0	346.0
347	9	probably just hardcore smokers that depend on smoking to live	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	113.0	19.0	846.0
348	0	What'd you think of the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	1	I had mixed emotions, I guess.  How about you?	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	10	It may not be an apt analogy, but I equate smoking in public to open carry. I'm not comfortable with seeing a person holding a gun on their hip, it makes me nervous for my health and the health of those around me. But, people are allowed to do it and I just keep my distance.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	11	Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm sure that part of my attitude towards smoking is from experience.  I grew up with people smoking in public and around me, so it was never strange.  But people who grew up more recently view it very differently.  Think about how crazy it is to think that, not so insanely long ago, people could smoke on a plane.  It seems like another planet.	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	12	Planes, schools, hospitals... I'm trying to think of another behavior that has been similarly restricted but i'm coming up short.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	13	Yeah, in my lifetime I can't think of any.  When was public drinking outlawed?  That was probably legal at one time.  Times do change.  Drinking and driving wasn't always illegal.  And one of my family's first cars didn't have seatbelts.  And that was legal.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	14	My grandfather had a '57 Chevy that didn't have seatbelts. You can still have open containers in Missouri. Our childhood hasn't disappeared yet.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	15	I wouldn't mind seeing some restrictions on cell phone use.  Civility would spike dramatically if people had to look at real people more often, I think.	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	16	That's actually an idea everyone could profit from. Imagine having to look service workers in the face and appreciate their contribution to society at large.	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	17	Yeah, it's interesting how as a society we're up in arms about one addiction (smoking) while disregarding another one.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	18	Eh, more people profit from cell phone use than smoking. It's been a joy chatting with you. Have a good one! bye	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	19	Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	2	"My emotions could also be considered ""mixed."""	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	3	I guess I'm not all that averse to the notion of limiting children's exposure to second-hand smoke through regulations.  But the explanation for why these people wanted to do it seemed bizarre.  To prevent children from seeing people smoke... I don't agree with that.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	4	As a smoker myself, I felt the need to parley with the author of the article.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	5	How do you feel about the dwindling space and opportunity you have to smoke?  Do you think you should be allowed to smoke anywhere?  I think it's certainly a mixed message we send about smoking.  It's legal.... only we don't want you to do it anywhere.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	6	Frankly, I enjoy the fact that the space is dwindling. Smoking is more than a nicotine fix for me. It also gives me an excuse and an opportunity to get away from other people for a while. The only time it really bothers me is when I've got a flight with connections.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	7	And how about from a more political perspective?  Do you think towns, for example, should have the right to basically tell you you can't smoke anywhere in public?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
348	8	The government dictates a lot of what people can and can't do in public. I'm assuming you don't smoke. Are you bothered by seeing/smelling people smoke in public?	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	113.0	25.0	347.0
348	9	It depends.  That's kind of the point I'm getting to.  You can find precedent to justify banning smoking in public.  You can find precedent to not.  I was just curious what your take is as a smoker.  i'm not a smoker, but in most situations I'm not averse to the idea of people being allowed to smoke.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	113.0	48.0	847.0
350	0	What do you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	1	It really effected me as my father smoked whilei was growing up	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	10	Do you think they should have smoking areas just for people who want to smoke?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	11	Yeah thatmight be good, alot of big business places around us have those areas	0.0	1.6667	2.0	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	12	I really think that they should decriminalize all drugs.	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	13	all drugs really I can see weed but the hard stuff i dont know	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	14	What people do with their own body is their business. Over the counter medicine can kill people too.  I think I'm sensitive to this because I have to take pain meds and I have to jump a million hoops	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	15	Oh yes I agree people have abused even over the counter stuff now ruining the availabilty for everyone	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	16	I think people should be made aware of the risk like vaping and make their own choice as long as they are not harming anybody but their self.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	17	Yeah I can understand that Ideal everyone is entitled to there way of life	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	18	It was very nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	19	you two! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	2	Yeah my mother smoked while I was growing up too.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	3	I think these bans are so great for the future kids	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	4	I like them, but I also do not what people to be told what they can do with their body.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	5	Yeah I can see that but also smoking in public makes others around you not have the choice to breathe in second hand smoke	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	6	Yeah I agree with that.	0.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	7	I think banning smoking in cars with kids is great two you?	0.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
350	8	Yeah anything that protects kids is good to me.	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	113.0	30.0	349.0
350	9	Agreed, I hadn't even thought about zoos such a major kid attraction	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	113.0	53.0	849.0
351	0	cholera is still around	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	1	Yeah, that's kinda crazy to thik about	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	10	exactly while their people suffer in poverty	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	11	Yeah, it seems like there;s always a huge disparity between rich and poor in these corrupt countries	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	12	the haves and the have nots	2.0	1.6667	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	13	yep exactly!  And I don't think much can be done from an outside perspective.  they have to fix their own problems.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	14	Yea we give too much money to these dictators that don't help their own	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	15	Yep, I don't think we should waste our funds on that	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	16	we have our own third world areas just look at chicago and baltimore	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	17	Yeah we do!  WE need to spend our money there, not in other corrupt countries	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	18	I'm surprised we don't get a Cholera outbreak in LA and San Fran with all the homeless	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	19	You are so right.  It could be right around the corner, would not be shocking at all.  well I must go, it has been nice talking to you.  goodbye	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	2	clean drinking water is scarce	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	20	goodbye	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	3	Yeah, that seemed to be the main issue they were highlighting.	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	4	maybe they should invest in wells	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	5	Maybe so, or some sort of better infrastructure to solve the water issue	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	6	I was thinking that they need to spend more money on infrastructure	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	7	Yeah, definitely.  Maybe that would save them money in the long run on money spent on health issues	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
351	8	these countries have so much corruption nothing gets done	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	350.0
351	9	Yeah for sure!  The wealthy elite are probably living in palaces with pristine water.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	116.0	24.0	850.0
353	0	hey what were your thoughts on the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	1	It made me very frustrated on how governments can withhold medical treatment from people.  It's their choice (or should be) whether to accept it or not.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	10	yes, the gates family are great philanthropist i admire i wish there were more. I like how the foundation is empowering women to sell the chlorine tablets to prevent the epidemic	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	11	Agreed.  What I didn't come away with is why the WHO is so difficult to get things passed when it comes to deadly diseases.  It's very antiquated.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	12	yes, there should be a system put in place for these poor countries that suffer natural disasters to prevent these epidemics	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	13	Absolutely should.   What else surprised you in the article?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	14	i like the idea that you shouldnt rely on vaccines but also implement preventatives because it is so hard to fight epidemics once they start	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	15	I just wonder if it has been effective.   The world is past another pandemic of some sort.  It's coming but I do not think CDC or WHO are ready if it happens.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	16	I dont believe so either, and im sure once it happens there will be a medicine shortage and fear mongering on the news	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	17	And society has reached a point where lives would be lost in getting the vaccine or medication.  It would be mass chaos around the world because there are so many more people.	2.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	18	oh i agree and then with travel and that thing i cant imagine	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	19	I have actually been to Haiti on a mission trip.  It has forever changed my life's approach	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	2	exactly and i think dying is way worse then side effects they might have been concerned about	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	20	oh wow that is great of you to do that i know they have been changed since what was it and earthquake or tsunami?	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	21	Of course, Port Au Prince always needs help.  It really makes you tearful.   I went on a mission where there were many illnesses in the mountains.   No stores, little clean water, and bartering for what you needed.   There were so many sick people they lined up at 4:30 in the morning when the sun came up and stayed until sunset.   There was no electricity.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	22	Wow, I wonder if there was more light brought to places like there if there would be more effort to help them. I believe we should help develop third world sick countries to build themselves up	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	23	I believe so.  When there are no bathroom facilities and tarantulas everywhere, most folks say no.   The people there were so gracious.  They have to garden their own food and have a few chickens so food is very scarce; yet, they wanted to prepare a dinner for us.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	24	aw that is nice! im glad there are people like you who go in and try and help and understand not many poeople do.	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	25	They are missing out on a beautiful, giving experience.   I really do not have any other comments on the article I read but we have to keep going.   I always wonder why there aren't more Bill and Melinda Gates in the world.  Everything is centered around me, me, me.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	26	i agree i think he actually gave away most of his fortune to charity	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	27	"Yes.  It was a pleasure chatting with you in regard to the cholera article.  I will now say ""Goodbye"""	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	28	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	3	Exactly.  It gave them a 50-65% to live.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	4	yes, i wish there was more they could do to prepare for epidemics	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	5	I learned that President Polk died from it.   Folks studied New York outbreaks and found it was from one place.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	6	oh wow that is interesting i cant believe 2019 and people are dying from more curable disease	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	7	The article stated late 1800s but I can't remember the year from the article.  I didn't know it was ever in the US	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
353	8	oh wow, maybe because our clean water systems it is not a thing anymore	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	116.0	53.0	352.0
353	9	Exactly.   Folks in 3rd world countries have no clean water anywhere and aren't educated enough to know what to do.   I thought the Bill and Melinda Gates reference was a great testament in how they give back because of their success.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	116.0	8.0	852.0
354	0	what did you think?	1.0	0.6667	0.3333	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	1	Goodness, if Haiti doesn't have one huge catastrophic loss, they move to another (:	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	10	the american indians were good with the land	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	11	They were.  I am white but we actually destroyed a nation of people that lived here first and took everything from them.   It makes me sad.	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	12	what can you do? at least we named a bunch of proffessional sports teams after them go redskins and cleveland indians kansas city chiefs	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	13	well all that is being changed by the PC society.   If I were Native American, I would be proud of that as well.       I know some lovely Haitians that have citizenship.   I don't know what the answer is to get them settled.  Every time money is given, the President takes it and it never gets to the people.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	14	corruption is a universal language	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	15	It started when man was created and has never stopped.  It never will unfortunately.   Greed, power, money.....	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	16	I can dig it just throw some of that blood money my way and I can quit mturk	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	17	lol - I hear you but at least we have something to pay a few bills	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	18	yea I need it	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	19	It was so nice chatting with you today.   Blessings to you and yours.   goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	2	its always somethins	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	20	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	3	It is.   People in the US fighting against vaccines are uneducated in my opinion.   I hope I didn't offend.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	4	No I want to help people in the US with water f	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	5	So many life changing events to think of.   Bill and Melinda Gates have been such a giving couple of what they saved over the years.   I can't imagine not having enough cholera vaccines for all the habitants.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	6	we need to help people in Flint before hatians and bangladeshis	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	7	I believe we need to help everyone and not waste money on useless government positions.   It's not just Flint needing clean water.   Half of Kentucky has unclean water due to destroying water supplies by coal companies.	2.0	1.6667	3.3333	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
354	8	yea and the fracking too	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	116.0	33.0	353.0
354	9	exactly - half of that runs into the primary source.   Reclamation bonds are not high enough.  If it were millions and millions of dollars, they would restore the land but they just walk away and leave a destroyed piece of the earth.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	116.0	8.0	853.0
355	0	what do you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	1	i thought its embarrasing how an agreement can't be reached on whether the vaccines are effective or not	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	10	No I think it will remain the same what about you?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	11	yeah much like all other problems in the world it will most likely stay the same	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	12	I think people only come together when something really bad happens and only for a limit time.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	13	yeah it takes death for people to show emotions for a day or two max	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	14	Then back to business as usually.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	15	yep back to their real self after that	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	16	It sad because life is really so valuable, but people are treated like they are disposable	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	17	money is the root of it	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	18	I agree, it was nice chatting! bye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	2	Yeah, people care more about who is right than doing the right thing.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	3	yeah the egos are through the roof in that article	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	4	A lot people find it hard to get out of the way of their ego.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	5	it explains why many problems in the world are still unsolved	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	6	I also think a lot people lack empathy for people besides their self.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	7	yeah its a me or them mentality	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
355	8	Yeah it sad but true	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	116.0	30.0	354.0
355	9	do you see any signs of this changing in the future?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	116.0	19.0	854.0
356	0	what did you think about the article	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	1	this whole things is horrible and terrifying to me	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	10	imagine being stuck on a plane like that	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	11	and knowing theres a shooter or something wrong i would have an anxiety attack	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	12	i would probably look for a way out but there is no way out of a plane like that	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	13	true i would scream or something no way id stay in quiet	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	14	yeah i would probably try and stay quiet to not attract attention	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	15	i wonder if they will boost up security when entering the airport	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	16	they have to at this point	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	17	true man what a horrible senseless way to die i wonder what was the reasoning he target him	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	18	probably a mental disorder	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	19	or maybe some kind of love thing gone bad?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	2	I agree its quite crazy	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	20	it could be that too	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	21	whatever it was i pray for both families	0.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	22	it was a good talk i enjoyed it. bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	23	thanks bye!	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	3	i cant believe a gunman even got into the airport after 9/11 and security	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	4	goes to show we need better gun laws	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	5	maybe but who knows he could have not gotten the gun legally and if someone else had a gun there maybe they could have shot him down	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	6	yeah there needs to be stronger background checks for these lunatics out there	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	7	yeah i feel so bad for the kids of the victim living without there dad	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
356	8	yeah thats the saddest part	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	44.0	19.0	355.0
356	9	and the people stuck on the plane for hours	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	44.0	53.0	855.0
357	0	Have you ever imagined killing another person?	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	1	No, how about you?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	10	Yeah, these articles are everything but thorough.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	11	How would you feel if your plane was delayed? would you have empathy for the person who died?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	12	Having dealt with delays for much less morbid reasons, yes I believe I would. How about you?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	13	I would, but it made me think about how many lives that one shooting effected.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	14	That's the ticket isn't it? How many people cared about the victim? How will it affect their lives having to deal with the grief of losing a loved one. That's the kind of news that doesn't get reported on.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	15	Yeah, the story is reported is most people get to move on. Like this mass shooting are a talking point for some, but to others its their new reality of living without a loved one.	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	16	Right. It's the body count that people tune in for. The reality of living with it is a one off and much more difficult to report on.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	17	As I get older some stories stick with me more. Like that little girl who was shot in texas. I have a daughter the same age and same name.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	18	Wow. I can understand why something like that would stick. Wish you the best. Thanks for chatting! bye	0.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	19	You too! bye	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	2	I've pictured myself in situations where that might be an eventuality. You've never hypothetically lived as a soldier? You've never imagined having to take a family member off life support?	2.0	2.0	1.0	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	3	No, I never hypothetically lived as a soldier. I have taken a family member off of life support but I do not think of that as killing someone.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	4	We frame things in a certain way to make them easier to live with. Do you think that living in a world ridden with bad news has compromised our ability to sympathize with victims of murder?	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	5	I totally agree with that. I think we put way less value on life than we should.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	6	While reading the article I tried to think of what kind of impetus it would take for me to end another human beings life. I couldn't find one. Is there some kind of stimulus that would drive you to take such drastic action?	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	7	Protect my family is the only thing I can think of.	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
357	8	That's totally reasonable. Did it strike you as odd that this happened in an airport?	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	25.0	356.0
357	9	Yes, I was thinking they were lovers or something. The story really did not give a reason for the shooting.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	44.0	30.0	856.0
358	0	Hi	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	1	hey what did you think about that article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	10	yes for sure	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	11	I cant believe in 2019 somehting like this could happen at an airport	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	12	yes you think someone would have stopped him	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	13	Yeah better secruity maybe new laws need to be put in place	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	14	yes for example look at that woman that keeps sneaking on planes how does she keep doing it	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	15	oh i heard about that that is a huge problem and copy catters will probably try now	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0

358	22	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	3	i just want toknow the motive	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	4	I guess we will never know	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	5	I feel so bad for there kids now	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	6	yes me too	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	7	they need thrapists	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
358	8	that will be forever in their heads	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	44.0	34.0	357.0
358	9	I agree also the people stuck on the plane while this was happening i would freak	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	44.0	53.0	857.0
359	0	what did you think?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	1	Ugh I just think it's so sad every time I hear of some senseless shooting like this.  It's always some lunatic with a gun who's angry at the world or emotionally unstable and takes it out on others.  So insane.  What did you think?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	10	just google it and see if its true and its not the guns other countries have guns too	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	11	http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/  This says the US is actually number 66 on the list of mass shootings per capita	1.6667	0.6667	1.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	12	The truth of the matter is that the United States is actually number sixty-six on the list of countries in terms of mass shooting rates per capita, but they have had more mass shootings than any other country in terms of overall numbers.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	13	Per capita would be the relevant statistic.  But regardless, it is clear that it is a problem in many countries, not just the U.S.  It is a global issue.	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	14	yes it is a global problem but we're number one in overall numbers thank god we need to be number one in everything because we are exceptional	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	15	What did you think of the man in the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	16	typical american guy	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	17	how so?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	18	football	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	19	Well you have a great day, I gotta go.  bye!	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	2	the world is getting worse	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	3	definitely more unstable	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	4	maybe its the culuture	1.6667	0.6667	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	5	what about it do you think?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	6	its a uniquely american problem	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	7	I don't think so, this is happening in many other countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, too.  Sometimes it is knives or machetes instead of guns but the same premise of some lunatic just massacreing other people for no apparent reason	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
359	8	yea but in the first world mass shootings happen way more here then anywhere else I guess since we have to be the best in everything mass shootings should be no different	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	44.0	33.0	358.0
359	9	I'm not sure, I haven't seen any data supporting that but perhaps you have some.  Regardless, it is happening too much anywhere.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	24.0	858.0
360	0	I have a lot more questions than answers after reading that, like how did they even know for sure they had the right suspect	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	1	I was also wondering why this man was targeted? Was he involved in something shady or was he picked randomly by the shooter?	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	10	probably normal reasons for murder, personal grievances etc	1.6667	1.0	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	11	that's exactly what I'm thinking, but they made it sound like the victim was an exemplary husband, father, etc., who was suddenly taken out	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	12	yeah it doesn't add up, I really wonder why they believed the man in question was the real suspect, or if that was just the convenient assumption	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	13	to close the case and spread fake news to the public, regular sources of news cannot be trusted, period, it's like hearing made up fairy tales there's maybe 20% of truth all in all!	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	14	frustrating that there are not really reliable sources of info	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	15	yes, you have really dig on the internet to get to the bottom, we will be shocked 20-25 years from now of what really went on!	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	16	if even, not like they've released much on JFK etc	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	17	very true, some day they will have to re-write the entire history	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	18	maybe by then they will have figured out how to get airport security right	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	19	exactly, instead of X-raying and groping harmless people who want to bring baby food on the plane!	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	2	not a lot of info, maybe they were trying to avoid public panic, or just didn't know much	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	20	yeah it's all security theater, not sure if actual security would even be possible tbh	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	21	Israel has the most secure airports in the world, they got their system down pretty good, US should do the same	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	22	what does Israel do	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	23	I'm not sure, but I know they got everything combed carefully-including their parking, not one person gets passed without a scan or a check	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	24	I think I read something about how they do a lot of face and body language reading, but also probably racial profiling	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	25	that's a good idea, but wait-people will cry like babies and us racists if we start racial profiling, they find everything offensive	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	26	hmm	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	27	society needs to focus more on people and less racism etc. we have greater issues to tackle!	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	28	I am not sure, in this particular case at least I don't know if it would have made a difference	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	29	yes, whatever the reason my heart goes out to the family left behind, he had two kids	0.6667	2.0	3.0	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	3	they never tell public the truth anyway, just like the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, everyone knows that's not what happened, fake news	2.0	1.6667	1.0	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	30	yeah a very tragic situation	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	31	as for the murderer, he was a coward, did his crime and took himself out, very pathetic	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	32	yes, not sure how people can think that's a good idea. Well that's all I have to say, bye	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	33	goodbye and thanks for chatting !	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	4	you would think airports would be more locked down	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	5	yes, very true, however, anyone who is serious about doing something can smuggle one weapon or another and there is no way to stop it-those people are clever and won;t be discovered easily!	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	6	I suppose, it did say he was in a parking garage, you don't have to go through security even for that	1.6667	1.0	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	7	no, anyone can drive up there, he probably had his guns in the car	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
360	8	if it was a terrorist, I think they could probably do more damage without even getting on a plane	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	44.0	52.0	359.0
360	9	that's why it sounds fishy to me-only one man was targeted, why?	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	44.0	26.0	859.0
362	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	1	It was so sad; I can't imagine being 14 and going blind :(	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	10	Didn't know much about that. Were  they once together?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	11	Yes, Pakistan was once part of India and it was split apart in 1947. The concept was to split apart the regions based on religious beliefs but families got split across the border and it has never quite gotten over it.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	12	Ahh. Didn't know about that. Yes splitting countries is never good, sort of like  Korea.	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	13	Or the attempt in Vietnam, yes.	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	14	yeah that usually results in disaster	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	15	Anyway, going back to the article, I thought it was really sad that the girl seemed to have been blinded for no reason — it sounded like she just got caught in the crossfire or something.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	16	She did want to become a doctor so I doubt she would be out causing trouble for no reason.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	17	I wonder if there's any hope of her fulfilling that dream now that she's blind :(	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	18	thats quite depressing	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	19	Senseless violence usually is :(	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	2	yeah those security personnel need to be dealt with for that	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	20	it seems us humans have been violent as far back as the history books say	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	21	We are indeed a species with a large capacity both for senseless violence and reckless kindness.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	22	Agreed on that. It's been a good talk bro. bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	23	bye!	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	3	Especially since the article said they've started using specially designed pellets to make the damage worse!	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	4	woww that is so crazy	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	5	"Hard to say it's ""just crowd control"" or whatever when it says they're designed to cause maximum dispersal w damage."	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	6	Agreed. Also they're designed for hunting animals I believe as well.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	7	Yeah. And humans are not animals. :/	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
362	8	unfortunately those people probably dont think that	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	163.0	19.0	361.0
362	9	More likely they care more about political power and land. Splitting Pakistan and India has been problematic since it first happened :/	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	163.0	13.0	861.0
363	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	1	It was sad.   It seems all these articles are so very sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	10	yeah it might not be a perfect country but much better than those	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	11	Agreed.  One's whole life is just where you were born into - good or bad.   I wonder if this girl will get her eyesight back.	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	12	hope so but it seems tough from what the article says	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	13	Agreed.  I hope she does get to ask someone why.   That was important to her.	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	14	hopefully she finds all the answers she needs	0.0	2.6667	2.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	15	Yes hopefully.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	16	do you think things will change in that country	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	17	I don't.   They  have been fighting for thousands of years.   Some countries will just never be better due to corruption	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	18	yeah corruption seems to always be around	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	19	It was nice chatting with you.   goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	2	yeah can't believe someone would think pellet guns do no harm to shoot them freely like that	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	3	Yes - it makes no sense.   Her mom takes such good care of her.  She covers her face with scarves and is trying so hard for her daughter to be able to see again.	0.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	4	Its a good thing too that she's trying to stay positive and greets every guest coming to see about her health with a smile.	0.6667	3.0	2.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	5	It sure is.  Not sure I could do that.  When the journalists met with her, she showed him all the textbooks.  She wanted to become a doctor.	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	6	Yeah shes a good girl who had a good future	1.0	3.0	2.0	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	7	It seems Kashmir and many other countries live a hard life of war	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
363	8	makes you glad to live in the usa	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	163.0	19.0	362.0
363	9	It sure does.   I am always so grateful of where I was born.   You are where you are born.	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	163.0	8.0	862.0
364	0	what did you think?	1.3333	0.6667	0.6667	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	1	I can't imagine what it would be like to lose my eyesight in an instant as an adult.  Must be very scary now for her.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	10	I doubt it have you seen them I guess if your one in a million over there then there is still a thousand of you	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	11	Yeah.  She also wanted to be a doctor so she's probably a real pain-in-the-ass if you know what I mean.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	12	yep know it all	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	13	Who do you think is at fault for the unrest in Kashmir?  I imagine it's Pakistan.	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	14	their both the same people just because you put them in different countries doesn't change their genetic similarity	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	15	It's definitely a sea of brown, I'll give you that.	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	16	yep it was all India once	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	17	Parts of North America look like India at this point too.	1.6667	1.0	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	18	yea we'll be shades of brown in about a hundred years	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	19	You build a thriving civilization and then hand the keys over to the savages.  I don't get it.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	2	Yea their always fighting in that part of the world	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	20	no civilization in history lasts we are no exception the savages are just a byproduct the real savages are wearing suits and run the financial industry the cancer is from within when we lose our reserve currency status which will be soon just sit back and have some popcorn because the world will burn	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	21	What do you think will replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	22	at this point I'm pretty sure it will be some sort of crypto backed by gold reserves that's why you see China and Russia hording gold right now all the major banks are developing their version of crypto while publicly bashing it they want to get rid of physical cash since there is no transaction history everyone needs to carry the mark of the beast	2.0	1.6667	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	23	Yeah, the only thing is that the rest of the world, particularly China, is so heavily invested in the US dollar.  Can they afford to let it be destroyed?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	24	the chinese and the russians have slowly been moving away from the dollar their doing trade deals in their own currencies especially with oil the death of the petrodollar is happening thats why venezuala iran are so imprtant to go to war with	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	25	I certainly wouldn't mind going to war with Iran.  But our nation doesn't have the temperament for it, and it's why we'll be usurped in the world by China in short order.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	26	Going to war with Iran is inevitable they need it to happen in order to start the whole thing off remember we have not been touched by war we never had missiles rain down on NYC. The new axis will be Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey will turn on us. At the end of it who knows what will come maybe a single world government.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	27	Well, hopefully I'll be dead by then.  That's my hope.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  It's been illuminating.  Have a good day.  bye	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	28	bye	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	3	Yes, Kashmir sees a lot of violence and unrest.  I was curious to know what exactly was going on when she got shot.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	4	probably throwing rocks	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	5	I thought the comment by the father was awful/hilarious.  That it would have been easier for him to deal with it had she been killed.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	6	thats how they think over  there ass backwards	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	7	It certainly seemed a strange sentiment to me.  Admittedly there are a helluva lotta them over there.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
364	8	yea they could use a couple wars might improve the quality of life for the survivors	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	163.0	33.0	363.0
364	9	I wonder how attractive the girl was.  Would be a shame if she were a real looker and is now blind.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	163.0	48.0	863.0
365	0	what do you think about the article?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	1	It was so disheartening I feel for her	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	10	I hope the conflict between the two countries come to an end	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	11	I do two must be so scary to live in a place like that	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	12	I would hate to live everyday in fear.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	13	Me two I think I would try and just escape to somewhere safer especially if I had kids	1.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	14	Yeah but it hard to move from what you know your entire life.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	15	True and people probably dont have the money for it so sad	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	16	The money is the biggest factor.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	17	I agree money drives the world	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	18	people put money over lives	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	19	Sad world we live in, it has been great chatting with you!	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	2	Yeah it very sad. She wanted to be a doctor and now that will never happen.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	20	you too! bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	3	I cant imagine one day your life changes and dreams shattered	1.3333	3.3333	4.0	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	4	I'm happy she wasn't killed	0.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	5	Yeah that is true bright side of it, I think they should change there tactics	0.0	2.6667	3.0	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	6	Yeah, even the bean bags kill people when fired. I do not know what they can use.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	7	That is what I suggest two a bigger missile cant get stuck in eyes	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
365	8	Yeah that could work.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	163.0	30.0	364.0
365	9	Or even tear gas I know alot of police forces use	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	163.0	53.0	864.0
366	0	What did you think of the article? I found myself distracted trying to figure out when it happened (like, what year).	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	1	Well I feel like its depressing that the reporter that tried reporting on this got fired.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	10	I think it mentioned something about the US investigating and the UN having numbers on the people in a food crisis, but nothing concrete about them actually helping, which is unfortunate.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	11	yeah I remember reading that just seems there should be more help	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	12	Agreed. Unfortunately, politics and grudges often take precedence over aid. :/	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	13	Hopefully this changes soon and they get some help	0.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	14	It sounded like Myanmar's government will have to start not denying there's a problem.	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	15	Corrupt government most likely. There has to be some money involved	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	16	There's always money involved and it's rarely a good thing. It's too bad their democracy bid didn't work out.	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	17	do you think they can change things around in that country?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	18	Last I heard, there's a major genocide threat in Myanmar so it doesn't seem like things will be looking up soon, no. :(	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	19	Some countries are just too backwards	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	2	It's never a good sign when reporters are fired/attacked/maligned for doing their jobs, yeah.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	20	"I mean, I would argue it's less about them being ""backwards"" and more about centuries-long rivalries, colonization, and outside negative interference than anything intrinsic to them, but. That's a conversation for another day."	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	21	Agreed. It's been a good talk regardless. bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	22	bye!	0.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	3	Yeah. All for trying to give a voice to the raped women.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	4	Agreed. It was startling how many people the article said were stateless, too—nearly a million, I think it said?	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	5	Yep it said there are about 1 million Rohingya Muslims in Burma who are stateless	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	6	I can't imagine how difficult that would be to manage, plus with the health services being suspended. That's a recipe for disaster :/	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	7	imagine the diseases going around the area its frightening	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
366	8	Especially in the camps the article mentioned; the article said there aren't any doctors at most of clinics.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	80.0	13.0	365.0
366	9	You would think the UN or someone would reach in and help them out	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	80.0	19.0	865.0
368	0	I feel like the article said more about Suu Kyi than what actually precipitated the violence.	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	1	Yeah, I didn't find the article really informative. I thought it was a bit confusing.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	10	I'm inclined to believe that they don't have access to plastic straws or classmates. The Bangladeshi government even removed internet access from the border areas where they are eking out an existence.	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	11	I'm sure they don't. They are barely able to get food. I can't even imagine what it would be like to live there and try to protect my family.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	12	Do you think there is a practical solution to the problems they are facing within Burma?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	13	I think it must be a very complex situation, or else a solution would have been already found.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	14	"Considering the fact that making risotto can be a complex situation, I'm inclined to agree. Do you think the current solution is to just have them die in abject poverty? They've been ""working"" on this for years now."	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	15	They probably don't care if they die. What do you think?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	16	I agree. Knowing what little I do about the situation it seems that they are being blamed for circumstances they have very little control over in order to incite violence against them.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	17	Yeah, I don't really get from the article, like you said, what the reasoning behind all of this is.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	18	Yeah, we definitely would have profited from more thorough source material. Thanks for chatting! Have a good one. bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	19	You too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	2	I can understand why the Rohingya are upset though. Despite being born in living their lives in Burma they are being denied any types of citizenship rights and are constantly the victims of violence.	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	3	I agree, I can't imagine living the life that they are trying to live under those conditions.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	4	Seems like there is an increasing number of Muslim minorities being used as scapegoats and being forcefully relocated these days. I read that the Rohingya that fled to Bangladesh are no being forced back into Burma. The situation with the forced reeducation of Uyghers in China. Seems like there's a lot going on.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	5	Wow, you are really knowledgeable about this. I feel bad I didn't even realize this was going on.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	6	Unfortunately, Donald Trump and articles about climate change get more clicks than anything else here in the states. People (myself included) find it really hard to put themselves into these oppressed people's shoes because the idea of living in a makeshift hovel and being persecuted for your religion is such a foreign concept.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	7	I completely agree with you on that. If people were more aware of how people are living in other parts of the world, they may realize that the United States is actually a great country to be living in at this time.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
368	8	It's so easy to take things for granted when you are comfortable.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	80.0	25.0	367.0
368	9	Yes, exactly. These Rohingya Muslims probably aren't sitting around worried about plastic straws and thinking of ways to shoot up their classmates.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	80.0	57.0	867.0
369	0	they're killing many people in Burma mostly Muslims	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	1	Yes, these types of conflicts seem to be happening all over the place.  I don't fully understand any of them.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	10	survival of the fittest let natural selection take its place	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	11	Yeah, it sort of works that way whether we intend it to or not.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	12	I'm okay with that we need to let some people die off help improve the genome	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	13	Yeah, we spend too much time allowing the bottom 5% of our culture to dictate its direction and policies.  That seems perfectly upside down and stupid to me.	2.0	3.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	14	idiocracy	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	15	For sure.  Let's let some microscopic fraction of the population dictate to the huge majority, inconveniencing them and making everything far less efficient.	2.0	3.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	16	thats the country in a nutshell	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	17	Yeah, and I fear we'll only continue further in that direction.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	18	no civilization lasts forever let nature take its course	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	19	Yeah, that's a good point.  We'll get what we deserve.  Probably nothing too great.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	2	people killing other people tale as old as time	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	20	it was good talking to you goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	21	Yes, nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	3	Indeed.  And there's usually some element of ethnic or religious conflict involved.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	4	yea no one likes muslims	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	5	They definitely seem to be at the center of a lot of these issues.  And the UN is usually on the periphery, complaining a lot.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	6	the UN is useless its there to make people feel better about themselves like their doing something to help	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	7	I agree.  I think the UN is embarrassing and self-righteous and accomplishes nothing.  I also think Burma has a right to run their own country how they like.  As someone in the article said, this is an internal matter, not an international one.  I tend to agree.	2.0	3.3333	1.0	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
369	8	exactly we feel this need to police the world when we can barely take care of our own	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	80.0	33.0	368.0
369	9	I guess I also feel little sympathy for these cultures that have existed for thousands of years and still haven't found a way to exist peacefully.  People get what they deserve, to some degree.  i guess I'm deterministic like that.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	48.0	868.0
370	0	well? what did you think?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	1	So sad I cant even imagine you?	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	10	Even safe in their own home! these people are not safe anywhere	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	11	yup if soldiers could just do what they please that is a dangerous threat so corrupt	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	12	I wonder if the usa will help them	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	13	I feel like because its not a threat to us no one will care	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	14	that is very sad but we also have our own problem	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	15	true we have many problems of our own that need our time and effort	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	16	yes i agree. the world is very corrupt nowaday	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	17	crazy they also treated the aid workers so horribly	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	18	True. Well it was nice to talk to you. bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	80.0	17.0	369.0

370	2	its terrible how can anyone do that	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	3	I dont know how do you trust your governement after that	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	4	it's terrible. i would most likely not anymore, i would feel betrayed	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	5	me two but they probably have nomoney to get away so sad	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	6	That is what causes so much danger and robberies, because people have no money	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	7	exactly houses burned everything detsroyed puts them further in the hole	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
370	8	I hope they have a better life in the future!	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	80.0	17.0	369.0
370	9	Me two i think everyone deserves to atleast feel safe in there country	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	80.0	53.0	869.0
371	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	1	I thought it was very sad that innocent people are dying and getting hurt. You?	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	10	do you think they will do something to stop these attacks	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	11	Probably not. I don't think it's controllable. You?	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	12	Same. I think its just out of control at this point.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	13	The amount of people dying due to war  is terrible to think about.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	14	It feels like its been this way ever since humans have been around.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	15	Yeah, its sad to see that humans haven't evolved for the better	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	16	Yep. But then again we evolved from apes so it sort of makes sense.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	17	lol good point. Wonder if there's a charity we can donate to.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	18	yeah that would be interesting to know	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	19	Well it was nice talking to you. bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	2	yeah I feel like the US needs to do a better job of investigating who it supports before supporting them	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	20	bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	3	Do you think US investigating will be a good thing or will it hurt the US negatively?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	4	it should be good because it would prevent the US from supporting the wrong people.	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	5	Agree. I'm just thinking of the people that died and the families they had to leave behidn. So sad.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	6	yeah imagine dying like that. thats scary	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	7	We should feel grateful that we don't have to go through that here.	0.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
371	8	agreed. We are lucky to live in this country.	0.0	3.0	2.3333	1	367.0	19.0	370.0
371	9	Hopefully something is done to prevent more attacks in that country	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	367.0	17.0	870.0
372	0	I do not think that anything will come from these war crime charges.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	1	Other than more death, unfortunately.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	10	I agree with you. It is confusing on who the real bad guys are.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	11	"Yeah, partially because often time there are no ""bad guys"" in the black and white sense, just long histories of wrong doings on all sides. :/"	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	12	To me, it feels like the UN has no real power.	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	13	It seems like it's all posturing and looking imposing without actually /doing/ something most of the time. But then, if they did have power, we'd probably complain about that.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	14	Do you think we will have another major war in our life time?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	15	You mean like a WWIII kind of deal? I think probably no, if only because weapons are so advanced at this point most countries know if we did, it'd be... all kinds of catastrophic. You?	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	16	I don't know. I think it really depends on when the world starts running out of oil.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	17	That's true. The situation in Saudi Arabia right now with the attack on the oil producers (idk the technical term) has a lot of people antsy.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	18	The whole modern world depends on oil. I know I would be screwed if I could not drive my car or get food from the grocery store.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	19	True, though there are some promising alternatives that could get funded.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	2	Airstrikes should be banned but it will never happen.	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	20	Yeah, but we need to start applying them now instead of later.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	21	Which is hard, because many of the oil companies deliberately drop prices when alternatives are being considered for funding to make people less inclined.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	22	Once we do switch, I think there will be less wars in the middle east.	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	23	That's certainly hard to say. We messed a lot of things up when we decided to divide the countries after WWII.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	24	Yeah, but a lot of it about who controls the oil	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	25	Mm, possibly. Ideological differences make big waves, too.	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	26	Yeah, I always wonder how people would feel if I told them that God promised me their house and just move in and take it.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	27	lol, yeah I don't think that tends to go over well.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	28	Do you have any other thoughts about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	29	I think that about covers it. It was nice talking to you!	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	3	I mean, we managed to ban certain gases after WWI, so I don't think it's completely impossible, but it seems more likely that we might get more distinct rules about when you can use them.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	30	You too! bye	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	31	bye!	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	4	I feel sorry for the people who are just trying to live their life and get hit by an airstrike.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	5	The story about the taxi cab driver was gutting. :(	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	6	I'm guess there are a lot more stories like that one we will never hear.	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	7	"Yeah. It's amazing how hearing statistics like ""4,000 dead"" is sad, but then when you hear just one individual's story it becomes... real, I guess."	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
372	8	Do you think the US should stop backing conflicts like this one?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	367.0	30.0	371.0
372	9	I mean I don't think I'm necessarily qualified/informed enough to make that call. But I do think we get involved far too often because we want something, not because we just want to help.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	367.0	13.0	871.0
373	0	So do you agree with the US involvement in the situation in Yemen or do you think we should let it sort itself out?	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	1	I don't have a problem with us intervening.  It's really a proxy war between Iran and KSA.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	10	yeah definetely, the real shame and real war crime here is that these rebel groups see the civilian populous as nothing more than a shield that they hide behind to make finding peace more difficult. And with ever strike more of the civilians will aid them and see their side of things.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	11	Yes, that's a great point.  I think it's important to remember who started the fighting.  The coalition may not be responding effectively or compassionately, but they wouldn't be fighting at all had it not been the Iranian-backed rebels starting it all.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	12	Definetely but still they have a duty to find a resolution and end to the conflict with as little casualties as possible, it seems like often in conflicts like this people only think of the quickest way to end things and rarely the safest way to.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	13	It will be interesting to see what happens now after that drone strike on Saudi oil facilities.  That's the country's lifeblood.  That's their entire existence.  They can't stand for that.  I wonder how they respond.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	14	That was one of the first thing i thought of when i heard about the strike. That impacts to many pockets too not have a big response. I hope that the US advisors are able to deter any major response there because it really makes me fear for the civilians if they are not able to.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	15	Yes, the response could be severe.  The country already is having financial problems, and that threatens the viability of the monarchy.  So they'll want to strike back hard.  What did it say that taxi driver had?  8 children?  I guess a lot of people in these conflict areas know what it's like to be orphans or lose loved ones.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	16	Yeah eight children, and they are definetely all aware of just how dangerous being in the area is as the driver joked with his family he hoped he was able to return that day. What other option do they have to stay though, leave the country and become refugees. So few countries are willing to accept them.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	17	Yeah, and Yemen is pretty isolated down there.  Can't even recall which countries they border, other than Saudi Arabia, who certainly doesn't want anything to do with them. Also, the region is mostly desert, which makes migration impossible in many directions.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	18	Exactly feels like it is the worst case scenario for the civilians there. Well even though the subject matter was pretty depressing it was nice talking to you. bye	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	19	Yes, nice chatting with you,too.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	2	Yeah i'm a bit on the fence about it myself as i know that the situation in the country will be awful without us but with us there are still innocents being hurt like the taxi driver in the article.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	3	Yes, they certainly have a tough go of it. But I think Saudi Arabia has a right to defend itself.  Their priority should be to their own citizens, not Yemeni citizens.  That's how I feel.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	4	I agree definetely. One thing that i have been wondering though is the location of the sites hits, hospitals etc. it seems like whenever air strikes are involved the collateral gets a bit to high and like resolution in other means should be attempted	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	5	Yeah, it's hard to know what's going on there.  Sometimes I wonder how much of what we hear is just propaganda from either side.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	6	Definetely, feels like the only people who know what is actually going on are the civilians and soldiers or volunteers with their boots on the ground.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	7	I think it's strange what it said about the U.S. decreasing its advisors to the coalition.  The article said that was distance themselves from it.  But if they had problems with how it was operating, I'd think the better tack would be to increase advisors to have more control over how it's run.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
373	8	Yeah that makes sense, maybe the fix they think is that the current advisors are making mistakes in the way they operate and are trying to narrow it down to fewer key people. Or make that information is getting muddied in translation within the coalition and they are harder to control.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	23.0	372.0
373	9	Yes, that could be.  I just hope we can find a better way to fight these conflicts with terrorist and rebel groups.  We struggle with these small groups that are embedded in civilian populations.  And when we try to spare the civiliians it makes the job that much tougher.	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	367.0	48.0	872.0
374	0	What did you think of this?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	1	I think war is a complicated thing.  It's too bad this father of eight died.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	10	It seems like both approaches just make things worse	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	11	Maybe in the short term.  In the long term KSA needs to defend itself.  War has solved problems in the past, whether you want to admit it or not.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	12	I reckon it depends.  SOmetimes it does, sometimes it does not.  It just seems like this one has been going on far too long.  Regardless, it is very sad for all the civilians and innocent victims who have to live in fear every day.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	13	Yeah, it would be very unpleasant to live in such an environment.  We take for granted the relative stability in our society.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	14	That's why it irritates me when people complain about America like it is so bad.  We have it so good here and should be grateful.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	15	I agree.  We could all use a different perspective at times.  If we turned off our TVs and phones and went outside we'd be amazed how pleasant the world seems compared to how we perceive it online.	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	16	Yep, exactly.  It is sad, really.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	17	And the thing is I think people understand that, at least on some level.  But like moths to a flame we seem drawn to things that make us anxious and upset and unhappy.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	18	Yes, it is a mystery really.  I must go, take care.  bye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	19	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	2	yeah, those poor eight children and his wife, too.  I think the whole situation over there is senseless honestly.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	3	It's pretty messy for sure.  I'm not sure what's going to bring it to conclusion.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	4	seems like nothing	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	5	That attack on the Saudi oil production facility recently might change things.  That's a true existential threat to the monarchy and country if their oil production--which is their entire economy--goes down.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	6	I don't know about that, tell me?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	7	There was a recent drone attack on a huge oil facility in KSA that knocked out a huge amount of their production.  Like 50% or something enormous.  At first they said it was a drone strike from Yemen, but then there were accusations it came from Iran itself, or from people inside KSA.  Either way it's backed/supported by Iran, and it's something the Saudi monarchy cannot tolerate if they want to survive, because the stability of their entire country depends on oil production.  So I wonder how they'll respond.  Saving individual Yemeni cab drivers realistically should not be their priority when millions of Saudis existences are at stake.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
374	8	It seems like that would just make the conflict worse, no?  How could it improve things?	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	367.0	24.0	373.0
374	9	How does sitting back and taking incoming from Iranian-backed Yemenis, or Iran itself, improve things?	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	367.0	48.0	873.0
375	0	I can't imagine what it must be like to live in a war torn country, especially one where the ROE seem not to apply.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	1	I agree everyday having to worry about dying i cant imagine	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	10	Yeah, not to mention that terrorist have been hitting international aid envoys, so I'm sure a lot of people are too hungry to flee. The whole thing is just heartbreaking.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	11	it is and the fact that america has some play in hhuman suffering is terrifying were suppose to be leaders	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	12	It's so shameful. We're setting such a terrible example of what to do when one wields great power. We seem to have embraced the power while shirking the responsibility that comes with it.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	13	Yes I think more of the curtain needs to be lifted here for others to see and protest any onvolvement	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	14	The least they could do is report on more international news without resorting to making it partisan.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	15	agreed just get the true facts out these innocent people deserve that	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	16	I agree. Stuff like that just doesn't get clicks like stories about what Trump tweeted today or global warming get.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	17	So true everyone just wants the political drama when theres real life people suffering from our actions	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	18	I wish I didn't feel so helpless about the situation. Well, thanks for chatting. bye	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	19	same here. bye	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	2	How do you feel about the U.S. seemingly downplaying their role in war crimes?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	3	It is horrible any kind of aid to this is a crime no matter how big or small its like a snowball effect	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	4	Right? I think our love affair with Saudi Arabia's petro dollars has been nothing but trouble since the start.	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	5	I agree they should not be given a free pass just because of that they are hurting innocent people	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	6	Yeah, when you start targeting hospital and starving people it's time to take a step back.	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	7	exactly now the hospital is shutdown and have to go hours away for help theres going to be no one left	2.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
375	8	I have heard a lot about refugees from Syria, I wonder where people are fleeing to from Yemen?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	367.0	25.0	374.0
375	9	oh yes true im sure alot are dying trying to flee two	2.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	367.0	53.0	874.0
377	0	Well, this was a particularly awful article to read.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	1	Yes absolutely gut wrenching, I couldnt imagine being that girl	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	10	Yeah, actually i'm more inclined to believe that a person would claim something like this happened to them on TV for money than what is actually being described.	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	11	yeah maybe for people to feel bad for her and her story and make some money off of it i can see that	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	12	Do you have an opinion on Dr. Phil?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	13	He seems like a very direct guy and doesnt seem to do everything to help these people but more for fame and money im really not to much a fan of a doctor exploiting alot of people for money	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	14	I think that's an apt evaluation. What do you think would help people in situations like these the most?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	15	I think they need private counseling without the judgment of the world or audience	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	16	I agree. Well, thanks for chatting	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	17	Ofcourse you have provided a great partner to bounce ideas off of thank you	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	18	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	19	bye!	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	2	The girl or the parents, frankly.	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	3	Yeah, I cant believe they are out of jail how unsafe	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	4	I'm wondering how much hypothetical money it took for these people to behave this way.	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	5	that is what I was wondering, and how they even found out what kind of people were they talking to or were they watching it themselves	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	6	Yeah, there's a lot of lurid details that inspire curiosity but i'd be comfortable never knowing. Do you think her mother was coerced by her father or do you think the money inspired her to willingly participate?	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	7	I think maybe he presented the idea to her, but to do that with your daughter i'd think you'd have to be pretty open to the idea	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
377	8	Especially the lengths she went to to normalize and encourage the behavior. Honestly, my stomach is churning just thinking about some of the details included in the article. Do you think going on network television with her issue has been a positive or negative experience for the victim?	2.0	3.6667	3.0	1	91.0	25.0	376.0
377	9	I bet it was a mix. To help others and find some reasoning for what she went through would be positive but having to tell everyone publicly what she went through must be scary and embarissing	1.6667	2.3333	4.0	2	91.0	53.0	876.0
378	0	Hello	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	1	Hey there, what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	10	Yeah I think they should have got life too. It happened in 1996 so they are already out of prison.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	11	Wow, i wonder if they've ever tried to contact one another	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	12	They had the mother and daughter on the Dr. Phil show together.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	13	I don't think i'd ever be able to forgive my parents if that happened. What about you?	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	14	I would absolutely never forgive them. I would want to kill them or at the very least never see or talk tot them again.	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	15	Wow i wouldn't kill them but i definitely would not want to talk to them!	1.0	3.6667	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	16	Haha yeah I wouldn't actually kill them but I would want to. What do you think about the mother saying that she regrets it and sorry?	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	17	I feel like it's already too late. The damage is done.. i would not accept it at all!	1.6667	3.6667	3.3333	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	18	Yeah I agree. It makes me wonder why she even agreed to see her mother on the show? Maybe she just wanted some answers.	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	19	Yeah probably. Let's hope everything goes well for the daughter in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	2	I thought it was horrifying. What did you think?	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	20	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	3	Same here. I can't believe there are people in this world that are that twisted.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	4	Yea it is crazy that those kind of people exist.  I feel so bad for the girl.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	5	I hope she is getting the support she needs. I don't think she will ever recover from this but i hope she has a good life.	1.0	3.3333	4.0	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	6	Yeah something like that has to stay with you forever.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	7	I wonder what penalty the parents are going to get.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
378	8	In the article it said that they got 20 years for it.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	91.0	20.0	377.0
378	9	I feel like that's too little. They should get life or death penalty. Not only are they pedo, they're involved in incest as well. terrible.	1.3333	4.3333	3.3333	2	91.0	17.0	877.0
379	0	hey thoughts on the article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	1	hi, i thought it was very disturbing and sad. you?	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	10	I dont know I feel like i would never want to	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	11	Yeah, i might want to kill them if i ever see them for what they did	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	12	me two they just ruined your trust and innocence forever i cant imagine	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	13	yeah! and now u have to live with what happened forever	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	14	that and then no family or support how do you navigate the world	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	15	Yeah poor girl. I hope she is ok in the future	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	16	I hope she goes on to do great and shows her parents they didnt ruin her	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	17	I agree. I can't believe there are peopel that are so evil in this world	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	18	Yeah I wonder if they were abused and the cycle just kept going	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	19	Maybe! Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	2	Same it is twisted parents could do this to there own kids	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	20	you two	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	21	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	22	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	3	I don't know how anyone in their right mind can do something like that!	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	4	Right! it is shocking there out of jail	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	5	If they can sexually assault their own child, who knows what else they will do	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	6	yup i pray they dont ever have more kids or come in contact with any	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	7	Exactly. do u think they deserve the death penalty	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
379	8	honestly i think they deserve to be in jail for life, and its less of a tax burden if they were sent to death	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	91.0	53.0	378.0
379	9	I think the same thing. I wonder if the child will ever forgive her parents	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	91.0	17.0	878.0
380	0	Hello what did you think about hte article	1.0	1.0	0.3333	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	1	It was pretty sick	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	10	I hope the child is okay in the future	0.0	2.3333	3.6667	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	11	i hope so but probably some serious mental issues	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	12	definitely. i wonder if she can ever forgive her parents	1.6667	2.3333	3.3333	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	13	that is just so sick to think about	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	14	Yeah i think i would be angry at my parents forever.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	15	I would be too	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	16	Maybe the girl will be able to get over this and become a successful young lady	0.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	17	I hope so I like it when people who suffer make it	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	18	True. Nice talking to you! bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	19	you too bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	2	Definitely. I felt really disgusted after what ir ead	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	3	I can't belive the stuff that is going on	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	4	THe fact that you can sexually assault your own child is twisted	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	5	yea that's like some horror movie stuff	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	6	I hope they get life in prison or the death sentence	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	7	they need to kill people like this they never rehabilitate	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
380	8	I agree. If you can do something like this, who knows what else you are capable of	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	91.0	17.0	379.0
380	9	yea they can do anything to anyone	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	91.0	33.0	879.0
382	0	I would hate to die by fire.	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	1	It sounds terrible. You have to actually feel the fire burning you before you die.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	10	did anybody die?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	11	Nobody died. Everyone was okay thank the lord.	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	12	that is a really good thing.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	13	What do you think you would do if you survived a fire?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	14	I would be a little upset, I would really be thankful for making it out alive. How about you?	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	15	I would be really angry. I might go into depression and my anxiety would be off the roof.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	16	I guess it depends on how much insurance coverage you have on your belongings, but as long as my family makes it out okay, I can buy everything I lost again.	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	17	Youre right. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	18	you too bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	2	Yeah, what are the odds you go to get fuel and the tanker blows up.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	3	It's pretty slim. I feel so bad for the families of the ones that were lost.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	4	Me too, and it sounds like they are going to find more bodies.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	5	I wish there was a way that i could help. I feel so bad	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	6	Yeah, stories like this make you be thankful for being alive.	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	7	I agree. Do you know anyone that's ever been affected by a fire?	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
382	8	No and You?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	23.0	30.0	381.0
382	9	A friend of mine had his house burn down before. We were so young so i don't exactly remember what happened.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	23.0	17.0	881.0
383	0	Pretty awful incident to think about.	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	1	Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	10	Yeah, for sure.  I think I'd be hesitant to buy fuel that way in the future, even if it's incredibly unlikely that something like that happens again.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	11	Absolutely. I would be terrified to ever do that again. And to think how distraught the families of the victims must be.	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	12	"I remember being in DC during the DC sniper campaign.  I remember standing and pumping my gas and thinking, ""I could get shot at any moment now.""  Sort of surreal, but we all have to face dangers and uncertainty every day."	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	13	Events like this really make you ponder your own mortality.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	14	"For sure, and how quickly things can change.  No one could have anticipated that, and I'm sure friends and relatives will ask ""why"" for the rest of their lives."	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	15	There will certainly be lingering questions of why and whether it could have been prevented. Have you experienced any similar tragedies?	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	16	No, nothing close to that.  I've seen some gnarly car accidents, but those you sort of understand as human error and that type of thing.  Something like this is just totally bonkers.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	17	Completely unexpected for sure.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	18	Have you ever visited Africa, or Mozambique in particular?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	19	I have not, but I have family from Africa. How about you?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	2	Sounds incredibly unlucky, too, in that it might have even started with a lightning strike.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	20	Never.  My brother has visited a number of countries though, including Mozambique, which he very much enjoyed.  Anyway, nice chatting with you about a sad subject.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	21	You too. Goodbye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	3	Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel.	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	4	Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there.	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	5	I have to wonder what, if any, safeguards they had in place to prevent such an event, or if its even something that could have been foreseen.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	6	Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's probably pretty loosey-goosey I would think.  A type of lifestyle we don't experience.	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	7	I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
383	8	Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images.	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	1	23.0	48.0	382.0
383	9	Very much so. And i doubt there will be any type of mental health support for the survivors.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	2	23.0	43.0	882.0
384	0	hey what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	1	I would not want to die like that.	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	10	how scary this could hurt so many in the future	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	11	They have to take that risk because they do not have any other option	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	12	yup i think the government needs to step in and protect there people	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	13	that would be nice	0.0	1.3333	2.0	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	14	wonder what will be done	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	15	sadly to say but I do not think anything will change.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	16	probably no money to change things with government	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	17	Maybe they build some central gas stations.	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	18	it was great talking bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	19	you too bey	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	2	Same here they must have been in immense pain	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	21	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	3	Made me think about people who don't have access to a gas station.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	4	yes how unsafe is it that thats the way they get highly flammable gas	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	5	Yeah, I wonder what exactly happened.	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	6	Same here how freaky if it was the lightning	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	7	That would be very freaky	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
384	8	they should have more safety and procedures for them	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	23.0	53.0	383.0
384	9	It is probably very unregulated	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	23.0	30.0	883.0
385	0	Hi, what did you think of this?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	1	It was so sad and horrific.  Your?	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	10	No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	11	That's good - are you a UNC basketball fan?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	12	hahaha no just bc I'm not into sports but my mom and my sister both went there.  are you a fan?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	13	I love any kind of basketball!    I am a KY wildcat fan.   I went to Vegas a couple of years ago and KY placed UNC.   Daggum Roy :)	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	14	nice!  I know nothing about either one but it sounds like it was a fun experience.  Anyhow, I think the article said there were a ton of lives lost, what was it like 19 people or was it more?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	15	It said 19 but they expected to find more charred bodies.   What a terrible way to die - I think it would be horrific	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	16	wouldn't it?  geez yeah, must have been painful and terrifying all in one.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	17	I can't even go there - not sure what is worse - fire or drowning - I think fire would be quicker	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	18	oh yeah, I can't either.  I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	19	Me too - it was nice chatting with you today - goodbye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	2	I agree!  So sad!  and what a random, terrible event.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	20	yeah you too!  have a good one, bye!	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	3	I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it.	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	4	yeah they said either lightning striking or something else	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	5	I live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	6	oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	7	We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
385	8	Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	23.0	24.0	384.0
385	9	I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	23.0	8.0	884.0
386	0	I can't fathom just going about my life like those people and then suddenly everything's upside down.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	1	Yeah, it would be really rough, but what a miracle that everyone survived.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	10	Did the article say where the person who went to the hospital was burned? It was very vague.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	11	It was very vague and short.  I do not remember if it said they were burned or not.  I'm assuming so, would have to be either that or smoke inhalation probably?	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	12	Probably. I took it to mean they were burned because of the other two people having burns but being treated on scene.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	13	yeah I took it the same way.  They definitely did not go into much detail.  Didn't mention the cause of the fire either, did they?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	14	Just that the gas to the whole neighborhood got shut off. At first I thought that meant it was the gas that caused it, but thinking about it - seems like a standard operating procedure when there's a huge fire.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	15	Oh yeah good point, to prevent additional fires.	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	16	Yeah. All it said conclusively was that the investigation was ongoing.	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	17	Yeah, that is so vague.  It was just like a news snippet really	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	18	I don't know if that makes it easier or harder to be empathetic - on the one hand we don't know much. On the other hand, that lets our mind fill in a lot of blanks in ways that may make us feel more sympathetic towards the people involved.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	19	Yeah true that!  It could really go either way.  Well it has been great talking to you, I must go.  hope you have a good day, goodbye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	2	I know! Like, burn injuries have to suck to heal, but they made it.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	20	You too! goodbye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	3	Yes!  It would be absolutely horrible to lost your home and all your possessions, but such a blessing that at least they have each other.  I think only one person was even in the hospital.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	4	Yeah, it said the other two that had injuries were treated on the scene, which is nuts.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	5	Yeah, I gathered the injuries must not have been that bad	0.3333	1.3333	2.6667	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	6	"I mean, it described them as ""serious"" but if they were treated on the scene they must have been serious in severity, small in size or something."	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	7	Yeah good point, that seems contradictory.  But you're right, it must not have been too serious if they just treated them there and let them go.	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
386	8	Meanwhile, I'm reading it and thinking how I'm an infant about burning my tongue or the roof of my mouth, haha.	1.3333	1.0	2.0	1	66.0	6.0	385.0
386	9	Oh yeah, I do not like that either.  I burn myself all the time cooking for some reason.  Burns really hurt, can't imagine having a more serious one.	1.6667	1.3333	2.6667	2	66.0	24.0	885.0
388	0	it was good that no one died in the fire	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	1	Yes but also upsetting that ten were injured	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	10	I hope they find a place to live	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	11	Yes i hope the complex at least sets them up with some temporary housing while they rebuild	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	12	that would be nice but probably not	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	13	And often renters dont carry renters insurance so im not certain they will be reimbursed for their damaged belonginga	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	14	slip through the cracks of society	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	15	True. I hope those who were hospitalized can recover quickly.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	16	yep probably no health insurance to cover it	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	17	Thats a tough situation to be in	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	18	absoulutely at least we're in america and not somalia	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	19	Yes I suppose it could always be worse	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	2	yes the firefighters did a good job	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	20	nice talking to you goodbye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	21	goodbye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	3	Yes geting it under control in about ten minutes is impressive	0.3333	2.0	2.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	4	absoulutely that was proffessional	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	5	They said that the fire was caused by an explosion but they dont know how the explosion happened.	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	6	could be a gas leak?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	7	Perhaps. Gas leaks can be quite scary	2.0	1.6667	2.0	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
388	8	yes big explosions	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	33.0	387.0
388	9	I hope nobodys homes were destroyed in the apartment complex fire.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	66.0	43.0	887.0
389	0	what did you think about the article?	1.3333	0.6667	1.0	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	1	It was sad.   I was just glad to see that only one person was hurt and had to go to the hospital	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	10	yeah what I feel like is that journalist should have been at the scene asking questions to get a good picture of what really happened , they probably dont do it like that anymore though and just get information from other sources	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	11	Just sensationalism - it's why I don't follow the news anymore - it's slanted and full of errors.  It's just all opinions - I don't care what opinion the journalist has - just interview and write it accordingly	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	12	yeah me and you can both be journalists nowadays. dont get me wrong its still tough work but it seems easier than the old days when they had to go out and get the news and not get it from the information from another site. i also dont follow the news anymore its a shame what has happened to media	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	13	"I know - Tom Brokaw was my favorite - he wrote a book titled ""The Greatest Generation"".   t was so well written.   Social Media is the worst thing ever"	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	14	agreed about social media. has brought bad things more so than good. Everyone is just trying to get the most likes or retweets and at the end of the day that gets us nowhere. We have devolved instead of evolved like other species do.	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	15	or bully people all day long.  Little 10 year olds committing suicide - and where are the parents - why does a 10 year old have access to social media - insance	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	16	yeah so many children committing suicide because the kids at school make fun of them online because of the clothes they wear to school, or how their body is shaped. It's crazy	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	17	it's just sad	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	18	reading through the article again it seems that this complex probably lacked a good plan for these types of tragedies	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	19	Agreed - seldom are their exit plans in apartment complexes	1.6667	1.3333	1.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	2	yeah the fact that eight people suffered minor injuries only is amazing	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	20	yeah. it was a good talk by the way. bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	21	Yes it was - have a good day - goodbye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	3	I can't imagine what they feel watching their home and all the contents perish.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	4	imagine the memories of people they no longer have with them like a grandparent being burned away in front of you like that.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	5	I wonder what caused it - no reference of anything in the article	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	6	yeah the article was too short for my liking	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	7	Me too - it was like - here's the fire that destroyed everything - and not much else	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
389	8	yeah seems like I wrote that article and not a professional	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	66.0	19.0	388.0
389	9	Agreed - articles tend to be either so very long and technical I get lost or so short you really do not know what the intent was in the written piece.	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	66.0	8.0	888.0
390	0	what did you think about the article??	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	1	I am grateful no one died	0.0	3.0	2.0	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	10	thats good. do u think they should pay for all the things they ruin	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	11	yes but im sure no one has that kind of money	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	12	 i agree. have you ever been burned before?	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	13	well i use to cook so small minor ones but they freaking hurt	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	14	exactly! I cant even imagine being burned all over my body	1.6667	3.6667	2.0	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	15	me niether i think they need strong pain meds for a while	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	16	i think i would rather just kill myself than the pain of burn	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	17	yeah but maybe they put them in comas or something so they dont have to feel it	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	18	Hopefully! It was nice talking to you. bye	0.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	66.0	17.0	389.0

390	2	me too but it's scary because of someone else's accident	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	3	yes makes me think of my own building it could happen here	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	4	exactly! I would b so mad if my neighbor caused an accident that did me any harm	2.0	4.0	3.0	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	5	yup and then ruined all your stuff	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	6	I agree. I hope these people learn from this stupid mistake.	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	7	me two i feel bad for the property owner who has to rebuild	1.3333	3.3333	3.3333	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
390	8	do u think they should b put in jails	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	66.0	17.0	389.0
390	9	if it was an accident no but on purpose yes	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	66.0	53.0	889.0
392	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	0.3333	0.6667	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	1	is is so sad these people died such a preventative death	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	270.0	53.0	891.0

392	12	Same here! I am also afraid of the dark and i get hungry easily. Those people in the cave must have been suffering.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	13	Yes i couldnt imagine i would have a bunch of anxiety attacks	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	14	I think i would faint or start screaming for no reason	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	15	yup me two and having to go to the bathroom...	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	16	Agreed. I wonder how long it took before the people in the cave died	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	17	that is so sad to think about because it was probably slow and painful	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	18	Let's hope they're fine in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	19	you two! bye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	2	It's terrible because it's something you can't avoid or fight	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	3	but there should be something like osha to protect these workers	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	4	I agree. This reminds me of the case that happened in Thailand with the boys.	1.0	1.3333	2.0	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	5	oh yes but atleast they lived i feel so bad for the victims families	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	6	True. me too. I can't even imagine how hard it is to live on	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	7	yeah me niether must just be always in the back of your mind	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
392	8	Definitely. I can't even begin to think of what the people in the cave were thinking or feeling. THey must have been so scared	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	270.0	17.0	391.0
392	9	yeah i would need to move or have therapy to keep my sanity	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	270.0	53.0	891.0
393	0	Ugh. This was really hard to read :(	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	1	yeah that was terrible to read, what do you think can be done to prevent these accidents?	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	10	Yeah. And then there was this other situation in Mexico where there was an earthquake and it took out a school, and there were no survivors so officials just made up a story about a 12 year old girl being alive to boost morale. :/	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	11	sometimes you have to boost the morale of the workers I guess. I'd probably do the same :(.	0.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	12	Yeah. Sometimes having hope is more important than there actually being one.	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	13	yeah when you have hope you stay sane	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	14	"Yeah. If you ever want to get simultaneously frustrated, heartbroken, and understanding, the fake girl's name was ""Frida Sofia"" and there's plenty of articles on it. But. Anyway."	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	15	Ima have to look that up thats interesting.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	16	Indeed. Going back to the situation in China, it's kind of alarming that there are over 1,000 mining operations that they can shut down for being outdated.	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	17	Also the fact that they overlook maintenance	1.3333	1.0	1.6667	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	18	Yeah. No wonder they're the most dangerous country for mining accidents.	2.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	19	well i think theyre known for lower quality products as well. Judging by this article it seems like their coal mines as well.	2.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	2	From what I understand, a lot of times these things happen because companies are just cutting to many corners involving safety and maintenance. :/	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	20	Things almost always go poorly when you care more about profit than about people.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	21	Money really is the root of all evil	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	22	For sure.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	23	Well its been a good talk I enjoyed it very much! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	24	bye!	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	3	yeah saving money can cause these things to happen	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	4	Natural disasters are always hard, but there's something about hearing that rescuers worked for so long and then just found they were already dead. It's an extra level of heart break.	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	5	Imagine the family members of the victims finding this out	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	6	I guess knowing for sure is better than just living in that question, but still... ouch. :(	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	7	you're right I'd rather know than be up all night worrying	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
393	8	Yeah. This article kinda reminds me of the aftermath of 9/11, when they had rescue dogs looking for people and they couldn’t find anyone, and the dogs got so depressed rescuers started pretending to be lost just so the dogs would have someone to find. :(	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	270.0	13.0	392.0
393	9	wow never heard about that, that really is depressing :(	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	270.0	19.0	892.0
394	0	2815897278	1.0	0.3333	0.3333	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	1	That was such a sad article regarding China miners	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	10	Have you ever experienced the death of a loved one?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	11	I have.   I lost my dad at the age of 40.   He left 3 girls - 17, 15, 12.   My mom died at 76 of alzheimer's.   What about you?	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	12	I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my best friend of 17 years at 22. My parents and grandparents are all still living and healthy.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	13	Your friend was so very young.  I'm sorry.   Enjoy your family every day because you just never know when that day comes.	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	14	We try to get together often. Did the article mention what they were actually mining for?	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	15	It did.  It was coal.  China is the biggest producer of coal as well as consuming it.	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	16	It mentioned that they used ventilation fail safes to keep gas pockets from forming in the mines. Do you know how something like that works?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	17	I don't.   I got to go in one deep coal mine because I made loans to those miners.   The only thing I saw were huge fans and they were vented out of the earth.  I do not know if that is the same thing though.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	18	I wonder what the average age of a Chinese miner is.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	19	Just guessing I would think 18-65.   The State of Administration of Work Safety ordered an investigate of what happened.   I don't understand why they were not inspected more closely.	1.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	2	Yeah, I can't imagine what it must have been like for the families waiting for them to be dug out of what ended up being their tomb.	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	20	Unfortunately, it usually takes tragedies like this for safety and procedure to be altered and followed more closely. Thanks for chatting today. bye	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	21	Goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	3	I live in Colorado but grew up in Kentucky.   So many miners died in Eastern Kentucky.  In comparison, there seems that China was incredibly terrible at giving the miners a safe work space.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	4	"I don't think that mining will ever be considered a ""safe"" profession. Accidents happen."	2.0	1.6667	2.0	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	5	Yes they did.  I just always wondered how painful these accidents to those who just suffocate in the mine waiting on people to get to them.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	6	Slowly asphyxiating would be a horrible way to go, but with 33 people breathing they probably didn't have to wait long/	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	7	Let's hope so.   As you already stated, the families waiting on the miners to be retrieved must be an experience that most never encounter.	1.6667	2.0	4.0	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
394	8	The weight of what little hope they had to see their loved one alive again must have been difficult to bear.	1.6667	2.6667	4.0	1	270.0	8.0	393.0
394	9	All deaths are sad; however, this seems to be more challenging.  It would be an image I would never forget.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	270.0	25.0	893.0
395	0	hey thoughts on this?	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	1	I do not believe anything China says about investigating.   All workers are in unsafe working environments	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	10	wow it is crazy how other places are set up i could not imagine living in a communistic country	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	11	Me either.  It's horrendous.    Why in the 21st century is this still going on?   Millions of people in a state they can never leave	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	12	I agree or everything with north korea amazing we have modern day hitlers yet nothing is done about it	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	13	Absolutely nothing.   Their governments need to be overthrown.   People deserve a chance	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	14	yes just assascinate the leaders	2.0	4.0	1.0	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	15	We did it with Middle East.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	16	true now on to them	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	17	Going back to the article, I would think dying in a mine would be long and slow (:	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	18	yes sosad. it was nice chatting bye	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	19	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	2	same here its all for the money	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	3	It sure is - people die in China all the time - the little statement about the mines etc. completely for the rest of the world to see	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	4	yes they need some kind of osha	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	5	They do - Sometimes I think China is worse than Russia in regard to communism	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	6	i can see it especially when you have an economy like that	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	7	Agreed - all this NBA stuff about China is alarming	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
395	8	oh i havent heard nba stuff?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	270.0	53.0	394.0
395	9	Yes all kinds of drama.   One tweet set it all off.   Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong.    It was all about China's counter-extremism where 2 million are forced into re-education camps.  Insane.	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	270.0	8.0	894.0
397	0	what were your thoughts on the article?	1.3333	1.0	0.6667	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	1	I thought the fact that he faces 14 felony counts only is not enough	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	10	yeah just feel awful for these women	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	11	its tough being a woman	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	12	it is and scary	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	13	do you know anyone that has suffered this	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	14	no thank god its horrible	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	15	i personally dont either	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	16	that is good since it seems so common now a days	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	17	agree society is all sorts of messed up	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	18	this was such a nice chat today!	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	19	agreed. bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	2	me two this man needs some big jail time and to never be let out what a threat to society	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	3	Also reading through the article another woman described to police a similar scenario in 2016 which means he isnt new to this	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	4	yes the fact that the victims did not now eachother tells me this is something that really happened and quite frequently	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	5	yeah i agree with that	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	6	I hope that they help the victims with litigation	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	7	what do you think can be done to prevent these things	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
397	8	thats hard because its so random i thinkmaking it easier for victims to come forward	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	368.0	53.0	396.0
397	9	its definitely a tough task to think of	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	368.0	19.0	896.0
398	0	So this was clearly a sad situation, although I am glad they have caught the guy.  What did you think?	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	1	I hate that he got away with hurting so many women before he was caught :(	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	10	Yeah, he is just trying to politicize the issue	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	11	"Yeah. The only disturbing thing about him being ""only a student/only 20"" or whatever is that he's already managed to assault FIVE women. Bro clearly has no intention of shaping up."	2.0	4.0	2.3333	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	12	No doubt!!!  At such a young age.  And probabloy way more women than that	2.0	3.6667	2.0	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	13	Mmmmmhm. The statistics on assault are horrifying; especially on campuses. Do you have any opinions on what should be done about it?	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	14	I am really not sure.  I guess awareness is a big thing.  What do you think??	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	15	Awareness, better accountability. There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea.	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	16	Oh yeah, I am sure that plays a big role.  These kids are clearly way too young to be drinking, they need better enforcement of the laws	0.6667	3.0	2.0	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	17	Yeah. I think dry campuses are the way to go. Like, if you want to live off campus and drink no one can stop you, but the level of blackout drinking at like frat parties or whatever is a bad idea.	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	18	I strongly agree, and I used to drink a lot.  I quit, but I think it is very harmful, especially for young adults and kids, which these 18 year olds are	0.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	19	Yeah. Your brain's not even fully developed until 25 and when you're chugging 7, 8, 9 beers at 18... Yipes.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	2	yeah no doubt, and probably even more than they know about	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	20	Yeah exactly, frontal lobe is still developing.  That's a pretty critical part of the brain.  Well I must go, it has been good speaking with you.  goodbye	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	21	bye!	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	3	Agreed. I hope he gets a better sentence than that athlete from awhile back >.>	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	4	Yeah the famous athletes always seem to get a free pass.	1.0	3.0	1.6667	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	5	It's ridiculous. Like, they have clear evidence that they did it so it's not like it's up for debate, and then they get like three months or something.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	6	yes seriously  disgusting really	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	7	"Yeah. What did you think of his lawyer's plea at the end of the article? About ""politically correct culture"" swaying opinion of the case?"	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
398	8	I think it's ridiculous, just a diversion tactic.  What did you think	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	368.0	24.0	397.0
398	9	100% agree with you. Everyone's against him because he's been caught, not because of some agenda.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	368.0	13.0	897.0
399	0	This article was very difficult for me to read.  So much of it was horrendous.	2.0	4.3333	2.6667	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	1	I know, I think he is guilty.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	10	It is.  Kansas has been the same way - just excuse it all.   I found it interesting how first the legal team was saying innocent until proven guilty but clammed up when the additional ones came forward.  It then became no comment.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	11	That is why I think he did it, too many coming forward.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	12	He preyed on so many.   Drugs, social media, consensual, non-consensual, etc.  It seemed everyone was a target.	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	13	I'm glad he can't do this to anymore women.	0.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	14	Me too.   I so feel for the victims and what they will carry forever.	1.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	15	Me too, I would not wish that on anybody.	1.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	16	Most of the world is a good place but sometimes I think so may horrendous things you hear about - will it change?	1.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	17	Sadly I do not think it will change.	1.6667	3.3333	1.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	18	People have been killing or hurting each other since the beginning of the time.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	19	It is in some of our nature to do these things.	2.0	1.6667	1.0	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	2	Well me too with all that came forward.  There are few times when someone is accused not to be guilty.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	20	All the complicated genetics.	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	21	I agree. The world is beautiful and scary at the same time.	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	22	Yes it is.   My guess is will be imprisoned for a very long time.  Of course, juries are so undependable - you just never know if they will convict.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	23	I think people should only go to prison when they harm other people	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	24	Me too.   People going to jail because they did something to themselves is ridiculous.  Get them help.   It's why prisons are running over with inmates	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	25	I agree, it was talking chatting with you! bye	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	26	you too goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	3	I agree, but it seemed like he liked doing the same thing to different women.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	4	I have no inkling why men rape women.  There are many who willingly want to do that.  I know people say it's power.  That still makes no sense.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	5	I agree. I can't understand rapist and pedophiles	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	6	I found it odd the article including nothing about what UW-Madison was doing, investigating, policies, etc.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	7	They say college campuses is where most rapes occur.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
399	8	Look at all that went on at Michigan State University and as far as I know nothing has happened.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	368.0	8.0	398.0
399	9	I agree, I think it is worst when athletes are involved because it is pushed under the table.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	368.0	30.0	898.0
401	0	OMG, this was absolutely heartbreaking.  What did you think of it?	2.0	4.6667	4.0	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	1	I thought so too	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	10	Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.  Do you remember how far down it said he was?  WAs it like 400 ft?	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	11	Gah, I can't remember. The only thing I remember that it was only one foot in diameter so that it was too narrow for adults.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	12	That is insane.  I am claustrophobic so just the thought of that induces panic.  That poor boy.	1.6667	4.3333	2.6667	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	13	It said he was three, right? or did it not mention his age? Oh my gosh I can't imagine his little face stop I'm gonna cry	2.0	4.6667	3.3333	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	14	I do not remember seeing his age, but he must have been quite small to fit in a space that small.  Yeah no doubt, it is having the same effect on me.  I have four children and three are just babies, I am about to tear up too.  This is crazy.	1.6667	4.6667	4.3333	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	15	I can almost feel the panic of the parents, like the realization of what had happened and the frantic terror. Oh my gosh, goosebumps.	2.0	4.6667	3.3333	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	16	Yeah seriously, like worst moment of their lives	2.0	4.3333	3.0	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	17	I don't know what else to say! this was so sad, like I just want to send a huge frowny face and I wish I could hug his mom.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	18	Yeah me too.  Probably one of the two worst articles I've read on here.  Well I hope you have a good rest of your day, it's been good talking to you.  goodbye	1.6667	4.0	3.0	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	19	Same here. Good luck with the rest of your day! goodbye	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	2	I mean the horror the boy must have felt, and then the horror of the family, it's just crazy	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	3	I know! like can you imagine turning your back for a second and losing your kid forever? Horrible.	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	4	I can't even imagine, it's unthinkable.  I guess the well was in the yard?  Did it say?	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	5	I think so, I know the boy was helping harvest vegetables. And the fact that they knew where he was and what happened but just couldn't reach him. So sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	6	Yeah, that is just terrible.  And how scared he must have been.	2.0	4.0	3.3333	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	7	His parents must have been so distressed too. I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him?	1.6667	3.6667	2.6667	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
401	8	Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detail	1.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	92.0	24.0	400.0
401	9	No, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground.	1.3333	3.3333	2.3333	2	92.0	6.0	900.0
402	0	You would think that the well on your property would be one of the first places that you looked.	2.0	1.3333	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	1	They did.  He fell while working with his father harvesting vegetables.  He just couldn't get him out due to how small it is.  Then they had to calculate where to stop digging.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	10	I can't imagine. Yeah, when I was a kid we always stayed out until dusk just roaming around the neighborhood. I guess that isn't really a thing anymore.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	11	Exactly!   Played with other kids in other yards etc.   I feel they have missed an important part of being a kid.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	12	Do you think that the risk in modern America of such terrible things happening has actually increased, our anxiety has been exacerbated by the inundation of horrifying news stories or it's a combination of both?	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	13	I do believe the level has increased.  I also think we see it in so many mediums 24/7.  That was not the case prior to the explosive growth of technology options.   Definitely with you on how our anxiety levels are heightened when you hear about it all the time.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	14	Have you ever been a part of a search party?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	15	I have not - have you?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	16	No, but once when I was visiting my great grandfather in Oklahoma my family got involved in a search for a young kid who had gone missing from his home. They found him but unfortunately he was hanging from a tree in a field. Apparently, he had had a fight with his father.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	17	Oh my!   Gave me cold chills reading that statement.   So many kids choosing to end their life.  We had one last year who jumped off a local bridge because of all the bullying on social media.   Parents have to get involved for this to stop.  Just take the account down.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	18	No kidding, that's horrible. Well, thanks for chatting with me today! Hope you have a nice afternoon. bye	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	19	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	2	It obviously wasn't since they had 500 people searching for the boy before they started digging, but ok. How would you feel in the child's shoes? The families?	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	3	I would be terrified if I was that little.   I just can't fathom what the little guy was thinking.   Did he scream - was he badly hurt - was he cold.  It's very disturbing to me being a parent.   I have to push those thoughts away.	2.0	4.6667	4.0	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	4	Yeah, they were a little sparse with the details. Was he killed on impact? Technically, they could have easily lowered food and water to him to keep him alive until he was unearthed. Perhaps he drowned?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	5	I don't know.  They were very sparse with the details.   Maybe that's the point - to see how we fill in the blanks.   I remember a similar case from Texas - they did rescue him though.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	6	It reminds me of that Simpson's episode.. Radio Bart I think it was, but with a much more tragic ending. Are your children similar in age to the child in the story?	2.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	7	No - mine is gone but I do have 2 small grandchildren.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
402	8	Ah, well what are your biggest fears for the children in your family? I'm going to assume it isn't falling down wells.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	92.0	25.0	401.0
402	9	Agreed.   My biggest fear is they can't play outside by themselves for fear of someone driving by and taking them.   You can't let them walk or bike to a park.   Back in the day, that never crossed your mind at all.   They are both little girls so human trafficking is a nightmare to even entertain.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	92.0	8.0	901.0
405	0	Wow, what did you think of this?	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	1	I felt so sad! What about you my friend?	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	10	nothing like this, what about you?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	11	I would say one time i accidentally burned myself on the stove, that's about it	1.3333	0.6667	1.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	12	right, same here.  I've certainly done stupid things but nothing so traumatizing	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	13	That's good. I own a dog and if something were to happen to him, i would be devastated... let alone my own child!	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	14	oh yeah, I have four children and one more on the way, it's my biggest fear in life.  I cant even talk about it.  what kind of dog do you have	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	15	I have a sharpei, i love him to death. Now i understand why my parents use to nag me for being out too late as a teenager!	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	16	yeah I totally get that too now.  I'm an over protective mother but they are e verythiing to me.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	17	Yeah! I hope that boy's family is able to have a decent life moving forward	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	18	I do too.  I'm sure it will be very rough for them, ugh	1.0	3.0	3.0	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	19	It was nice talking to you!! bye	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	2	Me too, it was genuinely heartbreaking.  Can you imagine?	1.6667	4.0	3.6667	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	20	you too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	3	I can't even imagine if i was the parent of the child. I would be in depressio nforever	1.6667	4.0	3.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	4	Me too, I could never recover.  It must have been so scary too for the boy.	1.3333	4.0	3.3333	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	5	Yeah i think it said that he fell in while helping his family harvest vegetables. So sad..	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	6	Yeah just doing an everyday mundane task.  Four days is a long time, too!!	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	7	Exactly! But accidents happen, what can you do	0.6667	1.6667	2.3333	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
405	8	Yes that is a sad fact of life	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	92.0	24.0	404.0
405	9	Have you ever gotten into any life threatening dangers?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	92.0	17.0	904.0
407	0	hey what were your takeaways with this article?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	1	I have a hard time with pay comparisons by gender. I'm not denying that women on average probably make less, I'm just not sure it's a fair comparison.	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	10	yeah very true the interest is usually why back when they were created it was divided im sure not much is stopping them from getting into a non traditional role	0.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	11	I'm sure worldwide, that there are places where women are discriminated against horribly. I can't imagine living in a place like that.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	12	true i know places like china and syria they are seen as less than	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	13	I felt like the article was trying to say how bad the US is though that they have moved down in gender pay equality. I feel like if people really looked at how other cultures are, they would appreciate how good we really have it in the US.	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	14	true but im sure thats why the list is created places like africa look at ways we are above them and then us how places lie europe are above us to find ways to improve	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	15	Yeah, I guess it gives every country something to strive for.	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	16	yeah hopefully more improvements to come for future generations	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	17	Yes, definitely. It's been good chatting with you.	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	18	you two bye!	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	2	Yeah I have a mixedreaction it is sad less are in the work system as a whole	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	3	It's not necessarily sad. My husband and I chose for me to be a stay at home mom and for him to work. That is what works for our family. I think we are lucky to be able to have one of us stay home.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	4	I guess, if that works happy there are thing like the stem program	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	5	I really don't get what they say about that either, because while I was working, I had a job in science in genetics. At my work and at most of the other universities that we worked with, it seemed to be at least 50/50 men to women and I actually think more women.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	6	I don't now I don't have much experience with it but I know in college there were alot less females vs males in my science and math classes	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	7	I think possibly there are more men who are engineers, but I think it's just not a career choice that many women make. If a women does get an engineering degree, she will probably have an easy time getting a job because there are so few women engineers and companies are always trying to add diversity.	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
407	8	that is a great way to consider it maybe in the next generation there will be more and the next complaint is to many women in the field	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	331.0	53.0	406.0
407	9	I just feel like sometimes men and women don't have to have equal representation in jobs. If a woman or a man wants to do a job that is traditionally only done by the other sex, I think they have every right to pursue that and shouldn't be discriminated against. But there are some jobs that most women or most men wouldn't be interested in. Like, I've never seen a female trash person. Most women just wouldn't be interested in that job.	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	331.0	57.0	906.0
408	0	How do you feel about gender equality in the U.S.?	1.0	0.6667	1.0	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	1	I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you?	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	10	Thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're supposed to be a bastion of freedom and equality but most of western Europe and some of the more progressive Asian nations have been outpacing us with regard to gender equality for some time.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	11	Exactly and the same with education - Our society is based on me, me, me.  It	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	12	It's true, our public education system has become a national embarrassment in most places. I haven't been inside one in years and frankly i'm afraid of what they look like on the inside these days.	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	13	I apologize for hitting the return key too quickly.   My daughter ended up changing my granddaughters to Montessori.   There kids actually learn, experience, have one on one help and concentrate not only on studies but encouraging them to be great human beings.  Public schools now are full of bullies and teaching to a test.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	14	"They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a ""gifted"" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools."	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	15	"It does.  My daughter was in gifted.  We called it the ""little yellow schoolhouse"" because it was a building separate from the school.   What an experience and jumpstart both of you had in pursuing goals and futures."	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	16	It was an enriching experience to be sure, but having everything come so easily early on made learning healthy study skills and habits a trial to learn once I started college. I was glad to read that the U.S. is improving with regard to educational equality..	0.3333	3.0	1.3333	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	17	Me too.   I am proud of this country and like to see us at least be in the top 10.    Are there other pay equality issues you want to comment on?	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	18	Just that news like this will inspire people to speak up and act on their own pride and in their own best interest. Thanks so much for chatting today! bye	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	19	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	2	I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.	1.3333	3.0	3.0	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	3	It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	4	Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	5	Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	6	"Also, it's partly being locked into the ""just world"" fallacy. Lots of people believe that people are paid more simply because they work harder or are more effective."	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	7	Wow you hit the nail on the head.    Was your mom paid fairly or given the opportunity to advance - gender set aside?	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
408	8	"No, she worked for the state and was offered ""promotions"" but her pay grade was the same and the workload was heavier. She now works for a non-profit and is the music leader at her church which she gets paid for. She seems much happier."	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	331.0	25.0	407.0
408	9	"Oh I am so happy for her!    You raised two great children and now doing something she loves.  US being so low on the pay inequality is astounding.  We are ""suppose"" to be the best."	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	331.0	8.0	907.0
410	0	It saddens me to see the US at 45th below African nations	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	1	yea but its okay	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	10	No - what the article actually referenced.  You can't	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	11	I just did what else do you want to discuss?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	12	It was a full length article about other things - you can't name it - you didn't read it	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	13	well that's not for you to decide my assertion is that women deserve less pay	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	14	It is for me to decide because this is the purpose of the survey - not just spouting ignorance that doesn't pertain to the gest of the article	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	15	no its empathic conversation I can give my opinion on how I feel what are you some sort of fascist communist	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	16	no but you are in the ignorance in how you relate to the people.   All your statements are sexist, ignorant and most likely have no job.   The content of the article is not referenced by you.  Only thing you say continually is women shouldn't get to pay with ridiculous comments.   Everyone has an opinion but is yours supported by anything other than ignorant comments?  so far know.	2.0	4.3333	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	17	what is your synopsis of the article since only your opinion matters. It may be ridiculous but that is an opinion and you can't silence it no matter how hard you want to be able to censor people who have a differing view	2.0	2.6667	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	18	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	2	It's not okay for women to not get paid equally.  Disagree	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	3	why not? they are weaker	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	4	No they aren't	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	5	women have always been weaker physically in general and thus they had to use their wit to get everything they need to manipulate in order to achieve	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	6	You didn't even read the article.  Name on sentence you read	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	7	it was about inequality in pay for women compared to men	1.6667	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
410	8	I told you that with my first statement - expand	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	331.0	8.0	409.0
410	9	expand on what? how women deserve less pay?	1.6667	1.0	1.0	2	331.0	33.0	909.0
411	0	I hate how we treat the environment	2.0	2.0	2.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	1	It's terrible. All those poor wildlife in the waters..	2.0	2.0	3.3333	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	10	I agree. I think human greed is a huge problem.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	11	I wish i could donate or help the animals somehow.	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	12	There are plenty of charities out there to donate to like the WWF	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	13	I should definitely do that. Do you donate?	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	14	Yes, but I mainly donate to human causes.	0.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	15	That's still good. I remember seeing a picture of a duck with some plastic stuck to it's head, it was so sad.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	16	Or the turtles with straws in their noses.	1.6667	1.0	2.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	17	That sounds even worse. I am going to volunteer to clean up a beach one day.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	18	That cools, I may do that also.	0.3333	1.0	1.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	19	Great! It was nice talking to you. bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	2	Yeah, but I know I'm part of the problem because I drive my car just like everybody else	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	20	you too bye	0.6667	1.0	1.0	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	3	Same here. I never recycle so i am definiteliy part of the issue as well. We need to do better!	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	4	I agree. I feel sorry for the generations that will have to clean this mess up.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	5	How long do you think it will take until we can actula feel the damages?	1.6667	1.0	1.0	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	6	I think we are starting to feel them now with the mega storms	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	7	You're right. We recently had a huge thunderstorm and it was bigger than anything i've ever seen!	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
411	8	I fear things are only going to get worst.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	112.0	30.0	410.0
411	9	It sucks that animals and wildlife have to suffer because of us.	2.0	1.6667	3.0	2	112.0	17.0	910.0
413	0	How much longer do you think the ocean can keep taking one for the team?	1.6667	0.6667	1.0	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	1	Exactly what I was thinking, there is already so much trash in the ocean and this just adds to it	1.3333	1.0	1.0	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	10	We can't move away from oil and gas soon enough. We're going to continue drawing it up until it's completely gone, but it would be nice to get to a place where we don't need it anymore to function.	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	11	Yes that would be nice, I worry about what the world will be like for my childrens, children if we don't become more green and start taking better care of the planet	0.0	2.0	3.0	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	12	I feel like the wheels are already in motion. I'm not trying to unfairly minimize the nobility of working toward a low energy future; because eventually people will have to, but the engine has too much inertia to be stopped now.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	13	Yeah, which is a good thing, its necessary at this point	0.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	14	Our children's future will be marked by mass climate migrations, scarcity of water and legendary wildfires unfortunately, regardless of how we behave today.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	15	Yea and I don't think we can prevent some areas from going underwater at this point	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	16	And developers keep building in places that will literally be under water in a decade!	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	17	Yea its wild, people are raising their houses in my area and the water its a few inches from the top of their dock, its silly	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	18	Ridiculous. Well, thanks for chatting today. bye	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	2	Not to mention Japan dumping the nuclear waste from Fukushima into the Pacific recently.	1.6667	1.0	1.0	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	3	Are you kidding me? That's so disturbing, I lived in Fort Lauderdale at the time of the oil spill and I just remember seeing it floating at the top of the water and nobody was doing anything about it	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	4	"We've literally turned the ocean into the worlds largest dump. Every time something like this happens we collectively shrug our shoulders and go ""Oops!"" then forget about it until the next horrible thing happens. I mean, what can you do?"	2.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	5	Yea exactly, there's no regulations to stop this stuff from happening. The owner of the tug boat in the article apologized and that was it	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	6	Do you think there are practical steps that governments could take against this (and other) types of oil incidents?	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	7	For the oil spill that happened 10 years ago i think they might require that whoever has the pipe in the water create a 2nd one so that the oil spill can be fixed in 3 days instead of 3 months.... but for the tug boat incident IDK what could be prevented other than using a different fuel than diesel	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
413	8	I think it should absolutely be required that fail safes be in place before they begin drilling. I mean, it's not like these oil drilling outfits are strapped for cash or anything.	1.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	25.0	412.0
413	9	yea its crazy that these fail safes aren't in place already, I mean that oil spill didn't even put BP out of business	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	112.0	50.0	912.0
414	0	That was a lot of diesel to dump into the ocean.	2.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	1	i agree, what a waste and a danger to the wildlife	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	10	Yeah, that's an interesting question.  I really don't know.  That was a huge amount of diesel be carried by that tugboat though.	1.3333	1.0	1.0	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	11	definitely. best case is the marine life is saved and the fuel is saved too, lol	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	12	I know my dad loves pickled herring.  Hopefully this doesn't increase the price.  Not sure how much commercial fishing is done up there.	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	13	i'm not sure either, never been much of a seafood fan myself	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	14	I also wonder how much of the Indians' diet is from seafood.  Might be a meaningful amount, although they also probably get a lot of stuff flown or shipped in as well.	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	15	i really dont know. hopefully it isnt a lingering problem in the area	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	16	Yeah, that would be absolutely terrible.  I'll be thinking about this one for a while.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	17	i had not heard of it until this	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	18	Yeah, well it's not the type of issue that makes big headlines, and it's in a remote area.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	19	yeah that makes sense. nice talking to you! goodbye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	2	Yes, the herring and abalone in the area sound like they're in trouble.	2.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	20	Yes, nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	3	i agree. i can imagine it would be difficult to clean up	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	4	Yes, I thought it was unfair to criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they were doing their best.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	5	i agree, they are not to blame	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	6	That's the NDP government for you though	1.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	7	i'm not too familiar with how things work up there	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
414	8	Either way, it sounds like conditions were very difficult for the cleanup.  And that's a pretty remote area.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	112.0	48.0	413.0
414	9	i wonder if they are still able to use the gas after they remove it fromthe water	1.0	1.0	1.3333	2	112.0	7.0	913.0
415	0	7924832535	1.0	0.3333	1.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	1	I feel terrible for these poor creatures	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	10	Wow! This is a fact i didn't know. Would you accept a tax or fine for people that litter and dont recycle?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	11	I would do it for littering	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	12	Same here. Maybe we will try to do more in the future. Most if not all countries in Asia are going green!	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	13	all but China-the trash can and the worst offender! They poison everything around. Not to mention the mercury in the ocean and radiation from Japan that reached the coast of California	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	14	True. The whole world is responsible and i hope we can realize that!	1.3333	3.3333	1.3333	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	15	Yes, but some nations are still living in dark ages-take India, they defecate into their own rivers and wash their cothes right there at the same time	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	16	Hmm what do you think Americans can do to help then	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	17	pretty much nothing-that's their culture and way of life, they are poor and uneducated, we cannot help everybody, look where it got us-our economy and everything in the toilet, we cannot be the savior and have to focus on our own needs	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	18	Hopefully we can do something so we can stop the extinction of these animals!	0.3333	3.0	1.3333	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	19	yes, and hopefully this cleanup mission will be fast and effective	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	2	I feel so bad and guilty at the same time because of humans.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	20	Yup! It was nice talking to you. bye	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	21	thank you same here, goodbye!	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	3	God entrusted humans to take care of them, however, humans tend to be very destructive!	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	4	I agree! Humans are causing lots of animals deaths with plastic, pollution, just everything	1.3333	3.3333	3.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	5	yes, it's unavoidable, a lot of selfish people in the world	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	6	Do you think humans should have more rights than animals	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	7	They should, God meant for it, it says in the Bible that we should have dominion over the animals, we were made in his image and have a soul	1.0	3.0	1.3333	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
415	8	That's interesting! Hopefully humans can realize that we need to work collectively to save animals	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	112.0	26.0	414.0
415	9	yes, too many species die out! in the last 200 years we lost 200o species-learnt that from my child's science book!	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	112.0	17.0	914.0
416	0	pretty sad what's happening to the kids	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	1	It's outrageous.  There is really no excuse, if people feel the need to have these drugs around they need to keep them locked up or really high in a cabinet away from children, same as you would treat a loaded gun	1.6667	4.3333	3.3333	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	10	I think we should start giving hysterectomies and vasectomies to these folks	1.6667	4.0	2.0	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	11	If they do something like that, then yeah.  Because all it would do is put more kids lives in danger if they have more	1.6667	3.6667	2.6667	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	12	the ghettos of america are full of children that are neglected and abused	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	13	they are. it is so sickening to me.  some guy in the news killed his several month old baby by throwing him on the ground bc he was mad he lost a video game	2.0	4.6667	3.3333	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	14	did you see the video of the guy in NYC who jumped in front of a train while holding his 5 year old daughter	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	15	No, but that is the same thing!  like, what the heck!?  and meanwhile there are couples out there just desperate to have a baby who would give these children a loving home.  It's so twisted and messed up and sad.	1.6667	5.0	2.6667	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	16	I think God if there is one has abandoned us	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	17	I think God and other good powers are still there, but there's evil that's out there too.  It's always been there, just manifesting in different ways.  There is still a lot of good in the world, too, gotta remember that	1.3333	4.3333	2.0	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	18	yea that is true its not all doom and gloom	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	19	yeah but I totally get what you are saying, sometimes it really seems that way, especially when you look at some of the awful things people do.  well I must go but I hope you have a really good day full of positive happy things :)  goodbye	0.6667	3.6667	2.0	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	2	exactly and the heroin overdoses is just crazy	1.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	20	goodbye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	3	It's crazy.  There was some woman in the news a few days ago who was giving heroin to her one year old every night to help her sleep.  It killed the baby.	1.6667	4.3333	3.3333	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	4	really? wow the things people do nowadays	1.3333	3.0	2.0	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	5	What is WRONG with people?!?  I have four kids, three are babies, and it is incomprehensible to me that someone would even consider doing something like that!!!!  Sure they wake up at night, sometimes multiple times, but that's part of having a child.	1.6667	4.6667	3.3333	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	6	I have 4 kids too and that is exactly how I feel I can't believe the stories I hear	1.6667	4.0	2.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	7	Yeah this woman was rubbing heroin on the baby's gums each night.  Well she got a batch laced with fentanyl.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
416	8	people like her need to be sterilized	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	301.0	33.0	415.0
416	9	They do.  It's shocking.  And so unfair to the kids	1.6667	4.3333	3.3333	2	301.0	24.0	915.0
417	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	1	I thought it was sad. :( I've heard plenty about the opioid crisis, but not in relation to kids before.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	10	I don't but i can't even imagine the horror the parents must have felt when they arrived home and saw what happpened with their child	1.3333	3.6667	2.6667	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	11	Yeah. :( All it takes is a split second of inattention — and no one can pay attention /all/ the time — and bam. :(	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	12	Yeah! I hope the families that went through this are okay now though	1.0	2.6667	3.0	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	13	Indeed. Going back to the problem, I also think it would help if opioids just weren't prescribed as much as they are. Kids can't get ahold of them if the parents don't have them, after all.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	14	That's true. I have a dog and i get terrified when i eat chocolate because i don't want to drop any	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	15	Yeah. The statistics in America for opioid overdose are horrible and they've been climbing every year. From what I understand the biggest issue is in doctors just over prescribing and then people get addicted largely by accident.	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	16	I wonder if Opioids are even needed, or if there is some alternate solution to prescribe to people that is more safe	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	17	It's hard to say. I expect the solution is less writing it off entirely and just being more judicious when they're handed out. Like how antibiotics are prescribed too liberally and we're creating monster viruses that are immune.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	18	I can agree with that. Let's hope this crisis is dealt with and we have less dying children. It was nice talking to you! bye	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	19	bye!	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	2	Yeah seriously! The parents need to be more responsible	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	3	Yeah, though it's hard to fault them. Children are naturally curious and it only takes you forgetting one time to lead to disaster.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	4	It's so sad because these children had their whole lives ahead of them!	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	5	It's especially sad because they would have had no concept that what they're doing would be a problem. They probably just thought it was candy or something.	1.6667	3.3333	4.0	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	6	Exactly. I'm not sure if you can even prevent this	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	7	Yeah. It mentioned that the kids are figuring out how to open the bottles — maybe better child proofing should be looked in to?	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
417	8	That's a great idea. Do you have children of your own?	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	301.0	17.0	416.0
417	9	Not personally, no, but I used to nanny for several different families so I'm well aware of the trouble they can get themselves into, haha. You?	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	301.0	13.0	916.0
418	0	This is just sad, and I think part of a much larger problem of opioid addiction.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	1	me two prescribed way to often without any follow up	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	10	I wonder if the kids who overdose have any increased susceptibility to addition in the future.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	11	I think I read once you take a substance it turns something on in your brain that will never shutoff wanting more pretty scary	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	12	That	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	13	i think you cut off but yes pretty scary for adults let alone innocent children there minds are so suseptible	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	14	Yeah, I accidentally hit enter. I was just going to say that is what I thought I had heard also. I guess people with children could also be more careful with their prescriptions, like not letting pills lay around or maybe keep them in a safe.	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	15	yeah only take them in one place and thoroughly check one hasnt fallen before leaving	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	16	It seems so simple, but apparently it is not what is happening.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	17	true maybe there in so much pain and have no help things just get lost in translation until its to late, maybe telling the kids pills are bad and to gve them to mom or dad if founf would be good	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	18	It seems crazy to me that the kids would actually ingest the pills, I would think as soon as they tasted it, it would taste so bad that they would spit it out. I guess it happens though.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	19	true i feel bad because it must scare them so much the effects after	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	2	Yeah, the kids are probably getting it more because it is around so much more than it used to be.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	20	Yeah, hopefully though they do feel bad and it doesn't happen more than once to the same child.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	21	agreed! it has been a great chat! bye	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	22	Yeah, nice talking to you! bye	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	3	exactly and its crazy they are figuring out how to get into childproof caps	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	4	My kids could figure those out when they were pretty young.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	5	oh man well maybe they can develop a locking system with a code	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	6	That's a great idea! Like on a padlock.	0.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	7	yes! similar cap just have to put in numbers seems to be cheap	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
418	8	Or like a combination - turn cap right to 21, then left to 12.... l	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	301.0	57.0	417.0
418	9	Yes! that's hard for even adults to break could be a great new tool	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	917.0
419	0	Hello what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	1	I think some people just shouldn't be parents, what about you?	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	10	I agree. Childrens lives are in danger because of so many careless adults	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	11	yeah it starts at home with parents and when parents arent any good who else is there to save them	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	12	That's true. Even though what the parents did was terrible, it was not on purpose and i hope they have a somewhat decent life moving forward	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	13	yeah it was an accident only	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	14	How would you feel if you were the aprent in the situation	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	15	if i was the parent here i would probably be tracing back my steps to see where i dropped the pill and make sure it never happens again. you?	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	16	I would most likely do the same. I would probably be in depression for many years as well	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	17	yeah i would always have it on the back of my mind	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	18	Yup! It was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	2	I agree. It's terrible and sad.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	3	imagine leaving pills on the floor while being a parent with kids in the house	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	4	Exactly! i don't think i would ever forgive myself if i killed my own child.	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	5	even just drugging my own child I would never forgive myself!	2.0	4.0	2.3333	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	6	Do you think people like this should not be allowed to have children forever?	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	7	I think so, what do you think?	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
419	8	I think so as well! I feel like it's hard for people to change.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	301.0	17.0	418.0
419	9	yeah cps needs to do a better job out there	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	301.0	19.0	918.0
420	0	So what did  you think of this	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	1	Crazy this is happening more today then back when	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	10	yeah seriously but the kind of people who are abusing a bunch of opioids and benzos probably aren't paying attention to that anyway or would forget to do it.	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	11	yeah but im sure some of these people are just over worked tired parents who forget or dont know	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	12	"maybe there are some, but I don't know.  Every case I've read has been a drug user, I""ve never even seen one where it was a legitimate prescription.  I'm sure they exist though.  But being over worked or tired is still no excuse.  I'm constantly overworked and tired and would never forget to secure something that could harm my child.  good grief."	1.6667	4.0	1.3333	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	13	I think doctors need to prescribe less crazy drugs then these or something	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	14	yeah no doubt!  and people need to get a grip on their own behavior.  stop abusing drugs if you're going to be a parent.	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	15	yeah my mom got addicted and abandoned all five of us ill never understand	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	16	"I""m so sorry that happened to you, I'm sure that's been very hard.  My husband's mom did the same thing to him."	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	17	thank you its been very hard especially because its usually the dad who leaves have not found many with the same story but reading articles like this im glad it didnt happen near me	1.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	18	Yeah really, it's not usually a mother who leaves her children.  His mom tries to come around now and he won't even acknowledge her, she's still messed up.  Well it's been good talking to you, I hope you have a nice afternoon and take care.  bye!	1.0	3.3333	2.0	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	19	you as well bye	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	2	I think it's ridiculous.  As a mother of four, three of whom are under age four, I think it's inexcusable people can't f ind a way to keep their drugs pout of reach	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	3	I agree but who knows what is going on in there life	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	4	yeah but it's still no excuse.  it feels like I read about a baby overdosing almost every week, and the majority of the time the parent is abusing the drugs	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	5	Yeah I can see that just being neglectful	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	6	highly neglectful	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	7	maybe the drug companys should make it so you have to put in a code to get into them	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
420	8	yeah that could work.  I mean it should be up to the consumer really, b ut if people are going to be so irresponsible then I guess the drug companies doing something is better than nothing.  At least it would protect the poor babies.	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	1	301.0	24.0	419.0
420	9	yeah I agree and maybe doctors can educate people more on how easily kids can get into and die from them	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	301.0	53.0	919.0
421	0	its a shame what happened to the flamingo	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	1	Yeah what on earth is wrong with that guy?  Who does something like that?	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	10	they run around all day in the fields I have no ticks their great at that	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	11	oh do they eat them or what?  that is good.  I'm scared of ticks.	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	12	yea they eat all these bugs	0.3333	1.0	1.0	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	13	that's great!  birds are fascinating creatures.  that flamingo danced on its own accord which was neat	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	14	birds are totally smart kind of remind me of mini dinosaurs	0.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	15	yeah I think so too, they have a lot of similarities.  and some are monogamous which is neat	0.0	2.0	1.6667	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	16	mating for life better then humans lol	0.0	1.6667	1.0	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	17	yeah no doubt!	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	18	we need to protect these endangered species	0.0	3.0	1.6667	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	19	yeah no one does anything until it's too late	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	2	must be drunk no excuse though	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	20	exactly and then we all cry about it	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	21	yeah but no one wants to do anything.  Well I must go, it's been nice talking to you, have a good day.  goodbye	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	22	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	3	Or just a very sick person, the flamingo was just chilling	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	4	yea you have to be sick in the head and their pretty cool looking birds	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	5	yes, probably a precursor to behavior against other humans as well	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	6	potential serial killer	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	7	yeah that's exactly what I was thinking	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
421	8	I keep chickens I find birds to be cool and the fresh eggs are grea	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	133.0	33.0	420.0
421	9	that is neat!  yeah they are cool, totally undeserving of any sort of abuse like that	0.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	133.0	24.0	920.0
422	0	Hello what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	1	I thought it was sad.  I've never understood pointless cruelty or destruction like this.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	10	I don't think it's ever going to change sadly.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	11	I tend to agree.  I think it's part of our makeup.  We'll always keep striving for dominance and control, over each other and nature.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	12	True. I saw a video of people abusing elephants and it made me want to cry	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	13	Yeah, that's terrible.  Again, I just don't understand it.  Does it make people feel powerful or tough or something?  Or maybe they're just sadists.	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	14	I think sadists or just the fact that they think animals are just a .. thing, with no emotions	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	15	For sure.  I'm sure that's part of it.  I bet the zookeepers at the Busch Gardens are absolutely distraught.  I'm sure they develop close bonds with all those animals.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	16	Definitely. I live in Florida too so Busch Gardens is only a 2 hour drive from me. Very sad	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	17	My grandparents used to live in Florida.  Never went to a Busch Gardens but we went to alligator farms and stuff like that.  Always loved seeing animals.  Hopefully they were all treated well.	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	18	Let's hope things improve in the future for both humans and animals. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	19	Yes, it was nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	2	Poor flamingo was just minding it 's own business and got attacked!	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	3	Yeah, I can't even imagine what was going through the guy's head.  Although I've read that people hurting animals at the zoo isn't all that uncommon.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	4	That's terrible! I've never heard that. I wonder what kind of consequences this man is going to face	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	5	"Hopefully pretty severe.  But yeah, I have no idea what ""animal cruelty"" charges bring."	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	6	I would say at least a couple years in jail! The fact that you can just go up to an animal and slam it to the ground sounds.. disturbing	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	7	For sure.  I also wonder how/why they thought they'd get away with it.  There must have been a lot of people around.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
422	8	Yeah! Exactly. It's sad how not only are we destroying the homes of animals but now we're abusing them as well	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	133.0	17.0	421.0
422	9	Yes, whether it's as a species or as individuals, we tend to be pretty destructive, even sadistic at times.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	133.0	48.0	921.0
424	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	1	My first impression is what is wrong with people.   Why would you pick it up and then throw it down to the ground?   If you hurt animals, something is really off.   What about your?	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	10	no idea either	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	11	Even though it was a horrendous act, I do not see jailing someone.   He should have had to do a lot of community service and pay a hefty fine.  Thoughts?	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	12	he needs a fine and jail time in prison	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	13	You think?   Our prisons are overflowing.	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	14	yep and those prisons have people that are unfairly in prison. i think you mean we need a better justice system.	1.3333	3.0	1.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	15	Totally agree.  The Netflix show about the Central Park murder was so distressing.  Did you see it?	1.6667	3.3333	1.0	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	16	yeah i believe so	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	17	All those boys that did nothing were jailed.   The only reason they were chosen was because they were in the area and the police and DA just wanted to find someone quickly.  (:	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	18	yep happens everyday in america unfotunately. some people make money off having full prisons	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	19	It's very very sad.   I have enjoyed chatting with you.   Please have a great day.  goodbye	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	2	Exactly. Imagine having that cold of a heart that you kill a harmless animal in that manner.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	20	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	3	I am a firm believer that if you do hurt animals you are either a psychopath or sociopath.    I wonder if the story was true about Pinky?	1.3333	4.0	1.6667	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	4	I think its a real story. Witnesses said that he picked up a different flamingo but put it down before getting the other one.	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	5	I wonder what was different in his mind on the second flamingo?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	6	it was probably smaller	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	7	I wish they had included the video of Pinky dancing :)	0.3333	1.0	0.6667	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
424	8	pinky was already 19 years old thats sad	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	133.0	19.0	423.0
424	9	It is.   I have no idea what the life span is of a flamingo?   Do you?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	133.0	8.0	923.0
426	0	its a shame with the drought	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	1	It's terrible what is happening to the world today!	1.3333	3.0	2.6667	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	10	i do i have a cat chickens goats and sheep	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	11	Wow. Do you feel compassion or anything for them if htye were to get hurt?	1.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	12	for sure I'm treating my goats foot right now	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	13	Awesome. How long have you had this goat?	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	14	this one I just got this summer I paid a lot for her 300 bucks	0.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	15	That's a pretty good deal. I hope you will treat it well because it's sad what humans are doing to animals.	0.3333	3.0	1.3333	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	16	I will but I will also eat all of her male offspring slit their throat most likely and make delicious goat tacos	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	17	That's interesting. Hopefully you will keep it more as a pet	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	18	only the females stay as pets no use for the males just need to keep one around for breeding the rest in the freezer to feed my family	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	19	Cool! Well it was nice talking to you. bye	0.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	2	I know so much distruction	1.6667	2.0	2.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	3	Do you think it is human caused?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	4	maybe probably thoug	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	5	I wonder what will be done to fix the destruction.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	6	probably nothing humans don't really care	2.0	1.0	1.6667	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	7	I care! I wish that i could donate to these wildlife charities	0.6667	3.3333	2.0	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
426	8	I need donations before the animals	1.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	33.0	425.0
426	9	lol that's a good point. Do you own any pets or anything?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	397.0	17.0	925.0
427	0	hey were you as sad as me about whats going on	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	1	Yeah. I think we tend to forget how important water is in the US (or at least some parts), but wow.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	10	yeah but they said if its not figired out soon this will happen for years to come how scary	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	11	True. And with the replenishing season not coming until January, that's a long wait.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	12	true i wonder what can/will be done for these animals, they should have crews go along and pick up fish struggling to relocate them	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	13	The question would be relocate where? If you move populations like that you run the risk of messing up the ecological balance of the new place.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	14	maybe a nearby zoo to rehabiliate or hold them to wait for the water to comeback	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	15	Do zoos usually have fish populations? idk. Maybe a wildlife reservation could take on some of the land animals, but I'm not familiar with best practices for moving fish.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	16	yeah where i am they have fish farms and hatcherys you can go visit maybe something of that nature and our zoos have huge aquariums for fish	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	17	Ah okay, yeah a fish hatchery would work. But then they might get eaten and that's slightly self defeating haha. :P It's so sad to think of all the animals getting caught in the mud and sediment. :( I can't imagine the fall out from a 520 or whatever empty river.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	18	oh i know the image of them breathing in mud will be stuck with me all day its so sad	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	19	:( :( It's an awful way to go. Natural disasters are hard to wrap your mind around because it reminds you of how much we just can't fix.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	2	yeah when animals thrive on it and people need those animals it can ruin alot	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	20	I know so horrible! its been a great chat bye!	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	21	bye!	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	3	Yeah. I was stunned when it said 80% of the capybaras had died. That's insane.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	4	yeah i wonder if they are endanger of extinction now so sad	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	5	Probably not overall, but certainly that segment is. And the one that was like 98% gone, I forget the species, but yikes.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	6	such large numbers you think more would be deing done to help	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	7	Yeah. It sounds like the governments didn't handle it well at all.	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
427	8	they probably dont have enough money or resources	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	397.0	53.0	426.0
427	9	I mean, the article made it seems like the two governments took responsibility for it, so. It seems like the way water was divided between Paraguay and Argentina was partially responsible for the discrepancy.	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	13.0	926.0
428	0	Well, I thought this was sad for the animals.  But it's one of those situations where there's not much anyone can do.  What was your take on it?	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	1	Yeah, we need to do better in protecting these animals.	0.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	10	I wonder why they are not doing it there, did it say?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	11	no idea, why do you think they haven't done it yet?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	12	Perhaps financial reasons, what do you think?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	13	Most likely. Paraguay isn't the richest country	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	14	Yeah I don't know much about it but it doesn't seem like a very industrialized, thriving nation	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	15	yep I've heard about Paraguay when their team is participating in a world cup	0.6667	0.6667	0.6667	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	16	hahaha yeah, same.  B ut not much economic news	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	17	yeah never hear anything about them lol	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	18	me either, they're like a ghost country	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	19	yeah i dont even know who their president is or if they have one. but back to the article, I hope things change and they find a way to save these animals	0.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	2	What do you think can be done?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	20	Yeah I don't know either.  Are they even a democracy or what?  Anyway, I hope things change, too, for the sake of the animals.  well I must go, it's been nice speaking with you.  goodbye	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	21	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	3	I think educating people on the consequences but at this point I don't know what can be done to be honest. What about you?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	4	I agree, I think it's really up to nature which we cannot control	2.0	2.0	1.0	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	5	What do you think might of caused the river to go dry?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	6	My guess would be just natural fluctuations in the weather.  Kinda hard to say.  I guess it could be any number of things really.	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	7	I think they should build more artifical canals and stuff like that if possible.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
428	8	That could possibly help, I think it would be worth exploring ideas like that.  I wonder if they have?	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	397.0	24.0	427.0
428	9	I think the article said that was being done in some countries	0.6667	1.0	1.0	2	397.0	19.0	927.0
429	0	I think climate change is going effect us all very soon.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	1	I don't know if it is or isn't, but this seems to be effecting the population of wildlife in this area right now. It makes me so sad to think of these poor animals trying to find water.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	10	Do you believe in climate change?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	11	I believe in climate change. The climate has obviously changed a lot over the time the earth has existed. I don't know how much of climate changes is due to people or to natural changes.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	12	Yeah that is a real debate, I think it is man caused like the river issues in this story.	2.0	1.3333	1.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	13	I think in this situation, they are obviously having  a drought this season. I don't think one or two years of drought would necessarily signify climate change. And the larger problem is that people are taking the water for their own uses and leaving the area dry.	2.0	2.0	1.6667	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	14	I agree that droughts are natural and they happen. This is a real complex issue.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	15	Yeah, I agree! I don't think we are going to solve it in this short conversation!	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	16	Yeah, I think this debate will go on for a long time.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	17	It's been good chatting with you!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	18	You too! bye	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	2	Yeah the animals are suffering	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	3	It seems like it might be partly a political issue because the area forms the border of two countries, and one side is fine with water.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	4	I agree with that, but the animals do not care about politics	2.0	2.0	1.6667	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	5	They don't care, but it seems that the two countries have to figure out a way to keep this from happening.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	6	I agree, but who should be in charge of enforcing environmental rules?	0.3333	2.0	1.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	7	That's a good question. I guess I am naive in thinking that the countries would work together.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
429	8	Yeah I don't think they will work together.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	397.0	30.0	428.0
429	9	I think Paraguay, the side that is bad, is the side being accused of mismanagement. So maybe if they figure out a way to use the water better, they can help.	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	397.0	57.0	928.0
430	0	hi what you think my friend?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	1	I definitely thought it was sad for the animals although it did not pull at my heartstrings like some of the other stories I have read on here.  What did you think	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	10	I agree, most of the money goes to bad intentions!	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	11	yeah it is sad that that is the case	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	12	I wish the money could help the animals somehow. They really need it	0.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	13	yeah they can't even advocate for themselves	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	14	Yes! I definitely feel guilty because ive littered before and not recycle	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	15	I do not recycle either but it is very difficult where I Live.  I try to make up in other ways.	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	16	That is very good. You sound like a great person!	0.0	3.0	1.3333	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	17	well I don't think I'm really making a difference.  I use a lot of plastic bottles.  But anyway, like you I try to be aware of my consumption but it is hard.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	18	I agree. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	19	you too!  bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	2	I feel sad because even though it's not as sad now, it will affect them mroe in the future	2.0	2.3333	3.0	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	3	yeah no doubt and they are really helpless victims of the whole thing	2.0	2.3333	3.6667	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	4	It's because of humans do you think?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	5	yes most definitely, and I mean natural causes such as the drought surely play a part but it seems people could do something to help	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	6	I wish there was a way we can donate	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	7	yeah there might be if you looked?	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
430	8	There are charity but you never know if the money actually goes to the right places	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	397.0	17.0	429.0
430	9	yeah that is why I am suspicious of charity.  it seems a lot are wasteful	2.0	2.6667	1.0	2	397.0	24.0	929.0
432	0	Some of these articles are so hard to read, I can't even imagine having to live like this.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	1	It's so sad what happened to the soldiers i agree	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	10	Yeah, I hope my children and grandchildren are able to have the same.	0.0	3.0	2.3333	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	11	I'm sure they will. I just hope global warming doesn't affect them.	0.0	2.6667	2.0	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	12	I hope so. I really wish that no one would have to live like the people in that article.	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	13	True. I wonder how long this is goign to continue for	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	14	Me too, it seems that that area will never be peaceful.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	15	I hope in the next 5 years, things will be better.	0.0	2.3333	2.0	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	16	Yeah, me too. It's been nice chatting with you!	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	17	nice chatting with you! bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	18	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	2	And the civilians. There was the hospital that Doctors without Borders had that was hit on mistake. Apparently there were many civilian lives taken.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	3	I read that too, it's so sad. I can't even imagine just going about your business and then getting bombed.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	4	I know. I try to put myself in their shoes to feel what it would be like, but I can't even begin to realize what it would be like.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	5	It would definitely hurt lol. I feel bad for the families of the civilians	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	6	Yeah, the article said that the families were trying to parade through the streets with the bodies of their children that had died.	1.6667	4.0	3.0	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	7	that sounds very sad. and disturbing...	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
432	8	Very, this article definitely makes me realize how lucky I am to live in the US.	0.6667	3.6667	2.3333	1	13.0	57.0	431.0
432	9	I agree. We have everything we need and no wars.	0.0	3.0	1.6667	2	13.0	17.0	931.0
433	0	I wonder what discipline happened to the people who ordered the airstrike?	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	1	That iis interesting to think about. I wonder who was that careless. It is scary that someone so reactive has that kind of power.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	10	I did not like how they stopped the people from protesting	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	11	imagine if that happened in the united states by another government that would be a big deal.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	12	I think this makes more terrorist than it helps	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	13	i agree i think at some point we should realize we are doing more harm than good.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	14	I think it is time for us to leave some parts of the middle east alone.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	15	yes, those poor people have more of a chance of dying with america over there accidentally killing people	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	16	I agree. I know that sometimes I feel like life is hard than reading stories like this really makes me think about how good I have it.	0.6667	4.0	2.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	17	it has a way of making us grateful that our country is strong but also sad that it does stuff like this	1.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	18	agreed.	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	19	this reminds me of a podcast i watched where companies say theyre doing good by for example donating a pair of sneakers to people in africa who are poverty striken. to the outside world this looks great and feels like it is a good deed. But many people in poverty in africa do not wear shoes. they don't need sneakers. they need clean water and seeds to prossper. This is similair to how with war we think killing everyone is going to solve the problem but it won't. it's a facade to look like were doing something good when it is actually not helping at all.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	2	I agree, people do not respect life anymore.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	20	Wow, I never thought about it like that. Do you remember the name of the podcast?	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	21	yes, it was a joe rogan podcast I believe the one with Kevin hart as a guest.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	22	I think I only watched the youtube clips of that one, I must go back and listen to the whole thing.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	23	ahh it was a very informative podcast. I highly recommend! None of the political agenda stuff.	0.0	3.0	1.0	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	24	Well It was great talking with you! bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	25	you as well! bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	3	this is true. Scary hearing about it  I cannot imagine living there.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	4	what about being a person working for doctors without boarders and being killed trying to help.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	5	that is mind boggling and so sad. I remember reading that 16 people were disciplined for this.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	6	I wonder who has the final say on an airstrike like that	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	7	scary stuff something needs to change.	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
433	8	I agree, we can not be worst than the people we are fights.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	13.0	30.0	432.0
433	9	Also, it seems like a crazy idea that they accidentally killed that many people seems odd.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	13.0	16.0	932.0
434	0	what did you think about it?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	1	I think it's really unfortunate, and I don't blame people in the middle east for hating the West.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	10	well we have to sell the bombs to others so they can control their population with bullets its spreading democracy just like the founding fathers wanted it	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	11	yeah that's true this is just a crusade to further our western ways.	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	12	either you listen to us and follow our rules or we sanction and bomb you to oblivion seems fair to me	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	13	Yeah we're the big dogs fuck everyone else!	1.3333	3.6667	1.6667	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	14	America Fuck YEA!!!	0.6667	4.3333	1.6667	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	15	well, I hope we don't make everyone else in the world hate us, and cause another 9/11 with your plan though..	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	16	there is nothing we can do to stop the inevitable destruction of us all so like prince said party like its 1999	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	17	yolo amirite?	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	13.0	49.0	933.0

434	3	lol ok.  Still sucks to have to move your dead kids on a blanket because some other country bombed you.	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	4	they are terrorists	2.0	3.0	1.6667	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	5	only the terrorists and taliban are terrorists.  not all the civilians caught in the backlash.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	6	the civilians are collateral	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	7	don't you wish that wasn't the case though?	1.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
434	8	I suppose but we have to bomb someone or else little Timmy's dad won't have a job making bombs and then our economy would tank	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	13.0	33.0	433.0
434	9	i see how this is going... well why don't we just do more testing instead of bombing actual people	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	13.0	49.0	933.0
435	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	1	I think it was terrible that there were so many fatalities following this airstrike.	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	10	what do you think can be done to stop this conflict?	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	11	I think it will take a lot of cooperation to end the conflict. I dont know if its even possible at this point.	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	12	Yeah both sides must work together to end all of this once and for all	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	13	I hope they can do so	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	14	Yep hope so	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	15	It will take a lot of effort on both sides though	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	16	That seems so impossible to achieve.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	17	And the fighting has been going on so long now	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	18	as a kid I remember watching the news about this and to think its still going on is so crazy.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	19	I wish it could be resolved sonn	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	2	Yeah I didnt even know the troops were still in Afghanistan	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	20	agreed on everything. good chat. bye	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	21	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	3	It is sad to lose both US troops and Afghan civilians.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	4	yeah that is depressing	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	5	I wonder when the fighting there will end	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	6	seems like it will never end	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	7	So sad that the people of that area have to put up with all of this going on	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
435	8	Agree, its crazy that they dont pack up and head elsewhere. Then again, most people can't.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	13.0	19.0	434.0
435	9	A tragic situation to be caught up in	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	13.0	43.0	934.0
436	0	Hello! What did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	1	hello, I thought it was very interesting	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	10	Do you own any pets?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	11	nope, lots of squirrels around here though	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	12	I would try to avoid them as much as possible! I wonder what happened to the people that got affected by the squirrels	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	13	I'm not sure, did the article mention confirmed cases of transmission?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	14	I think it did. Leprosy is the worst though. You just lose body parts	2.0	1.3333	2.0	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	15	well, it's because they aren't able to notice when their body parts bump into stuff right	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	16	I think so. It's just sad. Something so unexpected like a squirrel can kill you	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	17	not just that but it would also make people freaked out to be near you, since the condition is so transmissible	2.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	18	It's just a terrible case overall. It was nice talking to you! bye	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	19	ok, bye	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	2	It's so disturbing that diseases are being carried around.	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	3	a little, but I never hear about people having leprosy	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	4	Me neither but just imagine if you got bit by a squirrel and you some how got it.. it's terrifying	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	5	yeah that is pretty scary. I don't think there is a cure?	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	6	I don't believe so. There are always squirrels in front of my house. I'm scared to leave the house now	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	7	Even if you don't, if you had a cat or something I wonder if it could be a transmission vector	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
436	8	I have a dog, now you're making me nervous!	1.3333	3.0	2.0	1	308.0	17.0	435.0
436	9	haha sorry	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	308.0	52.0	935.0
437	0	Can you believe leporosy of all thjings is making a comeback in squirrels?	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	1	yes its crazy i havent heard that word used in a while!	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	10	Im certain some animal rights groups would be interested if they even know about it. This is the first Im hearing of the issue	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	11	Same here it probably just hasnt made its way over here yet we americans like to stay in our bubble	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	12	Probably so. I hope it does nto spread here too	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	13	well it said we mostly have grey squirrels and they cant get it so hopefully not!	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	14	I cant imagine the pain the animals must be in	2.0	3.0	4.3333	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	15	yeah there poor skin swollen and there so little and defenseless	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	16	I truly hope something can be done to combat the disease	0.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	17	im sure something in science will come about soon	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	18	Yes we can only hope so	0.0	2.0	2.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	19	poor little guys. its been so nice to talk with you	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	2	I know! Those poor little animals	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	20	nice talking with you. goodbye	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	21	bye!	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	3	they must be really suffering at the end it is so sad	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	4	It must be truly terrible for them	2.0	3.0	4.3333	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	5	they should make a task force to try and scoop infected ones up to bring somewhere and help	1.3333	2.0	3.3333	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	6	I wonder how effective that might be	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	7	something or if you see one you can report it to local animal society	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
437	8	Yeah I think that might help somewhat.	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	308.0	43.0	436.0
437	9	something I now there really important over there so i wonder if people would be willing to help	0.6667	2.0	2.0	2	308.0	53.0	936.0
438	0	I wasn't aware that only three species of mammal can carry leprosy.	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	1	I agree . Astonishing that leprosy still affectrs 385,000 people around the world still.	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	10	Yeah, it's a shame that the species of squirrel that has been found to carry the disease is also endangered.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	11	It's crazy how Leprosy has been known since biblical times lol	0.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	12	Right? All this time and we still haven't found a cure. Apparently, it also goes by the name of Hansen's disease. Did you know there are leper colonies in Hawaii?	1.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	13	did not know that.	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	14	Yep, and apparently one of the biggest risk factors for contracting leprosy is living in poverty. There's still plenty of that to go around.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	15	you really have to take care of yourself with all these diseases going around.	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	16	Have you ever had first hand experience with a serious illness?	1.0	0.6667	1.6667	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	17	not really. I have family members with diabetes and high blood pressure that's the most. what about you?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	18	"I've dealt with food poisoning on a couple of different occasions, but nothing I would label as ""serious."" Thanks for chatting and being so responsive. bye"	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	2	No kidding! Also, most representations of the disease in the media are flagrantly misleading.	1.3333	3.0	1.0	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	3	The media seems to always mislead us	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	4	You certainly don't see a lot of credible documentaries on most media outlets. Do you live in an area with populations of armadillos?	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	5	not really, do you?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	6	Actually, yes. They have been moving northward due to changing temperatures in the south and it's not uncommon to see them on roadways. They're cute but now i'm inclined to keep my distance.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	7	what's wrong with armadillos? I'm clueless about them.	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
438	8	They carry leprosy that can be transferred to humans according to the article.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	308.0	25.0	437.0
438	9	According to the article. there is no evidence of squirrel to human transmission so thats a good thing	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	308.0	19.0	937.0
439	0	I didn't know leprosy was still around	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	1	Yeah i remember reading about it in other countries, but I didn't know it was still in America.  Definitely didn't know squirrels carried it.	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	10	I don't really care about it we're making america great again cant	1.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	11	Sure doesn't sound like you don't care, you pivoted from leprosy squirrels to Jesus and cut off dicks reeeal quick	1.6667	3.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	12	I have mental issues the FBI profiled me once	2.0	2.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	13	Lol good to know.  Anyway, thanks to the article, I now know to keep my distance from Armadillos.	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	14	don't forget about prarie dogs they carry the hunta virus	1.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	15	What's the hunta virus?	1.3333	2.3333	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	16	its a cousin of ebola I find viruses to be really intersting	1.6667	3.0	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	17	Do you think they go to cookouts together, and their virus parents brag about what great virus's they've become?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	18	I think ebola makes a great rack of ribs and hunta is a little jeoulous	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	19	hunta talks so much shit about ebola's ribs to their nephew malaria...	1.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	2	Jesus will cure it no worries	0.6667	2.6667	1.0	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	20	there's always a fight between bubonic plague and polio	1.3333	2.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	21	Mumps is always getting drunk and groping his cousins wives.	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	22	yea but they knew you can't marry the flu those girls are hussies	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	23	they seriously get around, i personally got fucked by the flu twice last year.	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	24	haha nice chatting with you bye	0.6667	2.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	25	lol bye	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	3	Thanks God for Jesus, taking care of his creation, humans, but fucking all the other ones he made...	1.3333	3.0	1.0	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	4	If this is taking care of us I'd hate to see what not taking care of us would look like	1.0	3.3333	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	5	Sorry, I should clarify, he's taking care of his chosen people. Western white civilization.	1.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	6	well my previous statement still stands the whites are all doped up on heroin now and chopping their dicks off to become women	2.0	3.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	7	Lol only like 1% of em.  At least that's something they're choosing to do, and not involuntarily getting infected with squirrel leprosy though!	1.3333	3.0	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
439	8	that makes it worse lol and i'm pretty sure its more then 1% that are addicts but the trannies are probably 1 percent	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	1	308.0	33.0	438.0
439	9	eh, I wouldn't let that kind of stuff bother you though, it's annoying, but it really doesn't affect you if you don't let it.	1.6667	3.0	0.6667	2	308.0	49.0	938.0
440	0	what did you think?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	308.0	33.0	439.0

440	11	That is crazy I am glad atleast there are drugs to help it now	0.0	3.0	2.3333	2	308.0	53.0	939.0
440	12	yes there is they should find a cure soon but then something else will come up and that's nature	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	308.0	33.0	439.0
440	13	very true like the superbugs doctors are warning about	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	2	308.0	53.0	939.0

440	4	nature is fascinating in its adaptability	0.3333	2.0	2.0	1	308.0	33.0	439.0
440	5	yes mystery diseases like this freak me out	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	308.0	53.0	939.0
440	6	There's new viruses all the time its just a matter of time till something gets us	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	308.0	33.0	439.0
440	7	That is so horrifying to think about!	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	308.0	53.0	939.0
440	8	I know look at HIV didn't exist till the 80s	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	308.0	33.0	439.0
440	9	Very true I wonder how that came about, I watched rent and that queens movie freaked me out	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	308.0	53.0	939.0
441	0	its a shame with the bombing but what can you do	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	1	It's so sad. It's unfortunate the children had to grow up in that environment.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	10	I care more about the kids dying in chicago then some towel heads in Syria	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	11	I live in Chicago and it's definitely sad what is going on there. I care about all children, doesn't matter where they're from!	1.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	12	but if you could only save one child which one would you pick some kid from chicago or some kid from syria?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	13	That's a good question. I would say whoever is suffering more	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	14	equal amount of suffering pick one!	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	15	Then i will have to say Chicago only because it's closer to me and hits home more	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	16	we need to help our own first before we send money anywhere else stop the illegals from coming in we cant even take care of what we have now	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	17	I agree. we need to make America great again	0.0	2.0	1.0	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	18	we spend billions in giving illegals welfare	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	19	I definitely did not know that . It was nice talking to you! bye	1.0	2.0	0.6667	2	7.0	17.0	940.0

441	3	True but i still feel bad. I read there was babies under the buildings	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	4	At least it wasn't american bombs this time I think the russians made these	2.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	5	True. I did read recent news about Americans bombing innocent civilians too though :(	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	6	that's everyday we just don't care about it I would say on any given day America is responsible for at least 200 innocent dead people around the world	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	7	I wonder if there's anything that can be done to decrease the amount of civilian deaths	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
441	8	no only increase it the military industrial complex needs more blood so little timmy's dad has a job	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	7.0	33.0	440.0
441	9	Who's Timmy? Also, i hope the families are all okay after this terrible incident.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	7.0	17.0	940.0
442	0	Airstrikes on civilians are always the worst. :(	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	1	Yeah, this is pretty heartbreaking to read.  Such a terrible situation without any real valid solution in sight.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	10	Agreed. Especially when there's kids involved.	2.0	2.6667	3.6667	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	11	Yeah exactly that was really the worst part of all.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	12	Yeah. There was a really good documentary about the child refugees coming out of Aleppo a while ago. Heartbreaking. :(	1.3333	3.6667	3.0	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	13	I did not see that, I can't even bear to watch things like that.  I'm sure it was moving though	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	14	Yeah. :( I can't even imagine... you're just minding your own business and then bam. Your house is gone.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	15	Yeah your whole life is gone.  I feel so grateful to live in the USA.	0.6667	3.6667	3.6667	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	16	For sure. We have our problems, but airstrikes aren't one of them. :/	1.0	3.0	3.0	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	17	Yeah, nothing even close to that.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	18	Indeed. I think that about covers it — did you have more to add?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	19	No, just that this is terrible.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye	1.0	2.3333	3.0	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	2	"Yeah. It reminded me of when the independent candidate for pres in 2016 asked ""What's Aleppo?"". To quote this article, Not Pompeii. :/"	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	20	goodbye <3	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	3	What moron made that statement?  But yeah, that is really sad.  And the whole area is just constantly in violent conflict it seems.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	4	Yeah. 300 people in just a handful of days... that's awful.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	5	Yeah that is outrageous.  I guess it is these terrorist groups that are causing all this?	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	6	If I recall correctly it was rebels vs the syrian government, but I could be wrong.	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	7	You are probably right, who are these rebels, though?	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
442	8	I think it was Shiite Muslims who disagreed with the way Syria was being run (Syria is mostly Sunni Muslims). The Syrian government is not known for its care of people.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	7.0	13.0	441.0
442	9	Oh ok, that makes sense.  I think I hae read the same thing.  Regardless, it doesn't matter to the victims of these tragedies.  It's very unfair to them.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	7.0	24.0	941.0
443	0	It so distrubing reading about the death and devastation is allepo	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	1	I agree, living under those conditions must be horrible.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	10	wow living there must feel very hopeless. I will never understand how people can be so evil	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	11	me either, we just have to pray and hope for the best for them.	1.3333	3.0	3.6667	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	12	I wish there was a way to help but i think you're right it's such a big problem that is hard to fix	1.0	3.0	2.6667	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	13	Yeah very complex and very sad.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	14	it's nice that people on twitter are spreading awareness maybe get the attention of the world if many people talk about it	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	15	That is nice, I think most people in this world are kind.	0.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	16	I totally agreethe news likes to make everyone scared of eachother but I think most people want to help others	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	17	Some times the news of everything horrible is overwhelming but I feel it is important to hear the stories.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	18	that is very true!	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	19	It was very nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	2	Hearing that a little boy was covered in blood and dust is truely heartbreaking	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	20	you as well bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	3	I agree. I hope the war ends soon	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	4	Sound like they need some allies to help get rid of the bad guys	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	5	To be honest it so confusing on who is the bad guys	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	6	That is very true it;s hard to find them when they blend in	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	7	Yeah and at one point they said the president of the country was bombing and gassing his own people.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
443	8	i heard about that. It is insane that nothing is really being done to help the innocent people.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	7.0	16.0	442.0
443	9	Some countries are turning them away	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	7.0	30.0	942.0
444	0	what did you think?	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	1	What a hard article to read about	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	10	yes it does still feel bad for that family though	2.0	2.0	3.3333	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	11	I do to i cant imagine losing everyone what do you do	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	12	I would lose it what's the point of being alive	2.0	2.3333	4.0	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	13	me two i would not want to go on	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	14	we are lucky not having to deal with this stuff	0.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	15	I agree I dont know how these people do it	2.0	1.6667	2.6667	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	16	they get used to it I suppose	1.3333	1.3333	2.3333	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	17	What a horrible quality of life im so thankfulto live here	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	18	yes it is nice chatting bye	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	2	I know the baby being killed was tough	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	3	Yeah I cant imagine seeing that after math	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	4	war what is it good for? absolutely nothing	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	5	exactly just killing innocent people	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	6	its tough	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	7	should be a better way	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
444	8	its too profitable for certain people	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	7.0	33.0	443.0
444	9	money does make the world go around	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	2	7.0	53.0	943.0
446	0	Hey there, what did you think of the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	1	I just hate it so much when civilians, who had nothing to do with the conflict and were minding their own business, get targeted like this :(	2.0	4.0	4.0	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	10	Yeah it was sad to read. I hope the families of the lost ones will be able to live a happy life in the future	1.3333	3.6667	3.6667	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	11	Hard to do that, unfortunately, when like in this case neither side seems willing to budge even a bit.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	12	I agree. I wish there was a way that we can help	0.6667	3.0	3.0	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	13	Yeah. Tensions between Pakistan and India have been tense since they were split in the 40s and it feels like nothing's really changed.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	14	I don't think it will get better anytime soon unfortunately and it sucks there's nothing that can be done to fix it	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	15	Just hope and work to get people out and into better situations, I guess.	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	16	Would you be okay if USA were to accept people from that country into our own?	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	17	Yep. I have zero qualms about it, actually.	0.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	18	Sounds like you're a great person. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	19	You too! bye <3	0.0	2.6667	1.0	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	2	Exactly! And to think of the families they left behind as well	1.6667	3.3333	3.3333	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	3	Like, I can't imagine finding out my mom was literally just in the house doing chores or whatever and then... gone.	2.0	4.3333	4.0	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	4	It's terrifying. I think i would go in to severe depression	2.0	4.3333	4.6667	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	5	Yeah. The fact that it was during what was supposed to be a cease fire is even worse.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	6	I'm not sure if it was in the article, but i hope no children were harmed!	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	7	I think they just said thirteen civilians, didn't mention age. But when kids are involved they usually say so, I think.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
446	8	That's good. I read an article this morning about innocent civilians being killed..and there were babies involved	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	11.0	17.0	445.0
446	9	Oh no that's awful. :(	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	11.0	13.0	945.0
447	0	This was pretty sad, it's always awful when civilians are caught up in these things	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	1	yea but these people are always fighting each other even though their the same people	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	10	hmm, what makes you think that?  sounds a bit radical to me	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	11	its simple math really look at the amount of global debt being piled on its already gone past the tipping point and now central banks are experimenting with negative interest rates everyone knows where this is headed no president or prime minister is going to stop it they just hope it doesn't all implode on their watch	1.6667	2.6667	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	12	maybe so, who knows.  I just try to live my simple little life and be happy.  It's unfortunate for these people caught up in the crossfire though	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	13	live your life but slowly prepare yourself for the collapse and yea sucks to be pawns	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	14	"I'm not really worried about the ""collapse"" to be honest.  People have been fearing that since 2000.  Nothing has yet to happen.  It's like climate change in my opinion, fears blown out of proportion.  But who knows, guess time will tell"	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	15	it did happen in 2008 but it wasn't allowed to fully happen they kicked the can down the road bought some more time but I will tell you that they just created a much larger bubble and 2008 will look like a picnic	1.6667	3.0	1.0	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	16	2008 was just a recession, those are a naturally occurring part of an economy.  But back to the article, what did you think about the people being harmed?	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	17	is negative interest rates on sovereign rate funds naturally occurring? I thought those people are casualties of the life they were born in to bad luck I suppose	2.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	18	It is very sad for them.  have a nice day, goodbye	1.6667	1.6667	2.3333	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	19	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	2	yeah it seems that way doesn't it	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	3	savages will always be savages	2.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	4	who do you think are the savages in this particular situation	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	5	the people in charge making the decisions to kill each other	2.0	2.3333	1.0	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	6	yeah, wonder why they think that's the best plan	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	7	maybe its a global conspiracy	1.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
447	8	how so?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	11.0	24.0	446.0
447	9	i think there is a conspiracy to bring about a single currency probably based on crypto won't happen till there is a depression and war though	2.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	11.0	33.0	946.0
448	0	Fighting over Kashmir has been going on for decades and doesn't seem to be ending soon.	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	1	Yeah I remember hearing stories about them fighting a long time ago.	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	10	I'm sure there will continue to be skirmishes like this.  But an all-out war between these two countries would be massive, with the potential for nuclear strikes.  I doubt we'll see something like that in our lifetime.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	11	I wouldn't doubt anything anymore to be honest after seeing somebody like Donald Trump getting elected.	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	12	I suppose, but I think there's a difference between casting a ballot for someone and entering into an existential war.  Look at Putin.  He's ruthless.  He hasn't fought a large-scale war.  Everything now is skirmishes and proxy wars and terrorism and stuff like that.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	13	Everyone knows the dangers of nuclear power . Before all they had was airstrikes and guns.	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	14	I thought the last line of the article was sort of funny, that Bollywood directors aren't hiring Pakistani actors because of this.  Just thought that was a sort of trivial way to end the article.	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	15	lol that made me laugh went from serious to comedy real quick	0.0	3.0	0.6667	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	16	Although that may be what the majority of Indian people care most about.  Who knows.  In the US we'd spend a lot of time concerning ourselves with what actors were saying on Twitter.	1.0	2.6667	0.6667	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	17	True USA is the king of social media stuff.	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	18	I guess this article makes me feel better about my life. I don't fear rockets coming in from Canada.	0.3333	3.0	1.0	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	19	yeah that makes sense. We are very lucky to be living here to be honest.	0.0	3.3333	1.0	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	2	They're both nuclear powers so that makes the tensions more meaningful, though they've refrained from using nuclear weapons to this point.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	20	Absolutely.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	21	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	3	Do you think India should face consequences for what they did?	1.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	4	I guess I feel like I don't know enough about the back-and-forth.  I fully believe that terrorist groups exist in Pakistan.  And I think India has a right to defend itself.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	5	Pakistan is definitely known for taking good care of terrorists.	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	6	Indeed.  I'd guess they're typically the cause of any escalation in tensions.	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	7	Wasn't Osama Bin Laden also there in a mansion.	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
448	8	Yes.  Pakistan has a very bad history of harboring terrorists.  And I'm sure there are plenty of radical folks who would like to actively fight India.	2.0	2.3333	1.0	1	11.0	48.0	447.0
448	9	do you think there will be another was between the two?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	11.0	19.0	947.0
450	0	Hi there, what did you think of this?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	1	It is so sad the uprest taking place over there	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	10	yeah totally miserable.  I'm grateful to live in the USA	1.3333	3.6667	3.3333	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	11	Me two we have it so great here we dont deal with issues between places with violence	0.3333	3.0	3.0	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	12	yeah we are truly so lucky	0.3333	3.3333	2.3333	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	13	They should do things like trump sanctions and walls not violence there killing innocent people	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	14	so you think Trump's sanctions and the wall are a good thing?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	15	I really do countries are complying	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	16	YEah I totally agree, I think he is doing a fabulous job.  If only he got the support he needed from the media, what we could do would be incredible	0.3333	3.3333	1.0	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	17	Agree but the media is so bias, obama did most the stuff trump is and never got flack from it its so sad	1.6667	3.0	0.6667	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	18	Yeah absolutely!  It is maddening.  All he got was a bunch of praise and props.  Well I gotta go, have a great day!  bye	1.3333	3.3333	0.6667	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	19	same here bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	2	yeah I really can't imagine living like that, it must be so stressful	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	3	I agree its wierd I always thought india as peaceful love and light	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	4	yeah, same here, albeit a bit impoverished.  I did not realize there was all this conflict and violence with India and Pakistan	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	5	Same here you never really here of this on the news	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	6	no not at all	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	7	I would be so afraid on the daily to live there	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
450	8	right?  me too!  I get worried about things like getting sick, these people are worrying abuout imminent death	1.6667	3.6667	3.3333	1	11.0	24.0	449.0
450	9	exactly there quality of life must be so bad	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	11.0	53.0	949.0
452	0	This particular article was really trying to pull on the heartstrings.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	1	Yes, it was a pretty grisly image it portrayed of what happened to the kitten.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	10	Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!	2.0	3.6667	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	11	Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?	1.3333	2.0	1.0	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	12	Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle.	1.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	13	Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.  In this case it would be interesting to see if the citizens track down the culprit.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	14	Supremely doubtful, it's not like they have the help of law enforcement or anything. They are basically going vigilante in the hopes of solving a case with no evidence or power to investigate.	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	15	I suppose it depends on where the kitten came from.  If someone had a litter and gave them away it could be found out.  Either way I don't really care.	1.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	16	That's the long and short of it right? Wouldn't the time be better spent fostering living pets or something similar?	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	17	I agree.  I feel sad at the thought of a tortured cat.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over a dead cat, just like I don't break down when I see a squirrel squished on the road.	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	18	There are certainly more personal and pressing things to lose sleep over. Well, thanks for chatting today. Have a good one! bye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	19	Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye	0.0	1.6667	0.6667	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	2	Yeah, the amount of detail and effort put into trying to encourage the reader to vicariously live out the last moments of its life was a little off putting.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	3	Yeah, they were clearly trying to influence people to join their cause for justice and animal equality.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	4	That tactic is used by a lot of animal rights groups and frankly, it has the opposite effect on me personally. I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat.	1.6667	3.6667	1.3333	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	5	Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here.	1.6667	3.0	1.0	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	6	Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof.	2.0	3.3333	1.0	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	7	"For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal ""equality.""  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility."	2.0	3.6667	1.0	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
452	8	I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning.	1.6667	3.3333	0.6667	1	182.0	25.0	451.0
452	9	Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim.	1.6667	3.0	0.6667	2	182.0	48.0	951.0
453	0	Hello what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	1	this one truly broke my heart	1.6667	3.6667	4.0	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	10	Same here. I wonder what the owners of the cat did afterwards	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	11	i hope they found the person so they couldnt do this to others	0.3333	3.3333	2.6667	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	12	I agree. I hope that person goes to jail too.	0.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	13	i like how they used this experience to advocate for animals around the us	1.0	3.3333	3.0	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	14	It's interesting. Do you think the person will ever harm another animal?	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	15	oh yes seems ingrained in them to do this to animals people are sick	1.6667	4.0	2.3333	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	16	I hope they don't move on to bigger things and do this to other humans.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	17	i think thats alot what happens its a precursor to murderers	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	18	True. Well it was nice talking to you. bye	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	19	you two thanks bye!	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	2	It was so sad. How can someone do things like this to an animal	2.0	3.0	4.6667	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	3	i dont know to an innocent being that cant protect itself	1.6667	3.0	3.6667	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	4	I couldn't even kill an ant, let alone a cat!	1.6667	3.3333	4.3333	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	5	me two these stories just hurt my heart i didnt even want to keep reading	2.0	3.6667	4.0	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	6	Do you own any pets?	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	7	yes a dog hes three my love how about you	0.3333	3.6667	2.6667	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
453	8	I have a dog too! I would be so sad if someone were to hurt it	1.3333	3.3333	3.6667	1	182.0	17.0	452.0
453	9	i couldnt imagine I would be out for blood there is no excuse for this	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	2	182.0	53.0	952.0
454	0	hey what did you think about the article	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	1	Wow, I thought it was absolutely horrifying, what did you think>	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	10	They probably don't even have enough of a brain to call what they think of a mindset.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	11	yes or even  to call human, so sick.  I'm so disgusted	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	12	they would probably do it again if they could.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	13	oh I bet, they probably already have	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	14	yes people just have not found out most likely.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	15	yes that would be my guess	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	16	that article is something i wont forget	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	17	same here, one of the most striking and disturbing I have read on here.  ugh.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	18	ugh agreed it ruined my mood to read that	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	19	yeah me too, it was honestly hard to read.  I don't like to hear about suffering like that.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	2	Yes imagine having that cold of a heart to do this? So disgusting.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	20	agreed. hope they find the culprits soon.	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	21	So do I.  it didn't sound like they have any leads though.	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	22	yeah which is why i doubt they will	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	23	yeah, you are probably right.  the person will just be free to strike again.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	24	it was a great talk overall. bye	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	25	same to you, bye	0.0	2.0	0.6667	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	3	Yeah, an extremely sick and depraved person.  Seriously must be a serial killer, no doubt.	2.0	4.0	3.0	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	4	seriously must be someone with issues beyond belief.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	5	yeah, who needs to be put away.  that is outrageous.  the poor little kitten!!!	2.0	4.6667	4.0	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	6	imagine the pain!?!?	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	7	Right?!  And how helpless it is.  Just unbelievable, ugh I can't even think abut it.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
454	8	exactly. its crazy some of these people live among us.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	182.0	19.0	453.0
454	9	It really is, I can't even imagine the mindset of a person like that.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	182.0	24.0	953.0
457	0	Wow. So what did you think?	1.0	3.0	1.0	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	1	cops are out of control	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	10	It's a messed up system from every angle.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	11	sure is and forget about the justice system its their to extract money from people the whole thing is disgusting	2.0	4.0	2.6667	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	12	Oh yeah. The fact that for-profit prisons exist is just a monumentally terrible idea.	1.6667	3.6667	2.3333	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	13	the only reason people haven't revolted yet is because they have been so dumbed down they can only focus on instagram and big butts	1.6667	3.6667	1.3333	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	14	that and when you're working near 24/7 just to keep your family above water, it's hard to focus on anything else.	1.6667	3.6667	3.0	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	15	exactly that is by design they want TV and the internet to raise the kids	1.0	3.3333	1.6667	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	16	Anything that keeps money lining the pockets of the wealthy.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	17	its sick the whole thing is set up against us but I guess all we can do is focus on our own families and hope for the bes	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	18	Yeah. Work on so many of the little things they become big things, as it were.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	19	yep nice chattiing with you bye	0.6667	2.3333	0.6667	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	2	Agreed. I'm so glad we're getting more footage of arrests these days.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	20	bye!	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	3	and that's still not even half the stuff	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	4	Yeah. It's just galling about how much they'll lie about and cover up, even when it's so blatant.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	5	and the laws are set up to protect them	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	6	Mmhm. It boggles my mind that police don't have to do more training about what is and isn't legal. Like, they only have one intro class on law.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	7	if you have a high IQ they won't take you	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
457	8	For real??	1.0	3.0	2.0	1	371.0	13.0	456.0
457	9	yes they hire the dumbest jocks from high school full of human growth hormone and rage because no one gives a shit about them anymore	2.0	3.6667	2.0	2	371.0	33.0	956.0
458	0	How do you feel about cops punching women?	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	1	I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?	2.0	3.3333	0.6667	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	10	Imagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	11	Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neck	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	12	Yeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person.	1.6667	4.3333	1.6667	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	13	Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	14	Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science.	1.0	4.0	1.6667	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	15	Same here, I've been annoyed before but I've always been treated fairly and with decent courtesy.	1.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	16	Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	17	Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid.	1.3333	4.3333	1.3333	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	18	Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful.	2.0	4.0	1.3333	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	19	Yep, we sure do.  You said it better than I.  Well I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	2	I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop.	1.3333	3.3333	1.3333	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	20	Yeah, have a great day.  Nice chatting with you.  goodbye	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	3	Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this.	1.6667	3.6667	1.3333	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	4	"That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  ""Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?""  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety."	1.6667	4.3333	1.3333	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	5	Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.	1.0	3.6667	1.3333	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	6	Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.	1.0	4.3333	1.3333	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	7	"Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the ""victim"" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problems"	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
458	8	Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	371.0	48.0	457.0
458	9	yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of others	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	2	371.0	24.0	957.0
460	0	hey what did you think	1.0	0.6667	0.6667	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	1	i think cops need to be better trained!	1.3333	3.0	3.0	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
460	10	Should be more resources to them so unfair	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	11	its like the government thinks of them as robots who dont snap under all the pressure	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
460	12	crazy because so many do in the news think things would change	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	13	yeah hopefully they wake up soon enough	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	371.0	19.0	959.0

460	3	yeah pretty crazy how this hasnt changed	1.0	2.6667	3.0	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
460	4	I agree this was just out of anger	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	5	yeah someone needs to give therapy to these cops so they dont let their anger out on civilians	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
460	6	I agree some kind of work counseling	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	7	yeah a lot of jobs have that cant believe cops of all jobs dont	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
460	8	I agree like the suicide rate among them is going up	1.3333	1.6667	3.0	1	371.0	53.0	459.0
460	9	yeah a lot of pressure and danger they face every single day	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	371.0	19.0	959.0
461	0	Hello what did you think about the article?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	1	it is scary what a miscommunication can lead to!	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	10	I hope no children were harmed.	1.6667	3.3333	3.0	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	11	me two but it probably did so sad	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	12	Yeah, i read an article about babies being killed this morning, it was so sad	2.0	4.3333	4.0	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	13	wow thats so sad there just innocent victims	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	14	Yes, poor things. Well it was nice talking to you, bye	0.6667	2.6667	4.0	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	15	oh i think we need to each do ten turns before leaving, what are your thoughts about syria driving all this	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	16	Oh sorry about that, i think this is the last turn. I think Syria should really try to improve relations with other countries to prevent more deaths.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	17	I agree they need to come to peace to help promote a better life for there citizens and ones pf areas around them.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	18	Yup, let's hope everything goes well for them in the future. bye!	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	19	I agree bye!	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	2	I agree. I feel so bad for these soldiers.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	3	on both sides me two	1.6667	2.6667	4.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	4	The fact that they have families at home just makes it worse!	2.0	3.6667	4.6667	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	5	I agree what a silly way for them to die so preventable	2.0	3.0	3.6667	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	6	It's just sad that there are still wars going on and people are dying. We should be better than that.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	7	i agree but it is complicated	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
461	8	IT is but people shouldn't be killing one another	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	18.0	17.0	460.0
461	9	true but it must be scary when bombers are randomly popping up	2.0	3.0	3.3333	2	18.0	53.0	960.0
463	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	1	i thought it was an accident after reading the article through. what about you?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	10	yeah, like you would think one would have said something	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	11	makes you wonder if they knew but didnt stop on purpose	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	12	yeah, but why?  just to be defiant?  rogue?  suicidal??	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	13	im thinking they were probably rogue	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	14	Yeah that would probably make the most sense	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	15	hopefully things become clearer	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	16	yes, the article didn't give much resolution	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	17	wish they cleared things up more at the end of the article	1.0	2.0	1.6667	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	18	me too.  I was left feeling confused.  Well it has been a great talk, goodbye	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	19	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	2	Yes, I thought so too, like a misunderstanding gone terribly wrong	1.6667	3.0	3.0	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	3	yeah unfortunately maybe the military trainers didn't see or realize they had  to stop the vehicle.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	4	Yeah, they probably need to review protocol and make sure everyone is really clear going forward	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	5	yeah i wonder why they didnt realize they had to stop though. you would think they go through extensive training	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	6	yeah you would think, maybe some sort of oversight?  Quite a serious one.	1.3333	2.0	2.3333	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	7	yeah or maps detailing stops and all of that	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
463	8	Yeah seriously, you would think they would have known.  there were also three of them	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	18.0	24.0	462.0
463	9	thats crazy..	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	2	18.0	19.0	962.0
464	0	Do you think it is more to the story of the shootout?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	1	perhaps could be a coverup but honestly we need to bring all our troops home	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	10	lol you don't paint a bright future.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	11	its not bright but its better to anticipate chaos then get caught with your pants down	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	12	I agree with that, but it is only some much you can plan.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	13	true but I bought a farm and livestock chickens and I grew up in the ghetto with barely any trees	0.6667	1.6667	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	14	Your one of the few that have a farm and livestock 99.9 can not hunt or grow food.	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	15	I know trust me I didn't know anything about farming or hunting I just learned took me a few years but now I chop my own firewood for my wood burning stove anyone can learn anything now with the internet	0.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	16	Yeah, I learned from my grandmother how to plan my own crops.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	17	thats great the older generations really had a lot of practical knowledge and grit	0.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	18	Yeah she came from a hardworking generation	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	19	now the youth don't even know how to change a tire	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	2	I agree with that.	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	20	Yeah, but car companies are making it harder to even change a head light.	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	21	yea I had to youtube it when I changed mine nice chatting with you bye	0.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	22	you too bye	0.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	3	yea we spend billions on policing the world while there are places in america that look like a third world slum	1.3333	3.0	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	4	I agree with that too. We should fix America first.	0.6667	2.6667	2.0	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	5	exactly use the troops to protect our borders and defend against any attack on the homeland we wouldn't have an immigration problem or a need for a wall if we used our troops the way the founding fathers envisioned	1.3333	3.6667	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	6	I would take that better than spending billions on a wall.	0.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	7	i know useless wall won't solve anything they can build tunnels	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
464	8	How much longer do you realistically think we will keep troops in the middle east?	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	18.0	30.0	463.0
464	9	as long as the  dollar is the reserve currency for oil which will end soon but that also means the economic collapse of this country also long overdue	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	18.0	33.0	963.0
465	0	Seems like a tragic accident or misunderstanding.	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	1	Yea that is what it seems like, not exactly sure how that happened but its sad that it had to escalate to that	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	10	Wow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	11	Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates. I have 2 sons and would never let them join the army, so much mental illness in the military unfortunately.	2.0	4.3333	4.0	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	12	Yes, there's definitely a lot of that, unfortunately.  Although I've also known a lot of people who were in the military who got a ton out of it and are thankful for their time in.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	13	Really? I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the military	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	14	It definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	15	What's the difference?	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	16	Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types.	0.6667	1.6667	3.0	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	17	Oh gotcha, I've known 2 people from the air force that did well afterwards and 1 guy from the marines that had a really hard go afterwards... but def different personality types	1.0	2.6667	2.0	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	18	"Yeah, I could certainly see that.  Air Force and Navy are sort of more ""office jobs"" and skilled professions (like mechanics).  Marines and Army are a lot more ""military military"" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately."	1.3333	3.0	3.6667	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	19	Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to have	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	2	Definitely.  I can't imagine what was going through the minds of the Americans not stopping at the gate.	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	20	That's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  bye	1.3333	3.6667	2.3333	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	21	haha bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	3	Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \	1.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	4	It seems more tragic when soldiers die from friendly fire, but I guess the result is the same.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	5	Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train them	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	6	The families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	7	Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prison	2.0	4.0	3.3333	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
465	8	Wow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?	0.6667	2.6667	3.6667	1	18.0	48.0	464.0
465	9	The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselves	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	18.0	50.0	964.0
466	0	What did you think of the article?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	1	I thought it was funny that the Jews were upset I think they really don't care who wins the election as long as Israel gets that money	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	10	Same here, conservative rural area.  I couldn't stand living in a big city.	1.0	2.6667	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	11	I grew up in the city and got the hell out first chance i got	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	12	I do not blame you.  I grew up in a mid-sized city and it was bad enough, we've been so much happier since we moved out here.	1.3333	3.0	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	13	yep got a little fixer upper with 6 acres now I have my livestock and chickens	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	14	Wow, that is great!  I would love to have livestock but that is so much work.  IA lot of our neighbors do.  I have four children and a fifth on the way so they keep me busy.  Anyway, back to the article, in general it just irritated me.	0.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	15	wow you went for the fifth! I have four my oldest just turned 6	0.6667	3.0	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	16	You must stay extremely busy!  :)  Yeah, my oldest is 14 and youngest is 7 months, they'll be almost exactly 1 year apart.	0.3333	2.6667	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	17	Its a mad house but i wouldn't change it for the world lol	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	18	I totally hear you!!  my three youngest are under 3.  It is definitely much, much better raising them out here, I can't imagine trying to raise a family in a city around all this nonsense.  no way.	1.0	3.3333	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	19	Forget it my parents still live in the city and it bugs me out everytime I visit them well it was nice chatting with you bye!	0.6667	3.0	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	2	Everyone loves to blame Trump for everything.  There have been hate crimes against Jews since the beginning of time.  That is nothing new.	1.3333	3.0	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	20	I bet so!!  you too, have a great day, bye!	0.0	2.6667	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	3	I know they secretly love Trump though they won't admit it through the media networks that they own	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	4	The polls spoke for themselves.  Jewish people supported Trump more than they have other Republican candidates in the past.  Really, it's articles like this that perpetuate this whole finger pointing deal towards Trump.  It's stupid.	1.3333	3.3333	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	5	Exactly Trump has done more for Israel then any other I mean we all know America is basically run by Israel but now its so much more open with it	1.0	3.0	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	6	Seriously, people always fail to recognize these things.  Probably because they just read CNN and disregard actual facts.  Oh well, what can you do	1.0	2.6667	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	7	you can only educate yourself you cant change anyones mind you can only make them think	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
466	8	Yep, that is very very true.  Pretty much everyone I know feels the same way I do though so there's no one's mind to change	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	326.0	24.0	465.0
466	9	yea me too I live in a rural place not the city cesspools	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	326.0	33.0	965.0
467	0	How did this article make you feel?	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	1	I was surprised because I did not know the Jewish community felt like that and you?	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	10	The thing is though that I don't think Trump himself has ever done anything anti-semitic.  Certainly people who voted for him have.	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	11	Trump does not really distance himself from the alt right.	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	12	Maybe, but I don't think his message exactly gets through when it's filtered through the media.  I thought Trump's response to Charlottesville, for example, was the correct one.  Both sides were at fault.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	13	I disagree but we are all entitled to our opinions.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	14	Yes, you're allowed to be wrong.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	15	lol your entitled to think that.	0.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	16	"You spelled ""you're"" wrong.  But you're entitled to be wrong, as I said."	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	17	you got me!	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	18	Yeah, it wasn't hard.  Any other thoughts on this article?  Do you think our democracy is being threatened by a Presidential election?	1.0	3.0	1.3333	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	19	Yes, our Presidential election is being threaten because republicans are allowing it to be.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	2	Not really.  I'd be interested to know how they feel about Trump now seeing as he's been such a pro-Israel President.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	20	I'm not sure what you mean.	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	21	The republicans are blocking bills that now allow other countries to mess with our elections which threatens our democracy.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	22	I think you're confused about a lot of what's going on.	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	23	Your opinion, it was nice chatting with you. bye	0.3333	2.0	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	24	Yeah, it's always nice chatting with someone who's mentally retarded.  bye	1.6667	5.0	1.3333	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	3	That is a good question.	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	4	I'm part Jewish but have never had that much connection to Jews or understanding of their feelings on their place in our society.	0.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	5	why not?	1.0	1.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	6	It's just  not a big part of my family tree.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	7	I think the holocaust put the Jewish community on edge.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
467	8	Yeah, sort of like slavery for blacks. Now everything gets viewed through that prism.  Jewish history has plenty of persecution before that too.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	466.0
467	9	The article also said some Jewish people voted for Trump.	1.0	1.0	2.6667	2	326.0	30.0	966.0
468	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	1	I was able to understand the Jewish people and why they were angry. You	0.6667	1.6667	3.3333	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	10	Do you support the current President?	0.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	11	I don't. I disagree with his views and the way he is overall. You?	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	12	same. I don't think hes even a decent president	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	13	Do you have a nominee in mind for next election? I have been interested in Andrew Yang.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	14	I like Yang for his policies.	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	15	Same! The UBI is nice too. But back to this, i hope things get better for the Jewish people in the future	0.6667	2.6667	3.6667	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	16	Yeah, it starts with getting the current president impeached soon.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	17	Let's hope it happens!	0.0	3.3333	3.0	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	18	Agree!	0.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	19	Well it was nice talking to you! Let's hope for a better future for everyone. bye	0.3333	2.6667	2.3333	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	2	Yeah, I can definitely see why they were angry	0.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	20	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	3	They're probably still thinking about what happened back the nand the history.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	4	Yeah a lot of them survived nazi Germany and know firsthand	0.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	5	Definitely. I wonder which president Jewish people are supporting in the upcoming election	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	6	most likely on the blue side	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	7	I agree. Do you know any Jewish people?	0.6667	1.0	1.6667	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
468	8	i know a few but not much, you?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	326.0	19.0	467.0
468	9	I don't know any at all. I wish i did so i can ask them about this situation	0.6667	2.0	2.6667	2	326.0	17.0	967.0
470	0	What did you feel about the article?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	1	To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politics	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	10	Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	11	Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	12	Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care.	2.0	4.0	2.6667	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	13	Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	14	Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	15	Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities.	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	16	I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now.	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	17	Young people live their life online - every moment documented - it portrays a life that don't live and hurts those that are absent from their postings.   It will be interesting to see it either shift away or continue its destructive path	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	18	Yes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.  Always nice talking with reasonable, thoughtful people.  Have a great day.  bye	1.6667	3.3333	1.3333	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	19	It is an addiction.   Apple, Steve Jobs, would not even give his kids a phone because he knew the damage it would cause in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain as well as its addictive qualities.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	2	Yes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	20	Yeah, that should certainly tell you something.  (Although he was willing to unleash it on the world.)  Anyway, good chatting again.  bye	1.0	2.3333	1.6667	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	21	goodbye	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	3	It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all.	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	4	Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.  And it's because of how we communicate and interact with each other, not some fundamentally new divide in ideology or something.	2.0	2.6667	3.0	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	5	Exactly.  I honestly wish social media was never born.	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	6	Yeah, it's pretty awful.  I don't use it (although I'm so asocial in wouldn't do anything for me anyway).  But I think it's interesting because everyone seems to be coming to the same conclusion that it's bad, but they can't stop themselves from using it nonetheless.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	7	Agreed.   All these little 10 year olds committing suicide because of social media.   They shouldn't even be on social media.   It's so sad	2.0	4.3333	3.0	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
470	8	Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade.	1.6667	3.3333	2.0	1	326.0	48.0	469.0
470	9	Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	326.0	8.0	969.0
472	0	hey what did you think about what we read	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	1	It sounded like a bit of a scary experience for the people on the train.	1.6667	3.0	3.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	10	no thank god we dont really have trains around here	0.0	3.0	1.6667	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	11	I haven't either, though one time I was on a city bus and it took a turn too sharp and hit a light pole. It was the most boring accident ever.	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	12	wow haha thats just silly i guess it was like that but way faster !	1.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	13	Another bus came and everyone just transferred over like nothing happened.	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	14	well that sounds like an easy fix lucky	0.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	15	Yep. Trains are weird things though, with the tracks and all. It seems like things have to be pretty exact for everything to go smoothly.	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	16	yeah there pretty routine i wonder if they will investigate more	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	17	I'm sure they probably will. They probably need the investigation for insurance purposes.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	18	oh that is true need to stop the pattern of it happening	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	19	Really, I think trains are one of the safer ways to travel. I don't know the exact statistics right now, but I think they were right after planes in safeness.	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	2	yeah i couldnt imagine having my train sway	1.3333	3.0	3.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	20	i can see that maybe the technology just needs to be updated	0.6667	2.0	1.0	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	21	Maybe convert them all to MagLev trains. I haven't heard anything about those crashing.	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	22	i have never heard of those thats interesting	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	23	They kind of float on magnets, so there's very little friction. I think there's a high speed MagLev train in Japan, but I could be wrong. I know it's high speed but I'm not sure of the type.	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	24	that would seem scary to me high speed haha	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	25	Just looked it up. 375 mph.	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	26	wow that is fast crazy that thats safer but i can see it	0.6667	3.3333	1.0	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	27	The wikipedia article on Japan's high speed trains says there has never been a fatality.	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	28	wow definitly need to look into switching into that technology	0.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	29	It would take a large investment to switch, but I think it would be worth it.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	3	I wish they knew what caused it. The article said it may have hit the edge of a bridge? How does that even happen?	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	30	same here! it has been great talking to you! bye	0.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	31	bye!	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	4	exactly sounds like no safety measures or inspections are done	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	5	It seems like there should be more procedures in place for checking transportation safety. Maybe just a safety train that runs the track once a day to check there aren't any bridges sticking out.	0.6667	3.0	2.0	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	6	i agree something this is the second huge crash	1.3333	2.6667	2.3333	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	7	It makes me a bit apprehensive about taking transit like that, and I was already a little wary of it.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
472	8	same with little control of the outcome	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	297.0	53.0	471.0
472	9	Have you ever been involved in a transportation accident like that?	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	297.0	21.0	971.0
473	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	1	It was sad time all the people that was lost	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	10	yeah its sad	2.0	3.0	3.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	11	Humans is slowly killing each other this way.One day they be just robots doing these train jobs even know they can screw up but not this badly i don't think.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	12	robots should do a better job hopefully	0.0	2.0	1.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	13	Yes can't be any worse then what us human do. Sucks jobs will be lost but if it brings better safety i will take it.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	14	lives will be saved which is great imo	0.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	15	Yeah till we decide to destory robots then they try to kill us lol	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	16	lol man thats crazy to think about	1.3333	3.0	1.0	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	17	Yeah but it's always possible look at what happen to area 51 all them people actually went. I wasn't excepting that but they failed lol they was like 20miles from the gate.	1.3333	2.6667	1.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	18	did those people even go in? or were they just at the entrance of area 51	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	19	I read they went but acting like clowns. But i heard the real gate to 51 after the first gate is 20miles pretty sure no one going run for 20miles to get shredded.	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	2	yeah its the same spot a crash happened in 2013 as well.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	20	imagine actually rushing in area 51 lol. expect bullets on every inch of your body	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	21	All they need is just a tank and before the people get there they go flying into the air one tank is enough no need to waste bullets	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	22	its been a good talk. bye	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	23	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	3	I didn't know that what was that crash about	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	4	at least only four died couldve been worse	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	5	yeah i hate stories like this such a tragic event to lose someone.	2.0	3.3333	4.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	6	I always wonder though if someone was inept at their job when these things happen	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	7	I know i heard one crash happen cause the train conduter was under the influence of drugs. I just wish people could not do that with other peoples lives.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
473	8	I remember about a train crash in Japan where the driver was just so scared of losing his job because his bosses were so strict and yelled at them for anything that he lost control of a train and many people died.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	297.0	19.0	472.0
473	9	Wow that crazy i know we all love our jobs but these bosses should be fired they killed lots of people doing this.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	297.0	54.0	972.0
474	0	I know that trains are safe to travel in, but this makes me pause.	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	1	I seem to hear more stories about train crashes than I do about plane crashes. It seems strange to me.	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	10	DOA. She died along with her cousin and another friend. The other driver had a heart attack and ran the red light.	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	11	My goodness. What a tragedy. My condolences.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	12	Thank you. I get why people are not emphatic for everything. We're overloaded with news.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	13	Not only that, but when one is totally helpless to affect a more positive outcome the empathy can often seem misplaced or disingenuous.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	14	True. I do wish people valued life more.	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	15	People, especially people in developed nations often take it for granted because they don't realize how quickly it can be taken away.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	16	These articles have been making me do some soul searching. It was nice talking with you! bye.	0.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	17	Back at you, but I think we're only up to nine. bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.6667	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	2	I wouldn't want to be in either one.	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	3	No, but I think a train crash would have a higher survival rate depending on the circumstances.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	4	If I had to pick one, it would definitely be the train crash.	1.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	5	Do you have much empathy for the victims of the crash? I mean, as much as one person can for a tragedy at a distance?	1.0	2.0	0.3333	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	6	Yes, any lost of life is bad. How about you?	1.6667	2.3333	3.6667	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	7	I do, but it wasn't a particularly emotional article. I mean, I'm not going to lost any sleep over it or anything. Have you ever lost a loved one in an accident?	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
474	8	One of my best friends died in a car accident.	2.0	3.0	2.6667	1	297.0	30.0	473.0
474	9	I'm sorry to hear that. We're they DOA or did they receive treatment at a hospital?	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	297.0	25.0	973.0
475	0	What a tragedy!	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	1	Yes, it seems like it would be terrifying to be in a train derailment.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	10	Yes I think the underground aspect gives me a bit of claustrophobia. My city doesnt have subways so it isnt something Im accustomed to.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	11	Gotcha.  I can definitely see that.  They're also usually very dark and often extremely crowded.  I rode one to work for a few years.  Wasn't the best part of my day.	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	12	Since trains appear so safe, I would say the victims of this crash were not even expecting anything to go wrong.	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	13	Yeah, I'm sure it was totally out of the blue.  Even though planes are safe, I think you always have in the back of your mind that at any time something could go terrible wrong in the air.  But a train?  It's gotta be unexpected.	2.0	2.6667	4.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	14	Very much so. I hope they were able to work out whatever issues led to this crash.	0.6667	2.3333	2.0	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	15	Yeah, I'm sure they do a thorough evaluation and fix whatever was wrong.  Europe uses trains a lot more than we do, I think.  They can't afford to let things get into disrepair.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	16	It is a tragedy for sure	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	17	Let's hope it doesn't happen too frequently in the future.	1.0	2.6667	1.6667	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	18	it was great chatting with you today	0.3333	2.3333	1.0	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	19	Yes, nice chatting with you too.	0.0	2.3333	1.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	2	Yes no doubt. And I feel terrible for the victims' families	2.0	3.6667	5.0	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	20	goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	21	goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	3	For sure.  I always think of trains as very safe modes of transportation.  It would be shocking to hear a loved one died on a train.	1.6667	3.3333	3.6667	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	4	I know, theyre regarded as being so safe and then somethig like the happens unexpectedly.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	5	I'm always puzzled about how derailments can occur.  Do the trains go too fast or are the tracks damaged or something?  I never understand it.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	6	I would think that the tracks would be better maintained. But I guess you cant plan for every possible problem	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	7	Have you ever been on a long train ride?  I've only ever been on subways and light rail.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
475	8	I have not. Just subways for me. They scare me more than a train would.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	297.0	43.0	474.0
475	9	haha! What it is about the subway that scares you?  Being underground?	1.6667	3.0	1.0	2	297.0	48.0	974.0
476	0	Hi there, how are you today?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	1	im doing great! what did you think about what we read?	0.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	10	"I sometimes buy too much food at CostCo because it's ""such a great deal"". Then I throw away much more than I want to."	1.3333	2.6667	3.3333	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	11	yeah i am guilty when theres a sale and then end up not using it before it goes bad	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	12	I can't believe some of the statistics from that article though. It's shocking that so many people don't think it's a problem.	2.0	3.3333	3.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	13	ive seen more ads on tv maybe that will bring more awareness	0.6667	2.3333	3.3333	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	14	Really? I haven't seen any yet. That would be great if it does.  There's a company, I forget the name but a friend of mine gets her food from them, that sells food that is slightly out of date but is still highly edible.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	15	theres also one that sells people the not perfect produce from stores	1.3333	2.0	2.6667	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	16	Maybe that's the same one. I need to talk to her about it.	1.0	1.6667	2.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	17	oh okay that is a great service you get them cheaper and less waste	0.3333	2.3333	2.6667	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	18	Do you use it?	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	19	no but ive seen youtubers use it alot	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	2	I think it's really sad. People just don't try very hard to not waste food. Don't you think?	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	20	I hope that reading this article will get me to buy less produce at CostCo even when it's on sale.	0.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	21	yeah or try and freeze some maybe	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	22	If I had a bigger freezer I would do that. I might just try and get two fruits at a time.	1.0	1.6667	2.6667	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	23	yeah great idea would save you by not paying for things you wont eat	0.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	24	I could always just go to a local supermarket if I really wanted a fruit and not waste so much, you know?	1.3333	1.6667	2.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	25	yes i agree. its been nice chatting!	0.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	26	I didn't know that there were YouTubers that talked about this a lot. Do you watch many food channels?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	27	yes some just for recipe ideas	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	28	One last thing. Do you think the article will make you talk about this with others more?	1.3333	2.0	0.6667	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	29	i think so i want to inform people of what a problem this is	1.3333	2.0	3.0	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	3	yeah i think alot of people dont really think about it	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	53.0	53.0	975.0

476	4	I know that I'm guilty sometimes of wasting food. How about you?	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0
476	5	same here it was only recently i found out the difference between expiration and use by date	1.6667	1.6667	2.6667	2	53.0	53.0	975.0
476	6	Do you ever shop at CostCo or BJ's?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	53.0	9.0	475.0

477	1	Hello, I do not find it shocking, when I go grocery shopping I find it kind of insane with how much food people have in their carts like no way they can eat it all	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	2	53.0	50.0	976.0
477	10	True! What kind of food do you cook the most?	1.0	2.0	0.6667	1	53.0	17.0	476.0
477	11	I try to switch it up but I make steak, fish, quesadillas, chili, grilled chicken and then have to make a separate meal for my picky eaters	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	53.0	50.0	976.0
477	12	That sounds delicious. I wish i knew how to make that	0.0	2.0	0.6667	1	53.0	17.0	476.0
477	13	Which thing? What do you usually cook	1.0	1.3333	1.0	2	53.0	50.0	976.0

477	2	I agree, i am guilty of it myself to be honest	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	53.0	17.0	476.0
477	3	I am pretty good with sticking to my recipes and my list but I have a problem with produce since it seems to go bad a lot of the time before we have time to eat it	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	53.0	50.0	976.0
477	4	Do you just throw it away then?	1.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	53.0	17.0	476.0
477	5	I try to cut off the bad pieces but sometimes its not salvageable	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	53.0	50.0	976.0
477	6	Nice, i usually just turn it into a shake of some sort!	0.0	2.0	1.3333	1	53.0	17.0	476.0
477	7	Thats a good idea, my neighbor has a little compost that she uses for a garden which is cool. What type of food do you waste the most of	0.0	2.0	1.3333	2	53.0	50.0	976.0

477	9	Yea I have a problem with wasting pasta, i guess people need to be more conscious of when they think they are making too much of something	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	53.0	50.0	976.0
479	0	what did you think about the article?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	53.0	19.0	478.0
479	1	I think that a full belly is taken for granted in our country. You?	0.6667	2.6667	4.0	2	53.0	25.0	978.0

479	13	How do you feel about food waste coming from grocery stores, restaurants and the like? Is there a practical way to cut down on the immense amount that they contribute?	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	53.0	25.0	978.0
479	14	probably give some of the extra food away to people in need	1.3333	1.6667	3.3333	1	53.0	19.0	478.0
479	15	That's a good one. I'm sure some places have programs like that in place.	0.0	2.0	3.0	2	53.0	25.0	978.0

479	18	if im hungry and cant afford actual food why not. what about you	1.3333	2.0	3.0	1	53.0	19.0	478.0

479	20	bye	0.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	53.0	19.0	478.0
479	3	Only if it starts to mold and cutting off the moldy section wouldn't save it. How about you?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	2	53.0	25.0	978.0
479	4	yep i usually throw out bread which molds so quick	1.0	1.6667	3.0	1	53.0	19.0	478.0

479	9	I go once a week and try to only buy things to last me for that week. I actually end up throwing out fresh spices like cilantro/thyme/etc because I haven't found a way to properly store it.	0.3333	2.0	3.6667	2	53.0	25.0	978.0
480	0	I cannot begin to understand how this much food is wasted each year.	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	1	I know what you mean. I know that I could do better on my part.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	10	I wish that was an option where I live.	1.0	2.6667	3.0	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	11	Why can't you have one?	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	53.0	30.0	979.0

480	13	LOL. I could never live in a HOA.	1.3333	3.3333	1.6667	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	14	Unfortunately where I am, almost all properties are in an HOA or the ghetto. I would like to move out of county and get some land and grow my own food, compost, all of that fun stuff.	1.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	15	I just wouldn't like people telling me what to do with my house.	1.3333	2.6667	2.6667	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	16	Yeah that is a definite downside to it.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	17	So you can't even have a garden?	1.3333	2.3333	3.0	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	18	Only flowers. I do hope that the food waste problem can be resolved to some extent in the near future though.	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	19	Me too. It was very nice chatting with you! bye	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	2	It really makes me want to do more to reduce waste	0.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	20	You too. Goodbye	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	3	Yeah, I have a large family so it hard somethings to control waste.	1.6667	2.0	3.0	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	4	I think even a small effort on everyone's part would make some impact on overall waste	0.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	5	I'm surprised that saving money they not motivate more people.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	6	I think on a corporate level, there should be more donation of these unused foods, rather than them all going to waste.	1.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	7	I have seen restaurants and stores give away food to the homeless instead of throwing it out.	0.6667	2.0	2.3333	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
480	8	That seems like a great idea	0.6667	2.6667	2.6667	1	53.0	43.0	479.0
480	9	I also try to compose some of my food waste.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	53.0	30.0	979.0
481	0	Every time I read about another shooting I get a bit on edge.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	1	I feellike ive become so desensitized its just every month now	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	10	I live in the suburbs, so you don't really see that kind of thing here.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	11	I am on the borderline so I know from the news those things happen alot	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	12	I've only really started seeing so many stories like this in the last few years probably because of social media.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	13	oh okay Ive sadly grown up with columbine, sandy hook then so on every year I wish more mental health was available to the people and kids doing this	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	14	When I was growing up this kind of things was only once every few years instead of few weeks.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	15	wow that sounds like a way better time to live in	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	16	I guess everything seems simpler and safer when you're little.	0.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	17	I agree your shielded from the bad stuff	0.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	18	I wonder if he was trying to make a political statement because it happened near a polling place.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	19	Me two they said it didnt have to do with the election but it was near there and he was hispanic	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	2	It doesn't have the same impact anymore, which is sad.	2.0	2.6667	1.6667	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	20	I think thats 10 turns each now. Nice to talk to you. goodbye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	21	you two bye	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	3	it is very sad I think we need to take a look at fixing other aspects then availability of guns	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	4	At least there weren't too many people hurt this time.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	5	true just the guy with the gun which is good I guess	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	6	I wonder how he got his assault rifle.	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	7	Me two he was pretty old I wonder if it was his for a while	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
481	8	It's not like you can just walk into Walmart and buy an assault rifle.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	42.0	480.0
481	9	Yeah true but you can walk the street in my city and buy one its crazy	1.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	53.0	980.0
482	0	That was a short and strange article. What do you think?	2.0	2.0	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	1	very tragic	2.0	3.0	2.6667	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	10	I don't think that we will ever lose guns.	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	11	people will start a civil war if they ever try	1.3333	3.6667	1.3333	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	12	I can see that happening.	1.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	13	so while Trump in in the house, guns are safe	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	14	I agree with that.	1.0	2.0	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	15	it's the annoying fake news that pump people full of crazy ideas on TV	1.6667	4.0	1.0	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	16	I don't really watch TV.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	17	"same here, just to check the local weather and make sure there is no ""Armageddon"" before I head out the door, too stressful"	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	18	Yeah, too much overload.	1.3333	2.0	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	19	there's plenty of good sources on the net to get the truth and even then you have to filter things out	1.3333	3.0	1.0	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	2	It didn't give much context.	1.3333	1.3333	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	20	I don't think there should be a ban on assault weapons.	0.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	21	I feel the same, gun rights are people's rights as long as everything is legal and there is a background check and registration	1.0	3.0	1.3333	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	22	It was nice chatting with you bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	23	same here, thank you and goodbye	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	3	not at all, the lunatic, however, should have been taken out right then and there if someone had a gun	2.0	4.0	1.6667	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	4	I agree with that.	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	5	"and we still debate ""gun rights""-before the glorious police force arrives everyone will be dead. In this case, a 70-year-old was taken out. Nobody deserves to die like that."	2.0	4.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	6	I agree that it is a right to have a gun, but I also want background checks.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	7	I agree with checks, but as you know they don;t stop the real criminals, look at Chicago metro area  or New York-teaming with guns even though it is illegal.That's why people need to be able to protect themselves.	1.0	3.0	1.6667	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
482	8	I think the tooth paste is already out of the tube as far as the guns that are already out there.	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	481.0
482	9	Yes, I agree. But at least in the US we have guns and I don;t think that will ever change, God forbid we'll end up like Europe-completely defenseless!	1.0	4.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	26.0	981.0
483	0	Do you think people should kill themselves?	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	1	I would prefer that people not feel the need to kill themselves.  That would be my hope for people.  How about you?	1.3333	3.3333	2.6667	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	10	 He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence.	1.6667	1.0	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	11	I'll have to go back and read about him.  Seems strange that he thought he could get away with doing that.  But maybe I don't remember the specifics of what he did and what the laws were.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	12	He tried to push the law for something he thought was right. I don't blame him, but I do understand why it is a complex issue.	0.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	13	Yeah, it's certainly a complicated issue.  And if I were in his situation I certainly wouldn't have thought I could get away with it, even if he just felt he was enabling others to commit suicide.  But obviously he felt more passionately about it than I do.	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	14	Have had it family members or friends that had a really prolonged illness?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	15	"Umm, yes and no, I guess.  Like, I've had family members waste away in hospital beds for years.  One with Alzheimer's.  But nothing where I thought, ""Man, this person needs to be put out of their misery.""  I've always thought life was misery.  But you stay 'til the credits."	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	16	I think when a person loses the joy of life and there is nothing but pain, it should be their choice.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	17	"I don't look down on people who commit suicide.  I understand the desire to die.  I don't think it's ""cowardly"" or anything like that.  Is it selfish?  Sure, but so is wanting people to continue to suffer for our own sake.  But I personally don't think the state should be encouraging it in any way."	0.6667	2.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	18	Not encouraging it, but not making it that they have to use a gun or hang themselves	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	19	"Yeah, I understand that side of it.  Give them a place to do it ""safely"" (a bit of a misnomer, but whatever).  But I still don't agree with the tacit validation of it.  Just my opinion."	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	2	I agree, but I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body.	0.3333	3.0	2.0	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	20	I do not fault you for your opinion. It is great to see how other people feel about different topics.	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	21	Yeah, I always find it interesting.  I think people actually have the same values; they just weigh them differently in different situations.  What we're talking about is largely a conflict between freedom and order (maybe not the best word for it, but I'll use it anyway).  I believe in freedom of choice.  So do you and everyone.  You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values.	1.6667	3.3333	1.6667	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	22	I can agree with that. It was very wonderful talking with you. Sorry about the typing brain farts, I have my daughter running around the room with an ear infection. bye	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	23	Sorry to hear about the ear infection.  Hope she feels better soon.  Nice talking with you, too.  Have a great day.  bye	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	3	Do you agree with doctor-assisted suicide?  Do you think that should be legal?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	4	100 percent agree with that. I have watched many family members suffer from cancer and lupus	1.0	2.6667	2.0	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	5	I believe it's now legal in Canada.  Do you think there will be a push in the U.S. (I assume you're in the U.S.) to legalize it here?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	6	Don't know, Canada is a head of the US on things like that and legal weed	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	7	Yes, they're certainly more progressive.  It's just not an issue we hear much about here.  Suicide talk nowadays tends to focus on young people, which has apparently spiked.	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
483	8	I grow up in Michigan and remember the big fuss over doctor Kevorkian	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	292.0	30.0	482.0
483	9	Yeah, I totally forgot about him.  I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall.	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	292.0	48.0	982.0
485	0	Well, this article was a little vague and confusing.	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	1	I thought that it was very vague. It doesn't even give a back story but i feel bad for hte police	1.6667	2.6667	3.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	10	On several occasions, but that hasn't negatively colored my perception of a group of people who, by and large, are just trying to do their job in a negative light. Of course, I have the privilege of being white.	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	11	That's good. You should like you have your head on straight and not influenced by others much	0.6667	1.6667	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	12	Being open to diverse viewpoints is critically important, but blindly swallowing and regurgitating the opinions of the group is dangerous. Do you have any feelings on the availability of semi-automatic rifles?	1.0	3.0	1.0	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	13	Hm i think that they should be harder to get ahold of. People thinking that taking away semi-auto rifles will automatically stop mass killings are dead wrong. People will always find other ways	1.3333	3.0	1.3333	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	14	I agree. I think that people are very quick to assign blame and knee jerk into a quick fix, but slow to address the roots of social problems that are driving the shooters to behave in such a violent manner.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	15	Yeah i suffer depression and anxiety myself and sometimes i feel like these people just need someone to talk to because they feel alone in the world. There was a recent video where a teacher stopped a shooter and began hugging him and the shooter started tearing up i believe. It was very sad.	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	16	Yeah, I actually saw that headline. The stark reality is that even though we are now all superficially tethered together by the world wide web, the world is more alienating and lonesome than ever before. This is done with purpose, because those feelings drive humans to consume in order to fill that void.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	17	Would you wish for a world that doesn't have social media at all? Or back to the old days with only instant messaging and texting.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	18	I don't participate in social media. When I was a kid I had a Myspace, but my involvement ended after that. Thus far I think that it has been a net negative for our society and I'm glad to have come up before it was so ubiquitous. How about you?	1.6667	2.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	19	I use it and seeing all these people flaunt their wealth does get to me. It makes you feel small . I believe this is the 10th turn. It was nice talking to you! Finally someone that answers and doesn't just type random things. Bye!	1.0	3.0	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	2	Why do you feel bad for the police?	1.0	1.6667	1.0	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	20	Nice talking to you also! bye	1.0	2.3333	1.0	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	21	bye	1.0	1.6667	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	3	I read the article a while ago, but didnt it mention a police getting killed?	1.0	1.6667	1.6667	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	4	No, the article I read only mentioned one 70 year old man and the shooter being dead. Then, it looped back around and said the shooter was still barricaded in his house at the end.	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	5	That's weird. Although mine did mention the shooter barricaded in the house. It was a weirdly worded article overall. Do you think the police are too aggressive?	1.0	2.3333	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	6	I think that police are trained to be aggressive in both speech and action, but only listening/watching media outlets will give you a very biased view of the situation. You?	1.3333	2.6667	1.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	7	I agree. There's definitely bad police out there but only the bad ones are shown on media outlets like you said. The other 80% don't get credit	2.0	3.0	1.6667	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
485	8	"I mean, I think there's something to be said for the so called ""good cops"" who are passively complicit in all the unethical shenanigans and miscarriages of justice that the others get into, but I don't think that turning the fantasy of us against them into a reality will pan out for either side."	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	292.0	25.0	484.0
485	9	Yeah, i've never had any bad experiences with police but then again, i never retaliate. Have you ever run into bad police?	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	292.0	17.0	984.0
486	0	Its crazy how you never truly know someone no matter how long you have been together	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	1	I know how could this type of thing happen!	1.6667	2.6667	2.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	10	I tell my husband, if you are unhappy, walk away. If I am no longer making you happy I wont stop you . I couldnt imagine him or I attacking each other and ending in murder/suicide.	1.6667	2.6667	3.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	11	Agreed, they should have had better communication and resolved things civilly if only she could have had resources to help her get away she probably felt trapped	1.6667	2.3333	3.6667	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	12	But I still do not understand the killing of the children. It makes no sense. They did nothing wrong	1.6667	3.6667	3.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	13	maybe he wanted them all to be together forever ind of thinking	0.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	14	Probally, or If I cant have you your mom cant either. You never know when it comes to these type of things	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	15	oh true ive seen other stories with that mindset	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	16	It reminds me of the recent killings where he killed his wife who was pregnant and 2 children but he claimed they went missing. while it wasnt a murder suicide, its the same mind set	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	17	oh i followed that it so was so especially the way he disposed of them like they were garbage chilling	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	18	How can you claim to love someone so much only to 1 murder them, and 2 treat them after death like they were nothing. the sign of a mental illness for sure	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	19	yes like your conscious is just turned off i dont now how that happens	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	2	I get lovers querl but when the children. I get mad at my kids but I could never ever in a million year ever think to physcially harm or mame or kill them.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	20	Theres no way you can claim that you had no control over yourself when you have to physically take the life from not 1 but 4 total ppl ( Mark short) its scary to think about because the person in the article shares the name of my kids principal	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	21	Oh my gosh really what a coincidence!	1.3333	3.3333	1.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	22	He doesnt have any kids but man I had to reread the name a few times. Its not a super common name.	1.6667	3.0	1.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	23	yeah that is very odd i would be worried two haha	1.0	2.6667	1.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	24	I have gotten to know him pretty well but  you never really know someone. Look at all the news with teachers having relations with students, ect. The person you think you know is just the person they want you to see.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	25	yup never now people until your behind closed doors	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	26	"Even behind closed doors, they have to let you in and ""trust"" you but you can still be fooled"	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	27	yeah people are narcassists and master manipulators to fool people	2.0	2.3333	1.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	28	I wish there was more to help those who need it	1.0	2.3333	3.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	29	me two ! well this was a great conversation thanks!	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	3	i think mental health makes you do crazy things tho	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	30	bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	4	Do you think the fact that you have to work basically 2 full time jobs to survive resulted in his mental health/	1.3333	2.6667	2.0	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	5	that plus the kids health issue just probably didnt take time to decompress	1.0	3.0	3.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	6	Its really hard when you have to be the rock and hold it together for everyone else but never ae allowed the chance to break down or have a repreieve	2.0	2.6667	3.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	7	I agree and she was so young when they married i think it was probable theyd grow apart	1.6667	2.6667	2.6667	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
486	8	I agree, as I am a result of a young marriage due to pregnancy that resulted in divorce, she was not allowed to live before having to grow up and being responsible for another person	2.0	3.0	2.3333	1	395.0	0.0	485.0
486	9	yes agreed it seems so much and then he was probably insecure and controlling as she was pretty and young they were not happy, cant believe it end in killing tho	2.0	2.3333	3.0	2	395.0	53.0	985.0
487	0	What a sad, sad story (:	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	1	I agree. I still think the dad was wrong.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	10	The interesting thing about this article is Facebook told a different story.  I feel like most of Facebook just wants to project look at me, look at me.	2.0	2.6667	2.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	11	I agree, I do not post good or bad things to social media. I like my life to be my life.	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	12	Agreed.   I worry about the first generation of our kids children.   Everything is on social media.   Worst thing that we have ever technologically done.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	13	Now people kill themselves over what strangers say in the comments.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	14	Yes they do.  We had a freshman in high school jump off a bridge because of horrendous bullying.   However, I feel like parents have a huge responsibility of monitoring all social media AND no child should have those accounts until high school	2.0	4.0	2.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	15	I would agree with that. I think children are exposed to a lot of concepts that at that age I had no clue about and was happy not having a clue about.	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	16	All kinds of studies indicate that their brains cannot process what is going on because their frontal cortex is not developed.   You can't unsee what you saw.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	17	I agree. I found it heart breaking that the child got a heart transport and had to die by a gunshot.	2.0	4.0	3.6667	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	18	I cannot think about that much.   It's very disturbing.  What were they thinking as they were being shot (:	2.0	4.3333	3.6667	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	19	I know this conversation is about empathy, I just can not put myself in the shoes of killing my family.	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	2	By the article, there was a great deal going on their lives, regardless of the Mom's PTSD with the little girl.   The entire household would be affected.   I just do not understand how things get so dark you would someone especially your family.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	20	Nor can I.   It has been great chatting with you today.   I hope your day is filled with joy.    goodbye	1.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	21	You too! bye	0.6667	2.0	1.0	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	3	I feel that it is a dad's job to protect his children and never to harm them. I feel sorry for all the things going on in their house, but that is no excuse for what he did.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	4	I totally agree.   If one of them had mental illness, the other should have insisted they get help or have them committed.	1.6667	3.0	2.6667	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	5	It has to be hard on the both families what happened.	1.6667	2.6667	3.6667	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	6	All the parents, grandparents, friends, etc.   I cannot imagine what they all feel.	2.0	4.0	4.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	7	Mark's family seemed really supportive.	0.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
487	8	They did.   My daughter has a lifelong friend whose husband is very mentally ill.   Her lifelong friend will not do what is the best for him.   My daughter is a psyc major.   Her fear is he will kill of them.   They have three little boys.  It just seems like everybody has their head in the sand.   Just like this story.	1.6667	3.6667	3.3333	1	395.0	8.0	486.0
487	9	Sorry to hear that.	2.0	2.0	2.3333	2	395.0	30.0	986.0
488	0	what a tragic story	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	1	yeah, it just goes to show that you can never really know what people are going through behind the scenes.	1.6667	2.0	4.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	10	I came across people like that in relationships and cut it off right away, luckily, have you?	1.0	2.0	1.6667	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	11	yes, actually. I went through a long period of rationalizing their behavior before I cut it off though.	2.0	2.6667	2.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	12	it's understandable-that's what abusers do, some of them are very charismatic and make us believe that they are angles and your're the problem	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	13	yep, plus lots of gas lighting. So, do you think the husband would have reacted differently if his wife had just stolen away with the kids?	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	14	maybe if she went to stay with a family and went away to a disclosed location, it would stop him from killing everyone-if he just wanted to take his life, fine, go ahead!	2.0	3.3333	2.3333	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	15	Do you think he was aware of her facebook posts?	1.0	1.3333	2.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	16	of course, it's all public, that probably ignited the fire even more, she should not have done it	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	17	yeah, I thought that was a mistake on her part. I can understand how trapped she must have felt though and needed to have her feelings validated.	1.6667	1.6667	3.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	18	she should have done it privately. however, damage is done and he stole his kids lives, tragic and pathetic	2.0	2.6667	2.6667	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	19	definitely, well thanks for chatting! bye	0.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	2	I feel extreme pity for the kids and wife but nothing but anger for the husband-he is a coward for taking his young kids' lives!	2.0	4.6667	4.3333	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	20	thank you bye	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	3	the dog too!	1.6667	3.6667	4.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	4	yes! He could have worked things out with some counseling. If his wife did not want to be with him he did not have to kill everybody!	2.0	4.0	3.6667	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	5	True, thinking of all the wasted potential is truly depressing. They didn't really go into detail about the domestic abuse, but someone doesn't just turn into a murderer over night.	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	6	I think the wife should have left him sooner, maybe the kids would still be alive today. When someone is abusive you just pack up and leave without even have them suspect anything-things can turn pretty ugly with abusive and mental people and there is no telling what they can do!	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	7	Exactly, the fact he thought a trip to Disneyland was going to fix deeply rooted problems in his marriage was pretty pathetic.	2.0	2.3333	2.0	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
488	8	yes, the wife should have seen this as a red flag but I guess everybody thinks that their husband, no matter how abusive will kill them and their children	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	395.0	26.0	487.0
488	9	Have you ever been in an abusive relationship?	1.3333	1.3333	1.3333	2	395.0	25.0	987.0
489	0	how sad'	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	1	I agree I cant imagine	2.0	2.3333	3.3333	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	10	yes it is very scary especially since these abusers are narcassists and know how to manipulate	2.0	4.0	3.0	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	11	Those are the scariest kind of people	2.0	3.6667	3.0	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	12	i agree	0.6667	2.0	2.0	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	13	more counselorsshould be around	1.0	2.0	2.3333	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	14	totally and awareness of how to leave	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	15	yes resources for both sides of it	0.3333	2.0	3.0	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	16	yea this happens way to often and needs to be addressed	1.3333	2.3333	2.3333	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	17	Something will get worse and it finally will	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	18	So sad	2.0	3.0	3.3333	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	19	I agree its been nice talking bye	0.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	2	she was so close to escaping	1.3333	2.3333	3.3333	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	20	Bye	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	3	I agree she just needed a little help	1.0	3.3333	3.0	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	4	i never can understandhow it gets that bad	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	5	Me niether men never can share there emotions and this happens	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	6	i agree and they end upturning to alcohal to numb themselves	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	7	Yes and then lines get crossed, I cant imagine a father or husband hurting there family how	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
489	8	its scary to think some women have no way to leave	2.0	3.6667	4.0	1	395.0	16.0	488.0
489	9	I always am afraid this will happen to me, I would not know what to do but be stuck	2.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	395.0	53.0	988.0
490	0	Those poor children and that poor dog.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	1	That was so disturbing to read. I agree, i can't believe someone can not only kill the children but also the dog?	2.0	3.3333	3.6667	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	10	You have to be an exceptional kind of depraved to murder your own children in cold blood, but yeah, I keep coming back to the dog.	1.6667	4.0	3.6667	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	11	I don't even know the logic. I'm trying to see it from her side and maybe she did it so the children don't grow up traumatized or whatever, but the  dog?? Why?!	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	12	Maybe the dog tried to intervene as she was murdering the only family the dog had.	1.3333	2.3333	2.6667	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	13	That's true, i was thinking more of the dog was outdoors and after she killed her family, she went out and shot the dog before shooting herself	1.6667	2.3333	2.6667	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	14	Or, perhaps she never liked the dog and had a grudge against it for one reason or another. Did the article mention if the woman worked?	1.3333	1.6667	2.3333	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	15	I don't believe i read anything about her. I jsut remember the husband's family saying HE was a working man. This is some Amityville Horror type stuff	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	16	No kidding. I wonder if their home was sold or destroyed.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	17	Good question, i might just search up the article because this is pretty interesting. It was nice talking to you! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	18	bye	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	2	Yeah, poor pup didn't do anything wrong. Also, who decides that a trip to Disney World is going to resolve deeply rooted marital issues?	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	3	Interesting people. I suffer from depression as well but i don't think i would ever do something that extreme.	1.3333	3.6667	2.3333	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	4	The vast majority of people who suffer from mental illnesses, myself included, are not violent in any way. It's the exceptional outliers that get all the attention.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	5	"Yes! Which is why everyone thinks people with depression are ""dangerous"" or people just want to stay away form them."	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	6	The stigma surrounding mental illness is inexcusable and unfounded, but bolstered by books, movies and television. So, the average person has no idea how warped their perception really is.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	7	These people need more help instead of people hating them you are right	1.0	2.3333	4.0	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
490	8	And more social integration. Anyway, do you think the husband knew that his wife was broadcasting her intentions on Facebook?	1.0	1.6667	2.3333	1	395.0	25.0	489.0
490	9	probably not, it was just a very messed up situatino. I still can't believe she couldn't even let the dog go.	1.6667	2.3333	3.0	2	395.0	17.0	989.0
491	0	what are your thoughts about the water	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	1	I think the situation is very troubling. How about you?	2.0	2.6667	3.0	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	10	oh yeah just wasn'tthe cleanest but no harm would come	0.6667	1.3333	1.0	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	11	yeah, I spent some time in Central America and everyone just uses those big blue bottles for drinking water.	1.0	1.3333	1.6667	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	12	oh is that safe water?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	13	yeah, it's purified water that you can get delivered or just buy from the supermarket. Water from the tap is safe to bathe in but imbibing it can make you sick.	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	14	oh that seems super helpful but i cant imagine not having the convenience of drinking from the tap	1.0	2.0	3.0	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	15	right? It's definitely a luxury that we take for granted.	0.6667	2.0	3.0	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	16	poor kids who knows the damage its done to them already	2.0	3.3333	4.0	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	17	yeah, lead is much more detrimental than other contaminants. It can actually kill you.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	18	wow I did not know that why is this not more monitored!	1.3333	3.3333	2.0	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	19	because the problem is not widespread enough, yet. Thanks for chatting with me. Hope you have a great afternoon! bye	1.3333	2.3333	1.6667	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	2	same it is scary we are suppose to be protected not lied to by the government	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	20	you two bye!	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	3	unfortunately, the government regularly fails in its intended duties. It's crazy to me that people in Flint are still having to use bottled water for everything.	1.6667	3.6667	3.6667	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	4	yeah i thought that was fixed when the media coverage went away i guess not	1.3333	2.6667	1.6667	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	5	it's been years now and those in power are still failing to act. You'd think there'd be some actor willing to take up the cause to get the problem fixed, but I think the problem stems from corporate interest.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	6	yeah i agree i thought some celebrities were doing alot in the beggining its crazy	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	7	Have you ever been in a situation where tap water was unsafe to drink?	1.0	1.0	1.6667	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
491	8	Only at my families cottage the water was all the lake water so we needed bottled water	1.3333	1.0	1.3333	1	218.0	53.0	490.0
491	9	it was safe to bathe and like brush your teeth with though, right?	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	218.0	25.0	990.0
492	0	This article is so concerning.	2.0	3.6667	3.3333	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	1	I agree.	1.0	2.3333	2.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	10	I know.  There are several counties in Eastern KY and of course Michigan than have not had clean water for years.  Those counties in Eastern Kentucky were on TV.   They are poor and do not have the extra cash to buy water all the time.   There was a huge fundraiser that was done.  They raised enough for 2 years of water for them.   Residents were showing what their water was.   It was black sludge.   The county knew it and did nothing.   He was videoed and ran from the cameras.   Makes me very angry.	2.0	4.6667	4.0	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	11	It is unacceptable. Unfortunately I don't see anything changing unless there is a new President who supports the EPA in 2020.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	12	Obama didn't do anything for them either.   It should be at the top of every sitting President's list but it gets shoeved	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	13	It is true that those things happened while Obama was in office. I just don't see how anything can be done when Andrew Wheeler is the man in charge of the EPA.	2.0	3.3333	2.0	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	14	I so agree.   EPA is run horribly.  My main concern other than the penalties/fines, etc. is what it is doing to our children.   I am extremely concerned.	2.0	3.6667	3.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	15	I am as well. This article did not even mention PFAS. Have you heard of it?	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	16	No - what is that?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	17	Substances which are used in firefighting foam and a variety of nonstick, cleaning, packaging and other household products, have been linked to thyroid disease and kidney, liver, pancreatic and testicular cancer. They get into the water supply at dangerous levels.	2.0	3.0	2.3333	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	18	Ooh.   None of this is good.   I think the whole process of getting anything done anymore is there are too many levels changes go through to get anything substantial done.	2.0	3.6667	2.3333	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	19	Yeah that and lobbyists. I hate that lobbyists are allowed to operate how they do.	1.6667	3.0	2.0	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	2	Why do all the work to see if drinking water is safe, and then assess no fines or penalties?	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	20	And PACs for elections.  They are all corrupt.	2.0	3.3333	1.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	21	Yeah the Citizens United decision did so much harm to our country I think.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	22	It did.   You are very well versed in politics.  I barely watch it.  It's all opinions and few facts.	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	23	I honestly never really paid attention to politics until 2016. It is very hard to know what is true and what is not true when it is not illegal to lie to the American people.(as long as you are not under oath.)	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	24	Every President from the beginning of time lies, lies, lies.  The only one I feel was truthful was Abraham Lincoln.   Sad to type it.	2.0	4.3333	2.0	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	25	Yup lies and fake promises tot he people while making backroom deals with corporations and lobbyists.	1.6667	3.6667	1.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	26	So true.   Well let's hope something is done before it's too late with all the water issues.   It was great interacting with you.     goodbye	1.3333	2.3333	1.3333	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	27	Yup nice talking with you. Bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	28	goodbye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	29	bye	1.0	1.0	0.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	3	Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. It is crazy that only 3% faced any sort of repercussions.	2.0	3.6667	2.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	4	I know!   So we are wasting millions in analyzing and then do nothing.   The entire article I was thinking we need more Erin Brockovich's in the world to hold all accountable.	1.3333	4.0	3.0	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	5	So true. I was thinking that the government needs to set up some sort of national task force or something similar.	0.6667	3.0	2.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	6	I feel nothing is being done due to all the kickbacks and buyoffs that has to be going on.	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	7	Yeah and all of the de-regulation. Not to mention that the head of the EPA is a stooge.	2.0	3.6667	1.6667	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
492	8	Yes he is.   I think in another 20 years, clean water will be almost unattainable	2.0	3.3333	2.0	1	218.0	8.0	491.0
492	9	I think that will surely be true in a lot of places. However certain states have their own rules when it comes to water and they are better than others. As a whole the situation is going to get a lot worse unless something is done.	1.6667	3.3333	2.3333	2	218.0	20.0	991.0
493	0	I think the people who mismanage the water should be punished.	1.3333	3.0	2.3333	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	1	i agree, it is awful	2.0	3.3333	2.6667	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	10	I agree with that.	0.6667	1.3333	1.3333	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	11	normally i'd say otherwise	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	12	It is a health crisis.	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	13	it has been going on for a long time too	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	14	I hate that it effects children so badly.	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	15	me too and could potentially cause more damage later in life	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	16	I agree with that too.	1.0	2.0	2.6667	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	17	i really hope they figure it out son	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	18	Yeah, I hope as a county we update our highways and water pipes.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	19	nice talking to you. goodbye	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	2	I think it will be happening to a lot more America cities in the future.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	20	you too. bye	0.6667	1.6667	0.6667	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	3	i dont think so after this whole ordeal	1.0	1.6667	2.0	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	4	I think a lot of cities were built with the older pipes and have not been updated, but I hope you're right.	1.3333	2.3333	2.0	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	5	i think so too. i hope not	1.6667	2.3333	2.0	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	6	I wonder what they are doing to mask the lead level.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	7	i have no idea. need more transparency	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
493	8	Do you think the federal government should step in or leave it to states?	1.0	1.0	1.3333	1	218.0	30.0	492.0
493	9	at this point i think they should step in	1.0	1.3333	1.3333	2	218.0	7.0	992.0
495	0	What did you think about the article?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	1	I think this issue is going to be a major problem for older cities, what do you think?	1.6667	2.0	2.0	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	10	It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	11	That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	12	We are the United States of America on the decline.  Pollution, drinking water, education, housing costs, 1 out of 5 people are hungry - we need to oust everyone every year in the government so it doesn't become about them personally.	1.6667	4.0	3.0	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	13	I can agree with that, outside money should have never have been allowed in government.	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	14	Agreed.   Did you see the documentary on Flint on all the neglect, corruptness, etc.?   They needed an Erin Brockavich. (Spelling)	1.6667	3.0	2.3333	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	15	No, I have not seen it. I know they switch water supplies to save money.	1.3333	2.0	2.0	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	16	It's even worse that I had imagined.  I worry about all those folks	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	17	Its hard not to get depressed thinking about all these issues because I see no end in sight.	2.0	3.3333	3.3333	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	18	Me either.   It was so very nice chatting with you.  goodbye	0.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	19	You too! bye	0.3333	2.3333	0.6667	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	2	Absolutely.  And not even older cities anymore.  Most states have areas where they have not had clean water for up to 5 years.   Small towns in Eastern Kentucky is an example	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	3	Yeah, I do not see a simple answer for this one.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	4	Me either.   EPA hands out violations but doesn't follow up or assign huge monetary fines is ridiculous.  Why do the work if there is no follow up to see if company fixed their issues	1.6667	3.0	1.6667	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	5	Not companies but local and state governments. I think what they did to Flint should be a crime.	1.6667	3.3333	2.6667	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	6	It was.    The county government in Eastern Kentucky just kept tons of money (I don't know the details - just saw it on the News) and nothing was fixed.   They have no drinking water, cooking water, or water to bathe or for toilets.  It just makes me mad.	1.6667	4.6667	3.3333	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	7	That makes me mad too. I like money too, but I wouldn't harm people to get it.	2.0	4.3333	3.3333	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
495	8	Exactly.   The checks and balances have to improve before anything gets improved.	1.3333	3.0	1.6667	1	218.0	8.0	494.0
495	9	What is the timeline of getting the people of Kentucky water back?	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	2	218.0	30.0	994.0
496	0	"I don't buy this story of a guy ""accidentally "" dying in a hotel"	2.0	2.6667	1.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	1	yea seems sketchy	1.6667	2.0	1.0	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	10	"yes, that's why USA still remains the safest place to live at this day and age-we are not perfect but at least we have rights vs countries like Russia who seem ""democratic"" and yet people are totally oppressed"	1.3333	3.0	2.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	11	I totally agree it makes you feel so grateful knowing that is not how our country runs. It is little scary knowing it did happen in the usa and america did not take criminal action.	1.0	2.3333	2.0	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	12	well, luckily we now have Trump in the house, I don;t think he will allow any garbage like this-we still have our rights and guns, thank God!	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	13	I am going to be honest I was afraid to mention trump becausemany people these days get offended but I agree 100 percent with you. Trump makes this country feel so much safer.	0.0	3.0	1.3333	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	14	I just stay away from political discussions around people because you know how they feel about Trump-but anyone with clear head knows he is good for this country-so let them get offended while he tries to give them jobs and fix their lives!	0.0	3.3333	1.3333	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	15	It feels like the media gets into peoples heads and people believe everything they hear without researching. It seems weird when new that is supposed to be non bias focuses so much on anti trump. It makes me so angry they can fool that many people.	2.0	4.0	1.3333	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	16	fake news-as Trump himself calls it. I stay away from TV as much as possible-they try to control and brainwash people, especially these young and impressionable minds.	1.6667	3.0	1.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	17	it it so sad to see how some people act towards trump especially on twitter. With recent events I have avoided twitter alltogether.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	18	yes, better to stay away, lots of negativity and deranged people out there	2.0	2.6667	1.3333	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	19	they will complain the entire time the economy is doing great and whie they lead successful lives because of trump. People like Bernie Sanders make me so angry they play on poor peoples hot points making false promises they know they can never fulfill.	2.0	3.3333	1.0	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	2	we know that Russian dictators take out anyone who is against them	2.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	20	Bernie is a crazy but job-on top of that he is a filthy rich person that most of these silly people don;t know, he always beats himself on the chest like he was poor and knows what it's like but the guy has mansions all over the place	2.0	3.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	21	and he can't even fulfill his promises of $15 wages for his employees because he knows how bad of an idea that is.	2.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	22	precisely, anyone who wants to see him elected is out of their mind. there will be a communism.	1.6667	3.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	23	i agree! have you ever watched the joe rogan podcast?	0.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	24	unfortunately not	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	25	I highly recommend he brings a great non biased platform for everyone to speak while also asking the important questions	0.3333	2.0	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	26	thank you, I will look into it	0.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	27	Awesome! I really enjoyed talking politics with you!	0.0	2.6667	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	28	same here, thank you and God bless, goodbye!	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	29	God bless to you as well! goodbye	0.0	2.3333	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	3	yes i heard bout another story where they attempted to kill  a father and daughter who were spies	1.6667	2.0	0.6667	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	4	or the guy who got poisoned a while ago, they slipped something in his tea	1.6667	2.3333	1.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	5	they definitely do not do a great job of covering it up	1.6667	2.6667	1.0	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	6	or they simply don;t care, I recall they shot somebody last year in Ukraine, in the broad day light!	2.0	3.0	1.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	7	wow that is insane! the 3 diffrent causes of death have me puzzled. They are three completely different ways to die and they fumbled over the official cause for a long time which was odd.	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
496	8	"Putin will not let any real ""investigations"" take place-that place is a total lawless land, I feel really bad for the people there"	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	103.0	26.0	495.0
496	9	i do as well. He makes it seem like the people are free but they are not. it's very dangerous.	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	103.0	16.0	995.0
498	0	It is hard to believe he had all those injuries, but we will never know.	1.3333	2.0	1.6667	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	1	What a tragedy!	2.0	3.6667	4.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	10	I agree with that. I wonder what made the family say heart attack so quickly.	1.0	2.0	2.3333	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	11	Maybe pressure from the government?	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	12	That is more than likely true.	1.6667	1.3333	2.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	13	So sad to live under that type of government	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	14	Yeah, I think all governments have their dirty secrets.	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	15	I hope for the family's sake they can get a real answer. Although I doubt it will happen	1.6667	3.0	3.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	16	I think they got the same answers that we were given.	1.3333	1.3333	2.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	17	Very suspicious either way	2.0	2.0	1.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	18	Do you have any other thoughts about the article?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	19	Overall I think that level of government corruption is terrifying	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	2	I do not know if I would call it a tragedy, but it is sad when anybody dies.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	20	I agree with that.	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	21	It has been nice chatting with you. Goodbye.	0.6667	1.3333	0.6667	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	22	You too! bye	0.3333	1.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	3	The circumstances do raise a number of questions about what may have really occurred	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	4	I agree with that. I do not trust Russia because they are known for killing people who upset the government.	1.6667	2.0	1.6667	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	5	There seem to be a lot of issues in Russia that deserve a closer look	1.3333	2.0	1.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	6	The thing that stood out most for me were the injures to other parts of the body. I could understand a head injury from a fall.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	7	Yeah, it makes me suspicious of the official explanation as well	2.0	2.3333	1.6667	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
498	8	And it took so long for the investigation.	2.0	2.0	1.3333	1	103.0	30.0	497.0
498	9	And we will probably never know the full story	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	2	103.0	43.0	997.0
499	0	Hi there, so what did you think of it?	1.0	1.3333	0.6667	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	1	I think he needs to be overthrown	1.6667	2.6667	1.3333	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	10	yeah what do you think would be best?	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	11	an assacination no way hell relinquish power, and anyone in russia is to afraid to go against him	2.0	3.3333	1.0	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	12	I know his approval ratings are at an all time low. the public is very unhappy with him in Russia	2.0	2.0	1.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	13	They need to over throw him have a revolution	1.3333	3.3333	1.0	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	14	yeah maybe so.  someone there needs to organize something I guess	1.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	15	He would have them killed is the issue	2.0	2.6667	1.0	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	16	yeah probably so.  I guess they are just stuck	1.6667	2.0	1.3333	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	17	crazy theres still evil dictators in 2019	2.0	3.3333	1.3333	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	18	yeah it seems so archaic	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	19	need to just kill them and move on	2.0	4.0	1.0	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	2	who, Putin?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	20	yes unfortunately	1.6667	2.0	1.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	21	it was nice chatting bye	0.3333	1.6667	0.6667	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	22	you too bye	1.0	1.6667	0.6667	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	3	yes, the scary dictator	2.0	3.0	1.3333	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	4	oh yeah, he does seem to be trouble.  what did you think of the guy who OD'd?	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	5	I think it was all a hit job	1.6667	2.6667	2.0	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	6	oh maybe so.  I had not thought of that.  I figured he just drank himself to death.	1.3333	1.6667	1.6667	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	7	Putin has done so many hits against epople that trade i wouldnt be suprised	1.6667	2.3333	2.3333	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
499	8	yeah you're right, I wouldn't be surprised either	1.6667	1.6667	2.0	1	103.0	24.0	498.0
499	9	something needs to be done so hes not in power anymore	1.6667	2.6667	1.6667	2	103.0	53.0	998.0
500	0	Hi what u think?	1.0	1.3333	1.0	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	1	I think Russia did it	1.0	0.6667	1.0	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	10	Maybe, I can see you dying from a fall but it would not involve your whole body	1.6667	2.0	3.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	11	That is true. I think he was murdered	1.3333	2.6667	3.0	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	12	I have never fell while drinking have you?	1.3333	1.3333	1.6667	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	13	No i have better balance when i am drinking	0.6667	1.3333	1.6667	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	14	Yeah it could have been murder	1.6667	2.0	2.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	15	lol	0.3333	2.0	1.0	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	16	Do you think maybe he was force to kill himself	1.6667	2.0	2.6667	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	17	I think somebody killed him	2.0	2.3333	2.3333	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	18	Or he could have slipped on something. Either way, i feel bad for the poor man. He was probably very nice.	2.0	3.3333	4.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	19	I don't know if he was nice or not. It was nice chatting with you! bye	0.3333	1.6667	1.3333	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	2	me too. i think they are hiding it to be honest	1.0	1.6667	1.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	20	ok thank you. bye!	0.3333	1.6667	1.0	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	3	It sounds too weird to me	1.6667	1.6667	1.3333	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	4	I think so. why would he just kill himself	2.0	2.0	2.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	5	I can see him falling once	1.6667	1.3333	2.3333	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	6	I see him probably fell down and hurt himself maybe?	1.3333	1.6667	2.6667	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	7	Maybe he fell and hurt himself?	1.3333	1.3333	2.6667	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
500	8	I feel bad for the guy's family	1.3333	3.0	4.3333	1	103.0	17.0	499.0
500	9	Me too. They are not just in shock and will never really know what happened to him	2.0	2.6667	4.3333	2	103.0	30.0	999.0
209	0	This article is a bit old, referencing the 2016 campaign, but it is still poignant and relevant today.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	1	I agree. How do you think police and race relations can be handled better?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	10	Yeah, or rather they only care so far as it keeps them entrenched in the 1%	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	11	I always wonder when enough money is enough.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	12	Well, it's tough, because competition and profit fuels development, but it's a fact that wages have been stagnate (or even dropped against the value of the dollar) since the mid-90s	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	13	Jeff Bezos could pay more, but he rather see the fake number go up in his bank account.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	14	Ha, oh, that number is very real...	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	15	Can he withdraw 75 billion dollars?. At some point it is just a number in account. I see your point too.	1.0	3.0	3.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	16	Yeah, all you need to know about what Bezos thinks of people is look at mturk: we're all busting our butts in bubble hell to sniff minimum wage - but, at least I can do it in my robe...	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	17	Do you think all this class,race is just part of the human condition?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	18	That's an interesting question. Probably. I often say that if you want to know what humanity is about, just look around at what we do. We are what we do. But, a lot of it is due to developing in a climate of scarcity, where there is the perception that there are not enough to go around (which really should not be true anymore).	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	19	I agree. I think people are just scared to let their guard down because they do not want to lose what they have.	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	2	I don't think they can directly. They are symptoms of a larger problem.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	20	Yes. It's tough. But, what is going to happen in 20 years when automation, robotics, and AI eliminates A LOT of jobs. WE're already nearing a tipping point. What happens when there are simply not enough jobs for people anymore?	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	3	This is why NFL players were taking a knee.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	4	Yes, even though that was co-opted to become about being anti-patriotic...	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	5	I know the police know how to take people in alive, look at most mass shooters.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	6	True. Now, I believe that there are way more good police than bad, but it's obvious that some people are attracted to police work because it gives them a gun and the license to use it in public without fear of retribution	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	7	I agree that there are good police. I think they should be held to a high standard	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	8	Yes. Really, again, these are just symptoms though. Most of these social conflicts are really just proxies for the real problem, which is wealth disparity, which leads to scapegoating	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	9	Yeah, most super rich people do not care what happens to people no matter what their race is.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
58	15	That's the question. The news media seems more like propaganda to me these days. Almost like school children hurling insults back and forth. So something like the illegal ivory trade would definitely get pushed to the bottom of the news worthy list.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	16	I totally agree. It seems news media are more like the old tabloids going for shock value and trying to get the most following and not worried about real news issues and trying to educate the people. Things going on in Africa are so far away, it's easy to let those kinds of issues slide in favor of the latest scandal to get ratings.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	17	Yeah. I think awareness is key. Increase awareness and maybe it will effect change. I mean, I wasn't aware poaching was this bad of a problem until reading this article.	1.0	4.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	18	Awareness, education and meaningful discussions of what the loss elephants can mean to the world are definitely a key.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	19	With all the problems occurring worldwide I don't have much faith in anything stopping poaching honestly.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	20	Unfortunately, I think I have to agree. Unless the poaching starts having an impact on our daily lives, I fear most will simply ignore it as something that doesn't matter.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	21	Yeah, it really is unfortunate. Those elephants don't deserve that, and I'm sure it's frustrating to the rangers trying to stop it. People just don't care anymore unless it's right smack dab in their face.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	22	Definitely. And the rangers that are putting their lives on the line to try and make a difference aren't being respected either.	2.0	4.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	23	Yeah I remember the article said those rangers were being shot at on sight by the poachers. That's madness. Seems like it would be taken more seriously if it's that dangerous out there.	2.0	4.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	24	"I fear that it's so ""wild"" as the animals need it that it's hard to take care of the rangers anymore than the animals. But I agree, rangers just being shot at for doing their jobs is another outrage."	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	25	Yeah, I'm sure funding is an issue as well. Hiring more rangers, or even bringing in some kind of military presence probably isn't an option.	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	26	Seems issues always boil down to the same things. More money needed. More education needed. More knowledge. More awareness.	1.0	3.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	27	Yeah, and when those things are lacking, everything just gets worse and worse.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	28	I have to agree. I hope that by raising our own awarness with conversations like these we can start seeing some change. I've enjoyed this conversation and want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas. I've enjoyed our talk, goodbye.	0.0	3.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	29	I enjoyed it as well, goodbye.	0.0	0.0	0.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
231	0	As a man this makes me sick to see other men behave this way.	2.0	4.0	3.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	1	It's definitely an issue that's existed forever and I wonder whether it can truly change.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	10	Yeah all of these issues need to be addressed in the proper manner. The world is so fast paced that most people do not have time to worry about issues that do not effect them.	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	11	"I think we were all a lot happier when we were less ""informed.""  Connection and information are a double-edged sword, if nothing else."	2.0	2.0	4.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	12	We would be happier, but some people would be suffering in the dark.	2.0	2.0	5.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	13	Sure.  But are they being helped now?  I guess that's the question.  All of our consternation and anger--is it genuinely improving people's lives?  That's a complicated question, of course.  And certainly some people's are.  I just wonder what the net effect is.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	14	I think bringing these issues to the light are helping some people. I think it is better than not thinking about them or hiding them.	2.0	2.0	5.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	15	Certainly could be.  Do you think the net effect of the metoo stuff (apropos this article) has been positive?	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	16	Yes, because more men are thinking about their behavior.	0.0	2.0	4.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	2	Your right, I do not think it will change either.	2.0	1.0	2.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	3	I'm afraid that it's also become such a contentious issue that it's hard to even trust allegations anymore when they're in the political sphere.  Which is very sad for people who do experience actual harassment.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	4	It is hard but when you hear somebody say grab them by the P, it is not hard to see that person actually doing that.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	5	Sure, although the person you're referring to also makes a lot of boasts and claims that are not true, so who's to say that wasn't just him bragging.  I'm just saying that every time there's a false allegation, and there are, it undermines the credibility of every single woman who legitimately experiences it.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	6	I agree that some woman make false allegations, but I do not think it is the majority.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	7	"I agree, I think most allegations have some truth.  But I also think we've gotten hysterical about this stuff, so when someone says, ""I was sexually harassed,"" or even ""assaulted,"" I don't know what that means.  I think that's unfortunate too."	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
231	8	It is the climate we live in today. Some of the claims you say, wait a minute that does not sound right, but we should still listen.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	9	The other thing about these issues is that we just seem to cycle through them and then lose interest and go onto something else.  Sexual harassment, blacks getting shot by cops, mass shooting, something Trump has done, North Korea or Russia or China, and then back to someone being sexually harassed.  It's just weird how quickly these issues come and go and then come back again, seemingly with no progress, just more ire.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0
163	18	Petitions, donation drives, contacting politicians and informing them these are issues you care about. I suppose all of those could help. I'm not sure it's enough though.	0.0	2.0	1.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	19	I am sure all these things would be helpful, but I am not convinced it would be enough. I would propose a more hands on approach by taking people to actively patrol conservation zones are at least to a zoo or similar area so they can have some face to face time with these animals. What do you think>	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	20	Yeah I'm sure that would convince some, but in order for real change, it would require a large number of people to make this an important issue for them. How many people are gonna take off work to go to the zoo lol.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	21	With sufficient motivation there is nothing stopping what someone will do. The question is how do we get people sufficiently motivated? I would really miss the polar bears when they are all gone	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	22	If I'm being honest, I don't think I would. In fact, I doubt I'd even notice if it did happen. I've never seen one person, and I don't think they would have any impact on my life. I do believe they should be saved, but in terms of what I would be willing to do to help? Probably not much.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	23	Wow. Why wouldn't you be willing to help?	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	24	What could I do? I could donate money. What else could one person do to have a meaningful impact on polar bears in Norway? Then there's the elephants in Africa, the dolphins are also being killed off in mass, etc etc etc	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	25	So you feel overwhelmed?	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	26	Well, not so much overwhelmed, but just that there isn't anything more than just donating money I could realistically do. Unless I wanted to travel to Norway and volunteer with the organization that is tasked with protecting the bears. Which isn't realistic for me.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	27	What could be some other realistic ways for you to get involved beside donating money?	1.0	1.0	3.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	28	That's the thing, I can't really think of any.	1.0	1.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	29	There has to be some interesting way you can make a contribution outside of giving a donation	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	30	Do you have any ideas?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	31	I mentioned them already. I would rather not suggest anything punitive like fines or taxes	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	32	Yeah, I don't think people would agree with more taxes anyway.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	33	I am trying to think of something like earth day where some people plant trees. That is a great conservationist effort	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	34	Yeah, that could be a good way to raise awareness at least. Well, I enjoyed this conversation with you. goodbye	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	35	bye	1.0	0.0	0.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
336	0	it was a pretty sad story	2.0	3.0	4.0	1	223.0	33.0	335.0

I think the goal of having women not sexually harassed and assaulted is good and I agree some people are probably thinking about their behavior or even changing it now.  But I think the general relationship between men and women is strained and growing contentious.  I'm not sure how to address some of these issues without that happening, unfortunately.  But I think that, at times, there is a definite ""men versus women"" mentality growing in the country and world, and, at least in the short term, it's harmful in ways.  Is the end result worth it?  Maybe. But it's still an issue, I think."	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0

231	28	Yes, one of my sisters was date raped at a party while she was in college and she is just know talking about it. I always wonder why women wait to say something, but I have never been in their shoes.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	128.0	30.0	230.0
231	29	I'm not surprised they don't report it.  I'm sure there's a lot of fear and shame involved.  I do think it's an impediment to this issue being handled properly though.  If men are going to be held accountable, accusations can't come 30 years later.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	128.0	48.0	730.0

94	0	It is a shame that these survivors were abused by the people they sought refuge from	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	1	Yeah, I suppose that is just the type of lawlessness that exists in these countries.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	10	The camps were not exclusively for women. But they should have been segregated for women and children	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	11	Ideally, I think you're right, I just wonder what Nigeria's resources and capabilities are to provide for that.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	12	Nigeria is relatively wealthy compared to its neighbors on the continent. It is one of the wealthiest African nations. Their government has issues with corruption	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	13	I wasn't aware that Nigeria was so wealthy.  I still think wealthy is a relative term when comparing to other African nations.  Especially when you see the issues they're struggling against like this Boko Haram.	2.0	3.0	1.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	14	Nigeria has wealth stemming from the countries oil reserves. It is rich in a particular type of crude oil that has fewer impurities. But the country is corrupt and the wealth is not evenly distributed, which can lead to many other social problems	2.0	2.0	1.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	2	What do yo mean?	1.0	2.0	0.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	3	In these countries where Islam is prominent, it's kind of the wild west.	1.0	3.0	2.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	4	So you believe Nigeria is lawless because of Islam?	1.0	3.0	1.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	5	No, I was merely stating that in any of these middle east and north african countries, these types of events are common.  Just so happens Islam exists there.	1.0	3.0	1.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	6	I see. I saw it as more of an indication of corruption and dereliction. I hope they have provided adequate counseling services for the victims	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	7	Yeah, it's really terrible that some of the women were impregnated by their abusers.  I don't know how the woman's relationship with the baby will develop after that.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
94	8	I don't know either. The guards at these camps should have been women	1.0	2.0	1.0	1	233.0	35.0	93.0
94	9	I'm not sure I noticed in the article, but was the camp strictly for women?  If there were male victims included in there, that wouldn't be a possibility.	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	233.0	49.0	593.0
163	0	I wish this article gave more information on the subject.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	1	I was thinking the same thing. Based on the information given what do you think?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	10	"I bet the practices they are doing is good, just probably needs more funding. I feel like any kind of ""save the insert animal here"" effort is promoted it doesn't get very much traction, people don't seem to care. Which ultimately will lead to funding problems, they end up cutting corners or not being able to do everything they planned, and more animals die."	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	11	What makes you think that people don't seem to care?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	12	Well, care in the sense that they are motivated to effect change. The news media certainly isn't pushing these stories to the top. I'm sure people care enough to sign a petition or something along those lines, but would they even donate money? Who knows. What do you think about what's being done so far?	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	13	I think humanity needs to do much more. I agree about the media not focusing on these issues. I think government needs to do much more to protect endangered animals and hold people accountable. Do you think the issue regarding the polar bears in the article may be related to climate change?	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	14	It's certainly possible. At least the warming of the climate effecting polar bears in general, probably not the issue of visitors killing them. You are right the government should be doing more. But that all goes back to people not caring. Listen to any politician speak, they won't say anything about protecting any endangered animals, it's all health care, economy, illegal immigration etc	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	15	Maybe the polar bears are coming into contact with humans more because their habitat is melting away. The politicians will talk about whatever they think people want to hear. What do you think is a good way to get people to care more about conservation issues?	2.0	1.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	16	Yeah that certainly is possible. Raising awareness is one area. I didn't know  there were problems with the polar bears in Norway until reading this article. More attention needs to be on these issues. Although, there's so many animals being threatened, do you think we run the risk of flooding people with too much and people being overwhelmed and just ignoring it all?	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	17	That is certainly a possibility. But too much information is better than too little. What might be some ways to get people more actively involved once awareness has been raised?	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	2	I guess I'm not very surprised. Seems like endangered species are getting wiped out all over the world. I just saw another article about elephants in africa being killed for their ivory.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	3	Yes I did as well. Also the last known female Yangtze turtle just died. Humanity has to do better	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	4	I'm not very hopeful it will. It's like no one really cares at all about these issues. As long as profits are to be made anyway.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	5	I am inclined to agree. Partially. I understand that greed is very powerful, but it is the lowest of all human emotions. I think people can rise above it someday. I hope it's not too late when we do	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	6	That article was lacking so much information. Would be nice to know what steps they are taking to try to protect the bears. I think a video was supposed to be included.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	7	I agree. I was also wondering how many polar bears were affected. What steps do you think should be taken?	1.0	1.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
163	8	I'm not really sure. I mean, if people have legitimate reasons for being there and are in danger of being attacked by a polar bear, they should have the right to defend themselves. But maybe restricting access to the places where these bears are would work? I'm not really sure.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	375.0	46.0	162.0
163	9	I doubt anyone has a truly legitimate reason for being that close to polar bear habitats. How do you think conservation efforts as a whole can be improved?	1.0	2.0	2.0	2	375.0	35.0	662.0
209	21	Hopefully universal basic income.	0.0	1.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	22	Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Basically, a form of socialism, but it's hard to get there without a real economic collapse. As long as it functions somewhat, then we're stuck with the current economic model, which means more racial scapegoating and more violence.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	23	Sadly I have to agree with you. Most American think health care is not a right.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	24	Yeah, and that's the problem. We're just content with what we're given.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	25	Police departments and Fire departments are forms of socialism but people don't complain about them.	2.0	2.0	3.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	26	Yeah, our values are just out of whack. But, again, it is who we are. We want to point a finger at some 'other', some boogeyman, because it's easier and safer than point a finger at a crooked system, because that seems like too big of a problem to solve.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	27	The government has long stopped working in the interest of the common man.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	28	True, but it's not just the government, it's everything, all of it. The whole structure and processes of society. It's a massive problem that will only be solved if we reach some crisis that necessitates huge change.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	29	Climate change or an asteroid.	2.0	1.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	30	Yes, something at that level. People won't change unless their comfort is threatened. It doesn't have to be existential, but big enough to rattle everyone.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	31	Do you think police should be enforcing laws dealing with what an adult does with their own body?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	32	Well, I think there are way too many laws governing personal behavior. Most things that do not directly harm others should be legal. Abortion. Suicide. Gambling. Prostitution. Some drugs. Legalize, regulate and tax. The problem isn't the act themselves, it's the criminality, which breeds abuse and exploitation, because where can you turn if you know that what you're doing could get you locked up?	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	33	I can see how see how some women can be forced into prostitution. I believe all drugs should be legal. I would hate for one of my children to overdose, but I would also hate for one of my children to die from a heart attack from eating Big Macs all day which is not illegal.	2.0	3.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	34	Yes, that's right. Our society shouldn't punish people for making what others would deem to be a mistake. It should be more forgiving and permissive. Drug addition should not be a criminal matter - it should be viewed as a public health matter.	0.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	35	Do you think we should make police less militarized?	1.0	1.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	36	Probably, but I also think that there should be way more police. And, yeah, the role of police should shift away from 'catching bad guys' to supporting communities.	0.0	3.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	37	Like back in the day when they knew the people's names in the community.	0.0	2.0	2.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	38	Yes, exactly - I also think that police should live in the precincts they work in.	0.0	2.0	3.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	39	I agree with that.	1.0	2.0	1.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
209	40	Well, ti was really cool chatting with you. I don't know if we solved any of society's problems, but it was fun. goodbye	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	201.0	51.0	208.0
209	41	Great chatting with you too! goodbye	1.0	0.0	0.0	2	201.0	30.0	708.0
58	0	The idea that we are still allowing so many endangered animals to be killed and especially an animal as gentle and amazing as an elephant is just heartbreaking. I feel so frustrated, angry and helpless over this situation. I do think it is time to crack down on those buying the ivory as strongly as those poaching.	2.0	4.0	4.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	1	It really is ridiculous. But what more can be done? It's been banned in multiple countries. I've even heard of groups of people who arm themselves and go out to personally stop poachers, and yet it still continues. I'm not sure what else could be done to stop this from happening.	2.0	3.0	4.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	10	I do think the west will have to step in. Unfortunately, it takes a major outrage before we seem to be able to get all the west willing to do more.	1.0	2.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	11	You're right. Not to mention with all the political nonsense going on right now, I think people are being overwhelmed with problems and issues and just kind of ignore it all.	2.0	2.0	1.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	12	Well it's so easy to ignore it now. We don't like something on social media, we can just ignore those posting about it. Something has to be done to make it not so easy to ignore.	2.0	2.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	13	Yeah, I also think it's because people don't know what to trust anymore. Can we really say the news sources are trustworthy? Officials are lying, news commentators are biased, social media is full of nonsense, who wants to deal with that?	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	14	So very true. Who do we even believe anymore? Where can we turn to get information that we can believe in.	1.0	3.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	2	There is no obvious simple solution and I think that is part of the problem. I think it's hindered by so many African countries that are poor and the amount of money made on the blackmarket for ivory just makes it difficult to stop.	2.0	3.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	3	I think you are right about cracking down on the buyers. Maybe trying to stop the poachers is a losing effort, but going after the buyers may have an impact. But these criminal blackmarkets are probably very difficult to shut down.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	4	Oh yes, that is nearly as difficult as the poachers I'm sure. But even beyond the buyers, those that are buying ivory items and maybe not realizing what that means is a big factor I think. If we educate more people about what having an ivory figurine means, perhaps that can be a start as well.	2.0	2.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	5	I'm sure that would go a long way. It's at least something that could be done that may have an impact. As we've seen from the drug trade, stopping illegal items from being sold is almost impossible. I'm sure there's levels of corruption involved as well. There's so much money to be made I bet a lot of these officials are cashing in and turning a blind eye as well.	2.0	3.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	6	Oh exactly, it always comes down to the money. Stop them being able to make a profit and perhaps we can stop the senseless killing.	0.0	2.0	2.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	7	And when it's the officials who are getting paid, the ones who are supposed to be stopping this, it makes it that much harder.	2.0	2.0	2.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
58	8	Yes corruption I'm sure is very huge. It has to take everyone being on the same page to make a difference. As the article stated having each country giving elephants different levels of protection shows that no one is seeing this issue in the same way.	2.0	3.0	3.0	1	72.0	44.0	57.0
58	9	I think if the west took more of an interest in this things could get done. Poaching still a problem? Cut the aid given to the country. If they make it a priority things will change.	1.0	2.0	3.0	2	72.0	46.0	557.0
