1	0	what did you think about this article	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	1	It's definitely really sad to read, considering everything they're all going through. What did you think?	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	10	It is hard to fathom/process, it's hard for me to really imagine	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	11	Give it twenty more years, for the more compassionate people to come into leadership. I think we'll see a big difference.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	12	I think that is a fair statement... the new generation seems more caring and compassionate and willing to help	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	13	I know it sounds cold, but the older generation either doesn't care, or doesn't want to understand. Trust me, we'll see some major change soon enough.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	14	I totally agree... I know there are some out there that care, but the majority, and the ones in charge, really don't seem to	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	15	Well, it was really great talking to you. I can't think of anything else to say about the topic. goodbye	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	16	we don't have enough lines yet	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	17	I apologize, I thought we did! I'm obviously a winner at counting. Hurricane Matthew was two years ago, wasn't it?	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	18	Haha no worries, we should be there now. That sounds about right to me, crazy, time flies, seems like I was just hearing about it	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	19	I think I recall it spawning a second hurricane, too, but it calmed down before being too bad. Yeah, I was definitely a few lines off lol	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	2	I think it's super sad... they seem to never catch a break, always struggling.	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	20	I kinda remember that too...Well it has been great talking to you! bye :)	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	21	take care! goodbye	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	3	I can't imagine just living in an area that is constantly being ravaged by hurricanes or earthquakes. I take my location for granted.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	4	Me too.. I also can't imagine living in the poverty and such.. It's crazy to think that people still live like that sometimes.  The gap between first world countires and places like that is crazy to em	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	5	It also seems unnecessary for there to even be such a gap. With all of the wealthy countries out there, I hope Haiti gets the help it deserves, because we, and other countries, can certainly afford it.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	6	Agreed... with how frivilous and unnessary our spending is, it's so sad that countries like that don't get more support or guidance.	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	7	It's disheartening, isn't it? Places have the ability, money, time, and knowledge, and still refuse to help.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
1	8	It is so sad... Or even the millionaires/billionaires out there. I know some of them donate, but at some point, you can only spend so much money. Why not put it to use.	1	35.0	68.0	0.0
1	9	Yep, exactly. It's just very frustrating overall. I think it's hard for others because they don't understand until their houses are being swept away for torrential floods.	2	35.0	66.0	500.0
4	0	Do you think the people of Haiti will ever recover from the effects of these recent natural disasters?	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	1	I am not sure it is a quite poor area :(	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	10	Do you think the United States has a vested interest in a developed and autonomous Haiti? I don't think so	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	11	Yeah I would not count on it. So you think the change should come from within?	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	12	Yes. I think that is the only way to get lasting long term and meaningful change. We have to help them help themselves	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	13	Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	14	I disagree. With all the corruption it would just be money wasted. We should control the funds and focus more on sending people and material	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	15	Yeah but you can not have it both ways, either we send money and get power and control, or we send it no strings attached. So I think there might have to be strings actually, as you reminded me of the corruption.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	16	Some other questions would be how much money and how long would we have to be involved?	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	17	I think the article said the UN was looking to send $800 million. No more then ten years in my opinion	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	18	I think 10 years is a good figure. But it seems like any problems Haiti has are only made worse by natural disasters. And no one can stop those	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	19	Yes there will always be disasters. Until the core problem of the country is fixed, I think we will always have to be ready to help.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	2	Yes it is. The people there need a lot of help. What do you think are some of the best ways to get them the help they need	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	20	That might take a lot longer than 10 years. It might be a good idea if the UN established permanent or semi permanent facilitiesc	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	21	Yes I think if we could supply them advisers and disaster professionals they could greatly benefit	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	22	True, but who would want to go there long term? I know I wouldn't. It's so far away and so different	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	23	I probably would not. We would have to compensate those individuals well.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	24	The compensation would have to be high to motivate the right people	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	25	Yeah but I think the fact they would be helping those in need, could also be a motivation	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	26	True but would it be enough to keep them from their friends and family for long durations?	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	27	Probably different for each person, I am optimistic though.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	28	Yes I can see that. It has been nice chatting. We have to bring our conversation to a conclusion	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	29	Yes this has been enjoyable. bye	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	3	I think if the UN is able to get them the required funds that will help a lot.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	30	goodbye	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	4	I am inclined to disagree. More money is only a temporary solution. I think they need lasting change	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	5	Yes, I hear there is a lot of corruption there as well, that is also a problem. Money is short term	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	6	Yes corruption is a huge problem. I think the NGO's and the UN should focus more on teaching the Haitian people to help themselves and develop the country	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	7	Yes getting a better government is the best way to help any region. Most countries, do not absolutely need outside for every disaster	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
4	8	I don't think the US wants a ''better'' government. They want a government they can control or influence. Corruption helps with that agenda	1	35.0	79.0	3.0
4	9	Yes two things can be true at once though. They want a better government but also try to get power and control in the process.	2	35.0	97.0	503.0
7	0	What did you think about this article	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	1	this just made me so sad he was a great guy	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	10	Yes I would hope... Did he have much family did it say?	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	11	his family mother was in cuba came to see him once at a game	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	12	Oh yah that's right... Poor lady. It must be hard with no real closure, so suddenly like that	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	13	and being so far away and speaking spanish its not easy to come here form cuba i wonder if the funeral will be in cuba	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	14	I would hope so for her sake, and I';m sure he has other family down there	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	15	yeah very true feel bad for his friends families two	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	16	Yah... his mom shouldn't have to deal with travelling to a new foreign country on top of her grieving	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	17	Im sure the team will take care alot of it they helped her get her visa and loved him	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	18	That's true I didn't think about that... I bet they will be good support for her	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	19	yeah that would be a great support for them	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	2	It makes me sad too...	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	20	And I'm sure they'd like to get to know his mom more, now that he is not around. See where he came from kind og	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	21	oh yes agreed, this has been a great conversation!	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	22	It has been for me as well! goodbye :)	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	23	bye!	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	3	crazy how fast they were going	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	4	It is... seems so dangerous.	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	5	yeah i wonder if eventually they will discover drugs or alchol	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	6	"I wouldn't be surprised... a ""celebrity"" like that, it seems like it'd be normal almost"	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	7	True but man he was such a great guy with good morals guess you really never now people	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
7	8	That is true... It's hard to think about.. I hope there was no suffering for him. I hope it was quick as could be.	1	213.0	68.0	6.0
7	9	I agree probably upon impact hopefully	2	213.0	96.0	506.0
9	0	Hey how are you? Are you a baseball fan?	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	1	Hey there. I am not but i do feel really sorry for the player! You?	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	10	Oh, nothing bad. Really good actually but I am 7 months pregnant and it's just not fun. haha So I just want it to be December already.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	11	Oh wow, congrats to you!	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	12	Thank you much. It's a great thing but just exhausting as expected!	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	13	I can't even imagine! But back to the sotry, i hope the family is fine now.	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	14	Yes, that would be a hard loss. Unexpected deaths are obviously way harder.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	15	True. I heard of KINDA a similar incident with a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. It's all so terrible	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	16	Oh man. Especially when someone does it for a living, it's hard to have any sort of life altering injury. It definitely crushes their spirits.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	17	For sure! It's very heartbreaking. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	18	goodbye.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	2	I am not a fan but yes such a tragedy. I can	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	3	I feel bad not only for him but his family as well	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	4	Exactly. He was so young too. I can't even fathom losing a son so young. Parents should never have to bury their children but you hear it happening almost every day these days.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	5	Yeah accidents happen and you just never know what will happen. :(	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	6	Most definitely. It makes you just want to hug your loved ones because you never know what'll happen.	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	7	Yup, i try to live by the motto live everyday like it's your last but it's not easy to follow	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
9	8	No, it's really not. You take each day for granted. I am in a season of my life where I just keep wishing the days away and hoping time speeds up. But it's no way to live because you miss the small moments!	1	213.0	84.0	8.0
9	9	I totally agree. If you don't mind me asking , why are you hoping time speeds up?	2	213.0	70.0	508.0
12	0	What did you think about this article	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	1	I always think stories of foster kids are pretty sad.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	10	for sure! I just wish he could have been helped out more in the process, or for it to be easier on him	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	11	Yes, although I'd also go back to the mother and say the problem starts there. The mother (and probably father) were the first to let the kids down.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	12	Agreed.... I can't imagine being that kind of parent. i don't get people who are. But there seems to be so many	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	13	Yes, unfortunately.  It's very easy to have children but not so easy to raise them well.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	14	For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	15	Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	16	For sure... it seems everyone has parent problems, but then seem to end up parenting the same way	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	17	It's a strange phenomenon.  At least to me.  But we're often more creatures of habit and genetics and convenience than of thoughtful consideration and values.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	18	That is a great way to phrase it... It's very interesting for sure. Especially when you have 18+years to change	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	19	Do you have any children?	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	2	I agree... it's such a bad system sometimes and it breaks my heart, cause they are kids	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	20	I don't, but my husband and I are trying	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	21	Sounds fun.  I hope you're successful and you, your husband, and future children are all thankful for it.  I don't have kids and figure it's best for all parties involved that it stays that way.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	22	thank you! haha my husband felt that way for a while... It's scary for  sure the thought of bringing another human into this world	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	23	Yes,it's certainly a big responsibility.  But I'm sure you'll do fine.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	24	Thank you! I sure will try haha	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	25	Anyway, it's been nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	26	bye	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	3	Of course the kids make matters worse with delinquency, but that's not unexpected behavior considering their experiences.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	4	Agreed, I'm sure he would be less likely to do that if he  had grown up in more stable conditions. It seems a lot of times the foster care system puts them in a situation that is just as bad or worse then where they wer ebefore	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	5	Yes, although even in good situations it sometimes doesn't work.  I knew an adopted boy and girl who'd come from a very violent background.  They destroyed the adoptive family they were brought into.  The damage had already been done to them as people.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	6	Oh that's so sad... My neighbors did foster care a lot, and they were a great family. but man some of the kids you could tell had been through some shit and they were so angry.	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	7	Yeah, bless the people who are willing to do that.  And I'm sure most have good intentions.  But it's definitely a tough situation for everyone.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
12	8	Agreed, I'm sure it would put a strain on any family or couple, especially if the kids are a handful	1	78.0	68.0	11.0
12	9	At least there was something of a silver lining in this story.	2	78.0	91.0	511.0
15	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	1	I think it's sad that a kid would have to go through all that...	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	10	Pretty much. He just hasn't improved for the better and jail didn't really help him	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	11	Yah and I bet that is the case for a lot of people... how sad	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	12	The kid should be out making friends and playing video games.. not rotting in jail	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	13	I agree... It's so sad because he has already missed out on so so much of his childhood, and had it be horrible, and now this. He just needs a break and someone who actually cares about him	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	14	Hopefully he finds a girl he can marry that cares about him because his family doesnt	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	15	I hope so too, and that he is able to hold a healthy relationship	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	16	It just makes you wonder how many other children are out there being put in cells..	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	17	Probably way too many	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	18	Agreed. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	19	you as well, bye	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	2	It's terrible! I feel so bad for the kid because he should be in school.	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	3	Agreed, he should just be allowed to be a kid and not have to deal with all that	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	4	He probably was terrified and is going to be scarred for life now..	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	5	Oh yah, he'll definitly have the trauma of it all to deal with the rest of his life	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	6	Do you think jail can really change the kid for the better?	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	7	I think he needs therapy and guidance and  a stable home more so than punishment/jail	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
15	8	I agree. I have a cousin that went to jail before for stealing and he's the same.	1	78.0	70.0	14.0
15	9	Childhood tramua?	2	78.0	68.0	514.0
16	0	I didn't know that coal mining had such adverse effects on the environment. No wonder everyone wants green energy so badly...	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	1	I feel bad for the people and the wild life.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	10	Maybe it's a matter of corruption? Since the officials didn't even make good on their promises regarding money for the land and work for one of the landowners sons.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	11	Corruption and greed, but that is not just in India.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	12	True, so many other places mine coal still though, including America. Do you think our coal mines are this bad?	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	13	No, not as bad because of regulations, but I would not want to live next to one.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	14	That's true, I wonder what regulations can do to prevent all the ash though?	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	15	The way the coal in mined.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	16	That's good. One of the worst parts of that article was reading about the white ash covering everything. Reading about it might've been enough to give me cancer.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	17	Yeah, the woman losing her son was bad too.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	18	Yup. Do you think this article is old or basically present day?	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	19	Sadly, I think it present day.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	2	Yeah for sure. The people are going to get all sorts of health problems and the animals are so desperate for food that they are attacking humans.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	20	That's sad. I've read recently that India has started more recycling and other measures to take care of the enviroment.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	21	India is a big country. So it probably has good parts when it comes to environmental protections.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	22	Yeah, it's likely the cities that will start with the new reforms.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	23	The story was about capitalism as much it was about environmentalism	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	24	True. Squeeze all the money you can out of the land without caring about the people, animals or general environment until it's too late.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	25	You asked about mines in America. I believe this is how they were in the 1800s	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	26	Yeah and it was probably children working in there too.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	27	many people died because of black lung.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	28	It's a terrible way to die too. So much suffering. I wonder if the mine workers in India are suffering from that too?	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	29	I would think that they are.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	3	I can not believe how little they said they are going to pay the people for lost of land.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	30	It was nice talking to you about this unfortunate topic. Have a great day!	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	31	You have a great day too.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	32	bye	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	33	bye	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	4	Yeah, it did seem little but Indians don't really make much money daily, compared to western countries.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	5	That is true. I wonder what other animals besides the elephants are effected?	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	6	I imagine it's every animal in the surroundings. It's just that only elephants are big and strong enough to do something about it.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	7	It has to be really bad growing up next to the coal mine with the bad air quality.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
16	8	Yeah and the lack of water too. They spoke about their wells drying up.	1	336.0	81.0	15.0
16	9	Nothing seemed to be very regulated.	2	336.0	75.0	515.0
20	0	I thought this was a very sad situation, what did you think?	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	1	I think it is sad as well... Poor elephants	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	10	no, I could not, can yuo?	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	11	No... it would eat me alive	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	12	same here, I could not function	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	13	I don't get how people do it... they have to be mentally ill or unsound	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	14	yes or totally depraved	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	15	I hope it catches up to all of them and they have to go through some of the suffering they have put those people and animals through	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	16	karma will catch up to them I think	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	17	I hope so..... They deserve it	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	18	I hope so too.  This has been a good talk goodbye	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	19	bye	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	2	I was thinking poor people, but yes sad for them too	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	3	Well yes poor people too, it's sad all around. sad there isn't more help being given out	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	4	yeah the government should do something, it is ridiculous	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	5	Agreed... that is their job afterall	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	6	Yes, at least to make harsher penalties and laws about this	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	7	Yes, to deter it and to show people that it is wrong... It's sad what greed will do to people	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
20	8	yes all this just to turn a profit, with no regard for lives	1	336.0	73.0	19.0
20	9	Can you imagine living with yourself knowing you did that?	2	336.0	68.0	519.0
28	0	I felt very disturbed while reading the article about the family situations.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	1	Yeah for sure...Do you think you personally would return to Mosul if you were a Christian?	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	10	Not that drastic hopefully. Something more of a union maybe, versus army. The few that can defend land or people from Muslims. But I agree, not a major force.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	11	I think the internet is the only way to solve it. Once people talk to the other side and see they are just people like everyone else.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	12	I'm not sure. The internet and possibly media may not work beneficially.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	13	"The way I see it, is growing up their family and friends are constantly pounding into their heads, ""hate the west."" Then they go on a computer and play video games with American or European people and see that they aren't so bad. There's no reason to hate these people."	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	14	I can see that. But how is that going to get fixed. It's the elders opinion that would need to change.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	15	Yeah, once people are set in their ways, there's no changing their prejudices. You basically have to wait for the older people to die off...	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	16	It's a shame. They are hurting their own people instead of being able to move forward away from this crisis.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	17	Also I think it's only a small fraction of the fanatical Muslims that are to blame.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	18	Granted, that may be true. But that small fraction on both sides is hindering the whole situation.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	19	Yup. Anyway, it was really nice of France to welcome Christians that feared going back to Mosul.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	2	It's a hard question.  I feel obligated to return, but it's so dangerous.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	20	Oh of course. Maybe France could send some ally's back with them to help regrow.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	21	I doubt that any French people would volunteer for that...	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	22	There's not exactly much hope there. But if some of the Christians have been able to become close to the French, it may be a start.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	23	Yeah. Do you think America took in a lot of asylum seekers from this tragedy?	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	24	No, sadly America's own political stragedy prohibits too much outside assistance for that.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	25	I think they have a lottery for Christians from Middle Eastern countries.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	26	Some are allowed to come, but not nearly the amount that actually need help and assistance.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	27	Yeah but the amount of people that need help and assistance is far more people than we can handle. That's millions of people!	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	28	Agreed completely! America can't do that. I'm not on board with the complete denial. I think petitions are needed to keep the process flowing.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	29	Yeah, that makes sense. I hope in the next couple of generations the tension in the Middle East will finally be released.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	3	I agree, there would be a longing to fix the area and to prevent a similar disaster from happening again.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	30	goodbye	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	31	bye	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	4	Right, the whole town needs built again and the entire city is hurting from all the struggling. It would also be so hard to do alone. Would need a team that could agree.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	5	I don't even think they have the powers or the numbers to fix anything. They were a minority before all the bloodshed and they are losing members every day.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	6	Yeah, that's why no one could do it alone. I'd hope there would be a few strong willed individuals that may be able to start something and train others	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	7	It's a little like solving racism. What are the Christians really supposed to do? Tell the fanatical Muslims to not kill them because of their religion?	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
28	8	Which will never work. They'll do what they want and have been doing. Basically an army needs created, but they don't have the tools for that.	1	171.0	69.0	27.0
28	9	An army for what? Like an Israel vs the middle east situation? Where they basically stockpile weapons and a serious war could break out at any time.	2	171.0	81.0	527.0
29	0	I never thought about the painful memories keeping people from returning.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	1	Do you mean to like their homeland?	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	10	These stories are very sad and make me thankful for my life.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	11	For sure, it reminds me to take a step back and just be grateful for what I have	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	12	Totally	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	13	and the people who go to help, I'm sure they will struggle with what they saw/did etc for the rest of their life...	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	14	I would be. To be told to convert or die is the ultimate test of faith.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	15	Yes and they shouldn't have to make that kkind of choice over faith.. it's silly	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	16	Very silly to us, but some people do take their faith as life or death.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	17	Yes, which is their choice I guess	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	18	I believe, but I don't fault others for believing different from me.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	19	I don't either, everyone is entitled to their own opinion	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	2	Yes, after wars and what they have seen.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	20	It was very nice chatting with you! bye	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	21	bye	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	3	Yah.. I never really thought about it either but it makes total sense	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	4	How long before the middle east is put back together, I don't think it will be in our lifetime.	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	5	I agree... which is sad to think about. How long will those peopel continue to suffer? and the people trying to help suffering as well	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	6	Yeah it is very sad	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	7	and it could be fixed! There is the funds out there in the world, and the know how.	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
29	8	I agree with that	1	171.0	75.0	28.0
29	9	These stories just make me think/realize the massive gap that there is in the world	2	171.0	68.0	528.0
34	0	Hi; I thought the article was pretty accurate.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	1	I can relate to them in some ways I think	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	10	"Agreed. I don't believe they're really ""defending our freedom"" and I wish young kids would stop joining for the recognition."	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	11	Do you believe that's what it is? I think these young kids are tricked into joining	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	12	That, too. And bribed- crazy amounts of money, travel, free education...	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	13	They have no idea what they are fighting for, they are dying for a country that does not care about them	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	14	100%. I can't imagine just following someone else's orders blindly.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	15	I was sent to prison for 5 years for a crime that never even occured so I know this country is a joke	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	16	That's terrible. You definitely got a firsthand view. My secondhand view isn't very favorable, either.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	17	It was horrible being locked in a cage like an animal for something that never even happened	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	18	I imagine. That would be traumatizing.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	19	I can somewhat understand what soldiers go through being away from their families for so long	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	2	I can't even imagine what it would be like to be at war, or in the services in general.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	20	It would be really hard coming back and adjusting. And hard for the families, too, obviously.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	21	What I think is really sad is so many of them are homeless, I think it needs to be stopped, there is a man in my city that goes around and interviews the homeless and at least 70% are veterans...it makes no sense to me that they are homeless after fighting for out country but these nasty girls only have to have a baby thats a different color than them to get $12 a month appartments	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	22	I can't believe so many are homeless after making so much money while serving. Where does it go?	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	3	mental illness is horrible and they deserve help	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	4	I agree. We should take better care of our servicemen and women.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	5	They have done so much for us we owe it to them	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	6	We should also not enter needless wars and send them away unnecessarily. It's too common.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	7	Its all about money, it creates money so it will continue to happen	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
34	8	They're just pawns in a big political game.	1	386.0	68.0	33.0
34	9	It all needs to stop but we both know it will not	2	386.0	91.0	533.0
44	0	Oh man. I'm surprised this HIT brought up cancer. Thats such a huge and saddening topic.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	1	I always find it painful	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	10	That is a good point. I suppose getting told that you might be dying would make anyone think about their life and everything.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	11	It definitely will, but not so many people are willing to embrace it.	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	12	I guess religion also helps. If you are that kind of person of course. It's such a rough disease though. And we still use chemo. I wish we'd find some better treatments at least. When my dad went through chemo he got so much worse. Mentally and illness wise.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	13	Yeah, many people tend to shy away from that though. Religion is a huge factor.	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	14	My dad wasn't very religious so I guess all he saw was the end and that was it. I can't imagine going through cancer personally. You need a lot of strength to get through the treatments and still somehow have a positive outlook.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	15	I pray it wont be our portion. Guess we can exchange our byes now	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	16	We need 15 messages each. we are only halfway through. And likewise I surely hope neither of us, or anyone for that matter has to deal with it :(	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	17	Yeah. It is not a good phase. Do you know the cause though?	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	18	Of my dads cancer?	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	19	I mean cancers generally	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	2	It really is. I'm glad that woman in the article had sucha  positive outlook on it though. I've dealt with several family members getting cancer when I was a kid and there was a lot of suffering.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	20	Oh yea. Uncontrolled cell division because of a mutation in the genes that control how much a cell can divide and when that function turns off.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	21	Wow..what causes the uncontrolled cell division?	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	22	Pretty sure its a mutation in the DNA of the cell. Or is it the RNA? Been a hot minute since I learned all this stuff haha.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	23	Its never my forte. I dont like science	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	24	It's all good everyone has their interests c:	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	25	It is...Is there any habit that can prevent it?	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	26	Id assume not smoking, drinking, and wearing sunscreen is the best you can do	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	27	Wow...impressive. You know so much	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	28	Why thank you. Most of this I remember from the doctor talking to my dad.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	29	Nice. I will try and read more on it. Now this chat is getting too long. Can we please exchange our byes?	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	3	Yea, the woman is really a fighter. I love her. I lost an uncle to cancer last year	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	30	Yup it's time. It was a good chat. Hope the rest of your day is productive and smooth c:	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	31	You too. You have to type bye too	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	32	bye	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	4	I lost my dad last year to a brain tumor. And my Grandmother had a rare bone marrow cancer. You'd think with all the medical technology we have now adays we could find a cure wit hlike gene therapy or something.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	5	wow..that is sad. So sorry about that. Yea. I feel the pharmaceutical companies are deliberately keep it secret.	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	6	Honestly with the amount of money that is generated from cancer treatments and donations they probably are. God that would be absolutely horrible though.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	7	It really is pitiable. Its disturbing that human lives is not valued.	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
44	8	It really is. Very sad that people value currency over their fellow man. Back toa bout the woman though, I wonder what drives her to have such a positive outlook. My father was very depressed when he got ill, which is a very normal reaction. I just wonder what enabled this woman to be so optimistic about it all.	1	289.0	63.0	43.0
44	9	Might be a moment of self discovery for her.	2	289.0	85.0	543.0
45	0	what did you think about this article	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	1	it was interesting	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	10	It's so sad that people would rather see $$$ than human lives being saved and improved	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	11	its the price we pay for freedom	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	12	It shouldn't have to be thouh	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	13	i know but we the people are so dumbed down that the powers that be have free reign to terrorize us with evil greed and corruption but hey as long as I can watch the game on sunday whocares	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	14	There is too much of that mentatllity I agree, but that doesn't mean we should be punished by having treatments hidden from us for the sake of the rich getting richer	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	15	what can we do? nothing	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	16	We are pretty helpless	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	17	yes just wait for the inevitable war	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	18	what war?	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	19	world war 3 thats what they want to control the population	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	2	It was... cancer is such a sad subject no matter what	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	20	What do you think is going to cause that	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	21	probably an economic crisis first	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	22	That usually is a starter for it	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	23	yea nice chatting bye	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	24	bye	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	3	yes it is sad to see in anyone	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	4	I don't get why it has not been cured yet	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	5	probably deliberate	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	6	I think so too, because there is so so much money in it	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	7	the pharma companies make a killing why cure anything when you just treat it and keep you alive milk you till you die	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
45	8	I agree... Curing it would mean a big drop in profits for them... how awful is that	1	289.0	68.0	44.0
45	9	we are just dollar sign that's how capitalism works	2	289.0	78.0	544.0
52	0	Hey, I didn't realize that polar bears depended on the arctic ice so much for their hunting..	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	1	there isn't much else of anything up there. animal variety is pretty scarce	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	10	Yeah but beyond reversing global warming, I'm not sure how they can fix it. Maybe introduce new land animals for the polar bears to hunt?	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	11	like penguins? same issue with seals about swimming. there isn't a lot that can survive the temperatures. more than fix it at this point is stabilize and halt it	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	12	That's true but these animals wouldn't necessarily need to live long. Just long enough to wind up in the jaws of a hungry polar bear.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	13	we can be importing penguins annually. what country would take such a thankless job and cost	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	14	It would indeed be expensive. If the idea was floated to animal conservation groups, I think it could be funded.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	15	maybe i'm just a pessimist but the logistics just seems insane	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	16	Yeah there could be transportation issues. Acquiring the penguins would be the easy part. Right now I think the majority of polar bears are still surviving. If there was a possibility of them going extinct due to a lack of food, I have no doubt that we could save them, somehow.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	17	conservation efforts for near extinction tend to go to keeping them in zoos until the habitat can sustain them again	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	18	Have you ever seen a polar bear in a zoo? I'm not sure if I have.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	19	yea, i can't recall, but i have watched the live cams for them before. their enclosures are mostly big pools of water	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	2	Yeah but I thought of them as nimble creatures. Like an better version of a bear. And basically they way they hunt is by ambushing seals at ice openings.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	20	Yeah, I just googled it and there's lots of cool videos on youtube. Also sometimes they build big enclosures for one type of animal. There could be a polar bear national park or something in the arctic.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	21	them some brave people with money to go to one that far up north	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	22	Some animal animal conservation groups have deep pockets.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	23	i wonder if there are other studies not dealing with polar bears, but like the seals instead. (this is chat #12 for me. almost done)	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	24	Probably, getting grants for studying environmental problems are probably easier to acquire than for other subjects. I just googled some polar bear stuff and there was an article from 2018 talking about the problem. They said the main issue with low polar bear populations is inbreeding. Also they discussed Canada air dropping food and said it would cost 2 million a month.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	25	yea, if populations are low inbreeding is yet another issue. bad genes get a hold of the population. interesting that they even considered air dropping. i guess it only has to be in the active time of the year. so around 10 - 12 million	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	26	I think they're only going to drop food when they notice that the bears are starving. Also that 2 million was to just feed 5,000 polar bears.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	27	that's still have to be a lot of food. did they say what kind of meat? seal? where are they even getting it?	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	28	They might have, I was skimming it fast so I could've missed it. It's great that the Canadian government is doing something about it though. I bet our government is also taking steps to save the majestic animal. Thanks for the conversation, hope you have a good day.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	29	we both have to say bye	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	3	they are certainly the biggest type of bear, which always seem odd to me	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	30	bye	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	31	7	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	32	bye	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	4	Yeah and they definitely require a big food source.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	5	this article was very science oriented compared to others	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	6	Yeah, it'd have to be whenever NASA gets mentioned in an article lol.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	7	i think this kind of article are interesting, but they don't receive the same coverage as say the Polar Bear on the Coke bottles and cans during Christmas	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
52	8	I think the ice caps melting has been covered a lot. Al Gore kept talking about the polar bears in his first global warming movie.	1	49.0	81.0	51.0
52	9	been covered multiple times doesn't mean it is getting fixed though. the population is still in heavy decline	2	49.0	99.0	551.0
57	0	I think its sad the way elephants lack good protection	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	1	Yeah, it's really unfortunate that some countries value ivory so highly.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	10	i am sure there is a way thats a good idea actually.	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	11	Yeah. I think there was also another tactic they tried, which was painting the tusks pink or something.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	12	What do you think about these governments saying the elephants damage the crops	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	13	I've heard of those rampaging elephant stories in the past. What happens is that people keep cultivating land that elephants previous used. So the elephants are forced to interact with people to find food.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	14	Do you think the global community will step up and help?	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	15	Probably not, unless it becomes a really dire situation. The EU had their chance of really stepping up the penalties that poachers would face and they didn't take their chance.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	16	One can only hope for the best. I think that's our fifteen turns good job. Bye	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	17	It's supposed to be 10 turns each lol. Also I just googled what ivory went for....In 2016, they went for $1,500 a pound and they can weigh up to 250 pounds...Easy 400k.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	18	That price is only going to go up too	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	19	Yeah it's probably doubled since its getting harder and harder to sell it.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	2	it just goes to show money rules over all to this day	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	20	considering 140 k elephants have been killed between 2007 and 2014 it should be harder. And it is 15 turns just checked.	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	21	Yeah, I can't even imagine that many dead elephants...There was also the statistic that one gets killed very 15 minutes. Elephants are such smart creatures too, they have funerals for dead family members. It's so sad....Also the terms are on the left side, 10 turns minimum which we've reached or 15 turns each for a bonus.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	22	bye	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	23	bye	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	3	Yup. Were you surprised that the EU wasn't in favor of classifying all elephants as appendix 1?	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	4	yeah its weird an elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not the other as well	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	5	What's weird is that they think poachers care about imaginary lines when they're already committing a crime.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	6	these poachers never face any repercussion	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	7	They are really well equipped too, they are almost like soldiers now. I think the article said that poachers fire on sight when encountered.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
57	8	yeah the criminal networks are really organized and fluid	1	72.0	71.0	56.0
57	9	If only there was a way to devalue Ivory, so there wasn't any point in killing elephants. I remember reading an article a long time ago when groups tried to flood the ivory market with fakes to lower prices.	2	72.0	81.0	556.0
59	0	what did you think about the article	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	1	I think it's very sad... hbu	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	10	Maybe other countriescan step in at this point. Im sure if puttingsanctions on africa for enouraging poaching would stop the problems alltogether.	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	11	"Im sure they could... but lots of people dont even see it as an issue... it's ""just an animal"""	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	12	so sad but true elephants are really smart and really important to the eco system that theyre in, so going extinct would be a huge loss	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	13	it would be! And it would just be an awful step for humanity, killing off another species	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	14	yea another thing humans ruinon earth. you would think scientist would see this as a bigger issue	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	15	I think they probably do but they don't have much pull	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	16	true, if you have money you have control of the world. and its the animals that suffer from these greedy people	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	17	it's awful that that is the way the world works	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	18	thanks for talking with me. i love animals and espiecally elephants so much i hope that they never go extinct. goodbye	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	19	you as well bye	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	2	i think its really sad too i love elephants andthey deserve to be protected	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	3	me too. All animals do! It's scary to think about them going extinct	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	4	I cant believe they cant do more to protect them. There has to be a way	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	5	Im sure they can, i bet they aren't for financial gain or something	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	6	yea maybe theyre being swayed by some kind of hunting group. I wonder if more animal conservation groups spoke uptherewould be some kind ofway to protect them.	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	7	Probably, if enough people rallied against it they could make a change for the better	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
59	8	i also think that maybe the african government encourages poaching. It may be one of the biggest draws to their country.It probably helps them a lot economically.	1	72.0	96.0	58.0
59	9	That is a good side of it, that very well could be... How sad really. Encouraging killing endangered animals for $$	2	72.0	68.0	558.0
67	0	That article really made me emotional...It's so sad when children are bullied and aren't able to fix the situation.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	1	Me too. Hopefully some of the things that they are doing will help children.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	10	Yeah, so really the only difference between youth of today and past generations being able to deal with being bullied is the internet and social media.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	11	They can not escape the bullying	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	12	Sometimes a good teacher can save children in this situation. They just have to notice it and discipline the other kids early.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	13	That is true but sometimes a teacher can be part of the problem. I make sure my children know they are loved everyday and home is their safe space.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	14	That's truly horrifying if a teacher takes part in the bullying. Good job on making sure your children have a good self esteem.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	15	I think any adult seeing a child suffer should step in and help.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	16	That's true. Other adults are really the only ones who can do something about it. Outside of a parent complaining.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	17	Plus teach your children to respect others.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	18	Yeah, that's simply good parenting. Also I remember all the shows that I would watch as a little kid always had lessons. They tried to imprint on you to not hurt others or steal or anything else bad. TV shows are probably why I never seriously bullied anyone.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	19	TV shows really did have better messaging about those kind of things.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	2	Yeah. In the article they said that France was lagging behind Sweden and a couple other countries, I bet America is lagging behind France.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	20	Do you think today's tv shows that target youth aren't as educational as in the past? (do you want to keep going or end?)	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	21	Shows did a better job in the past in my opinion. It was very nice chatting with you!	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	22	bye	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	23	bye	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	3	I agree, but it is a hard issue to deal with.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	4	It's almost an impossible issue to deal with. Every kid has a cell phone and social media. So there's the potential for them to be bullied 24/7.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	5	I feel bad for the children and the parents. I have four children and it would break my heart to know they felt like there was no escape.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	6	Yeah, especially if you think about what kind of a dark mindset you need to be in to actually want to commit suicide as a child. It's hard to imagine that level of suffering.	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	7	Your right about social media playing a large role now days.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
67	8	Do you think a little bullying is needed to build a strong enough character to deal with reality as you grow older?	1	138.0	81.0	66.0
67	9	I think everybody will deal with something that is part of life.	2	138.0	75.0	566.0
68	0	Have you ever been bullied?	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	1	I have in the past. Have you?	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	10	No, not in any kind of administrative capacity. But, I think that it could potentially be very effective. The modern world has a way of distorting the best of intentions though.	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	11	How do you mean?	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	12	Well, an emotional support could potentially become an emotional detriment if a child chose to betray another child's confidence either maliciously or by complete accident.	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	13	I see. That is a something completely possible. I can see adults playing a better role for emotional support within the classroom. Perhaps having an assigned adult per classroom or something of that sort.	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	14	"Right, when I was in elementary school we had parent volunteers called ""den mothers"" (our school mascot was a lion) who shared their information with children and provided a sympathetic ear. I'd actually be interested to see what a normal day at a public school looks like these days."	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	15	We had something similar in elementary as well. Except, from what i remember, they were teachers assistants. They did the typical TA duties but were there as well to provide emotional support. I am curious too how a normal day is at a public school.	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	16	I mean, my youngest brother is now home schooled and I know that people who can afford it now send their children to private schools. The devaluation of public education in the US has been profound and embarrassing.	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	17	I was homeschooled for high school. As a teen i absolutely hated it at first but now that i am older i have come to appreciate it. Public education is definitely not where is should be. I wish the government would make education a focus. It's been busy on other things of course.	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	18	I went to a boarding school for two years in high school. I also absolutely hated it at the time but looking back I was healthier than I had ever been in my life up to that point. I enjoyed chatting with you! bye	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	19	Bye. Thanks!	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	2	Not intensely, that I can remember. There was one older kid on the bus that gave me the business sometimes, but we ended up being friends after a time. How did you respond to being bullied?	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	20	"""bye"" has to be all lowercase"	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	21	bye	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	3	I can relate to that. I was not severely bullied. It was off and on through elementary and some of middle school. In those moments of being bullied, i would usually ignore it. I was a resilient kid. Are you still friends with that person?	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	4	Haha, no. That was over 15 years ago. Do you have any ideas on the appropriate response to widespread bullying?	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	5	I think it depends. I think the bully that happens today is a bit different from the kind many experienced back then. Also, kids that get bullied today, their response to bullying varies.	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	6	I understand that, but there are a limited amount of ways to respond to verbal and physical abuse. I don't think that the way children respond varies much from when we were children. I think the key difference is that bullying doesn't end just because you're home from school. It can be something that haunts you around the clock day in and day out.	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	7	Yes, that's what i meant. Bullying does not end even when you're home. What do you think would be an appropriate response to bullying?	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
68	8	Unplugging, first and foremost. I don't participate in social media, but I think that it has been an overwhelmingly negative influence on society. The reason that children go to the lengths that this French girl did is because they feel absolutely alone in their suffering. Inclusion is the answer. Something as simple as assigning each child a emotional support classmate could do wonders for kids who are being singled out.	1	138.0	74.0	67.0
68	9	That is true. Social media has made a great impact on younger generations. I cannot imagine the impact it would have had on me as a kid. I do agree that inclusion is important and vital. I have never thought of the idea of assigning emotional support classmates. That is an absolutely great idea. Have you seen this used in the real world?	2	138.0	62.0	567.0
82	0	I wish there was more details...How/Why did they fall off a cliff??	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	1	I was thinking the same thing. Maybe the weather was a factor	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	10	Yeah, I didn't realize the full scope of what you meant by foul play. They could've been robbed/killed and then just tossed off a cliff.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	11	We are just speculating. I wish there were more details. I was also curious about what failure the helicopter experienced	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	12	Yeah, that seemed really unlucky. The father/son must've survived the cliff fall though. Otherwise why was the helicopter issue relevant?	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	13	It seemed like negligence to me. I don't think the helicopter was well maintained	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	14	I don't know if I'd go that far. Just bad luck...Airplanes are really well maintained and they still have all sorts of problems that result in delays.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	15	OK. Also what kind of safety measures were implemented near the cliff? Did the trail lead directly to it?	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	16	I'd hope the trail didn't lead to it. Maybe they weren't on a trail and were just hiking? It'd be nice if the local government put fencing or something around where they fell, so this doesn't happen again. Also it's strange that the article didn't talk about the part of their family that survived this tragedy and are grieving now.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	17	I would agree about the fencing. Yes I wonder how the mother is coping and/or any siblings.	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	18	I wonder if they're thinking that if they also went on this trip, they could've prevented this...Just an all around sad situation.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	19	They might be thinking about suing the county or state.	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	2	Maybe a really powerful snow storm so they didn't have visibility?	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	20	Maybe. Especially if the father/son were still alive and potentially could've been treated at a hospital if not for the helicopter issues. Or maybe the local government could be blamed for not maintaining the trail they were on (do you want to continue or end)?	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	21	Both are equally valid in my opinion. I was also wondering if any other people have fallen off that particular cliff	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	22	Yeah, it would've been nice to see some statistics regarding falls/fatalities in the area but once again, the article failed us...	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	23	Also how steep was the cliff? How far did they fall?	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	24	We can assume that it was steep enough to do some serious damage. How do you think people were alerted to this accident?	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	25	That is a great question. That's one of the reasons I suspect foul play. The last person with victim(s) is usually the first suspect	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	26	And there had to be someone who called it in, unless the father or son were in good enough condition to dial 911.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	27	It could have been another hiker. The call would have to have been made shortly after the fall since the rescue helicopter was dispatched	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	28	Yeah, I wonder if this was a popular hiking destination? Also I wonder what kind of evidence there would be if foul play occurred? Maybe branches broken in weird ways that show a struggle occurred?	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	29	There should be plenty of evidence. I doubt they went off that cliff willingly	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	3	Well it was in California, so I am not so sure about that	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	30	bye	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	31	goodbye	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	4	There's snow on mountains there tho! Good place to ski/snowboard.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	5	I was also wondering if there was any foul play	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	6	I really doubt that. How exactly would that happen? Like in a cartoon, someone switched a sign or something so they walked straight off a cliff??	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	7	There could have been someone that has not yet been discovered who was involved somehow	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
82	8	Do you think they might've been pushed? My first thought was the son might've slipped or something and the father was unable to pull him up. So they both fell.	1	353.0	81.0	81.0
82	9	I would not rule it out. It just seems too strange to me that two perfectly sensible people just fell off a cliff	2	353.0	79.0	581.0
86	0	I've actually experienced this phenomenon second hand and it's just heart breaking.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	1	Wow, that's terrible. How old was the child?	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	10	The world can be painted in very different lights depending on where you are getting your information. The lens through which your world is perceived is much more easily manipulated when you are a child. Do you have any ideas about how to curb online harassment?	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	11	The only solution I think can think of is to monitor your child's internet use. That is way overbearing though. Maybe in the future, AI could be trained to monitor these kinds of problems.	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	12	I suppose it's a possibility, but AI is still its infancy. I think the article had a point when it mentioned that listening to your child and actually having a functional and supportive relationship with them is the greatest deterrent. So many children get home from school and just plug into the television or their telephone.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	13	Yeah but it really takes patience and persistence. I remember not really wanting to talk to my parents about school related things even though I had a good relationship with them. Somehow ensuring that your children have a good friend network would also be important. They shouldn't ever feel alone in the problems their having.	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	14	Patience and persistence should be requirements for anyone to become a parent. You can definitely be a refuge for your children without being overbearing.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	15	"That's true but you need to suffer through many monotonous conversations. ""How was school?"" ""Good."" Times that by 1,000 until the kid needs advice about something."	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	16	"I'm not a parent, so it's quite easy for me to armchair quarterback, but I think a little nuance will go a long way. ""How's so and so? Did you see * today?"" Is your english teacher still a jerk? Etc."""	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	17	Yeah, I'm just seeing through the kid perspective and the kinds of conversations I had with my parents. I just wanted them to be over so I could talk about what I wanted to talk about. Something needs to be done though, as car accident fatalities and homicides went down but suicides went up...	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	18	I agree. I think that mental health resources for pre-teens could also have a positive affect on this issue. Well, Thanks for chatting! bye	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	19	Yeah and perhaps there could be a technology solution. Hold on a sec, need 10 turns!	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	2	He was only 12. Apparently, he hung himself after being punished by his father for misbehaving.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	20	Yep, that was your tenth one! bye	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	21	bye	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	3	That's so sad. Do you know if the punishment was a one time thing or if the child was often disciplined?	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	4	I don't know the details; and i'm not one to make assumptions, but it rang true when the article mentioned that these types of suicide are often impulsive decisions made rashly in emotional circumstances.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	5	Yeah and with the internet, it's really easy for a kid to google to find out a suicide method.	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	6	I think it serves as more than just a resource for methods at this point. Children are exposed to so much on the internet these days it is difficult for me to fathom.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	7	Yup, kids grow up sooooooo much faster than in previous generations because of our media.	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
86	8	Not to mention round the clock exposure to bullies, creeps and the sorry state of the world at large.	1	304.0	74.0	85.0
86	9	I don't think the world is in that much of a sorry state. This is probably the best time to ever be alive. It's just news is constantly doom and gloom. Bullying is probably one of the biggest reasons for children suicide.	2	304.0	81.0	585.0
92	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	1	"It was honestly disgusting. The women managed to survive one atrocity and now are being mistreated by the same people who ""saved"" them."	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	10	I guess i meant to say here in America. I wonder if there's anything people can do to help this situation	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	11	I think part of their group is aligned with ISIS and to my knowledge, ISIS is barely alive after losing so much territory.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	12	Great. These crazy groups need to all disappear lol	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	13	Yeah but it takes a lot of killing to make them disappear. It's a good thing Trump was so motivated to finally end their terror.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	14	Agreed. I think majority are wiped out though. Let's hope for a better future.	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	15	Yeah. Also we need to strengthen some areas in the middle east so they aren't as easily destroyed if a new ISIS like group is formed.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	16	Do you think USA should meddle in foreign affairs though?	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	17	That's a tough question. It could be argued that ISIS even existed in the first place because of the power vacuum we left in Afghanistan and Iraq when we supplanted their governments. I honestly think we should quit being the world police for a while until most problems in America are solved. So much money was spent in the middle east in the past 20 years.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	18	I can agree with that. We definitely have issues here that are more important. Well it was nice talking to you!	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	19	Yeah, we have plenty of issues here!! Nice talking to you as well, bye.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	2	I agree. Just thinking about the women who got impregnated by these terrible soldiers makes me sad.	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	20	bye	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	3	Yup. And those women must've trusted those soldiers too, out of desperation. And 2.5 million people were displaced!! Such a terrible situation.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	4	I wonder how those children grew up. It's a terrible situation for the moms as well as the children that were born	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	5	They probably grew up knowing nothing except constant battle and death. Just trying to survive another day...	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	6	Just imagine what the fathers are going through.... man.	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	7	Their fathers were probably dead or fighting against Boko Haram. It's such a sad situation.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
92	8	Yeah. I'm so glad we don't have any of these issues in modern times	1	233.0	70.0	91.0
92	9	Isn't this basically modern times in Africa? This is still a big issue. Boko Haram still exists.	2	233.0	81.0	591.0
93	0	The sad part is that its Nigeria and there will be no justice for these raped women.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	1	Yea that is really really messed up. The people committing these crimes should pay for them. Sexual abuse is no joke at all and I hate that those women have to go through it with no hope..	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	10	Yeah its hard to help people that don't help themselves.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	11	I just hate that people have to deal with that stuff in general. Like I wish we as a species could get past the whole oversexualization thing. Like I get it's biological but damn no means no. Keep it in your pants ya dig?	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	12	Yeah its hard for some guys to do that	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	13	Yea we had a big case here a couple of years ago where a cop was going around raping women. It was really messed up but he got thrown in jail for it.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	14	at least some justice was made there but then again it was in a country where justice can be made sometimes.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	15	"Sad that it's only ""sometimes,"" but I guess that is better than never. It just sucks that people ahve to suffer around the world because of this crap."	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	16	unfortunately we cant fix other countries which sucks	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	17	Yea it really does. You would think they would try to improve but I guess the people in power enjoy what they got going on.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	18	I'm assuming you know more about the subject and would know much more about this but as a man I can also sympathize with rape victims I can only imagine the feeling like no one is listening	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	19	Yea it is pretty rough; it's evenw orse as a man because a lot of people think that because you are a man you can't be raped. Especially if you are sexually abused by a woman.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	2	Yeah I read they were raped by camp leaders which makes it worse	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	20	yeah people think its fine if its a woman doing the raping	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	21	Which it for sure isnt. Like if I don't want it it is the same as if ai woman doesn't want it. Doesn't help that it was in high school either at a time in my life where I was heavily depressed. Of course no one wants to lsisten to a high school kid about that though; especially in the bible belt.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	22	i was always scared as a catholic to go to church as a kid and would always talk my mom out of going which probably turned out to save me in the long run	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	23	How Ironic my family is catholic too!	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	24	That's cool! haha	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	25	Yea they were really hush hush about my issues. Kinda sucked; kinda forced religion on me but it is what it is.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	26	man that just sucks. I dont wanna get into details but I wish more would've been done to help you out.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	27	Well now that I'm an adult i got the help I needed so it worked out in the end. It was just rough for a while.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	28	That's great to know!	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	29	Yea I'm glad to be a functioning member of society now haha. I just wish those poor women in nigera could get the same amount of help I did. It isn't fair.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	3	It really does. Rape in general is just one of those unforgivable things and it sickens me that people are barbaric enough to commit it.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	30	yeah man we dont see how lucky we are to be born here	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	31	True that.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	32	Its been a good talk mturk friend! I think we did more than we needed haha. Goodbye.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	33	bye	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	4	Yeah as a man, I couldn't live with myself knowing I raped a woman.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	5	Likewise, and I've been sexually abused before so I somewhat know what they are going through; not the hopelessness but the pain..	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	6	Thats terrible sorry to hear about that. I have people in my family who have also been abused and it is just depressing to think about.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	7	"Yea people are really messed up. Luckily i got the help I needed but those poor women have to endure it.. I don't like that our country is the ""wold police"" but those rapists deserve a bullet real talk."	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
93	8	Yeah these girls live in a country with no justice or rape resources.	1	233.0	71.0	92.0
93	9	I mean I'm all for helping countries get more developed but some of them just don't want too. And honest people ahve to suffer because of it.	2	233.0	63.0	592.0
96	0	I think it is really sad that those animals had to suffer. Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo in one of the most war torn areas in the middle east?	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	1	Yeah...I don't necessarily think the violence in the area had much to do with the terrible conditions in the zoo. The zoo owners cared more about profit than the conditions of the animals.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	10	It always brings a smile to my face when people go out of their way to help animals in need. I used to volunteer at a shelter her ein my city. I love helping out rescued animals.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	11	That's commendable. If I had saw this though, I doubt I would've done anything. Most people would only go as far as complaining on social media. While this guy is having diplomatic talks with three different countries while navigating missiles and manages to rescue the animals!	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	12	Yea that guys is legit going the distance. Truely a champion. It takes a lit of courage and resolve to go through all of that. I have never personally gone out and rescuded the animals, but I always groomed them, fed them, and made sure they could find a great home. I don't think I could pull a rescue operation in a warzone. I'd for sure crumble under the stress.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	13	You must've really wanted to adopt some of those animals too. It's so easy to get attached to them! And who knows, if America was a warzone, maybe you would've done something similar like this guy.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	14	I did adopt one actually haha! Best dog I've ever had. His owner had left him abandoned in a shed with no food for 3 weeks. Apparently used to beat him because he gets scared if you raise your hands. was really a mess when he came in but now hes the happiest boy you've ever seen.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	15	Yeah, I've read about cases like that so often on Imgur. You just give them a little love and they are whole new animals.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	16	Oh yea a little bit of tlc goes a long way. Animals just wanna live and be loved.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	17	And the sad thing is, even if you mistreat a dog so badly...They will still forgive you. And animal's ability to forgive far exceeds a humans.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	18	Yea it is really sad. A dog will always be loyal. A blessing but also a curse. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt this dog; he is so sweet. But then again I can't see why anyone would abuse an animal. It's just wrong on so many levels.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	19	Some people are so wounded inside that the only way they can cope is to wound something else, that is equally as powerless. Anyway, I hope that tiger is still roaming that sanctuary today. Also it would be nice if the guy from the article manages to set up that animal area in the Gaza strip that the article mentioned. It was nice talking to you.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	2	That is for sure true; I just think the location for sure doesn't help. Either way though animals shouldn't have to suffer like that.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	20	Yea I hope that tiger can live out the rest of it's days peacefully. And likewise!	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	21	bye	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	22	bye	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	3	The owners just weren't equipped, knowledge wise, for this task. I don't think the tiger being fed chicken all its life was a consequence of the area. The owners were just clueless and blamed the conflict for their inadequacy. And I agree, the animals are always innocent and I hope they are enjoying themselves right now!	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	4	This reminds me of another article I read for one of these HITs maybe 3 days ago; but there was another zoo where people were feeding the tigers mango because they couldn't afford to feed them meat. It was in Venezuela :(	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	5	I can slightly understand that issue though. People in Venezuela have enough problems feeding themselves! It's truly a dire situation over there.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	6	Yea. Maybe it was greed at the pollitical level, but for sure not the zoo. I don't understand though why people feel the need to get exotic animals even though they cant properly take care of them; especially a zoo. People are really messed up when it comes to flipping a profit. Even the japanese are exploiting animals again for cash; they started whaling again. Well technically they never stopped but now it is official on paper again.	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	7	Speaking of poaching, I had an article about elephant tusks a couple days back. And I later googled that elephant tusks go for around 400k. And in poor areas in Africa, that's basically lottery money. And at that point, I'm not sure you can even blame the poachers. You blame the people who are buying the ivory and elephant parts for ancient medicine stuff. It's disgusting that they think elephant or whale parts will affect diseases.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
96	8	Holy crap they are worth that much? Man that is so wrong. No wonder the problem is so persistant if the market is that good. Such a shame though. And yea I don't understand how some rhino horn can treat the common cold. That's just needless slaughter. Oh don't get me started on shark-fin soup either...	1	57.0	63.0	95.0
96	9	That price was from an article in 2016. And since they've outlawed the sale of all ivory, the price has probably doubled or tripled. The people who are hunting these amazing animals are decked out like soldiers...Anyway, this article really inspired me. A guy saw that animals were being mistreated and immediately started planning on how to save them.	2	57.0	81.0	595.0
101	0	Hi	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	1	Hello there. That article is kinda messed up huh. I think it is a shame that a lot of these people end up dying trying to get to a better place.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	10	it sucks that politics on both sides make it impossible for common sense solutions	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	11	Indeed. Both sides are usually on the extremes and no one wants to meet in the middle. Meanwhile people end up suffering.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	12	it's weird though,i feel like i sometimes experience both extremes within myself....i want immigrants/migrants to come in the proper way but it's awful seeing people dying when all they want is a better life	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	13	Likewise, I feel like we need reform, but people trying to get in and getting hurt sucks. Like if the system wasn't so bad I feel like people would just try to get in officially instead of sneaking in. But you never know. There isn't an esy solution.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	14	i guess that's a big issue,the offical immigration process itself...my parents immigrated from croatia and from what they've told me, i know it isn't the easiest thing in the world	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	15	Yea the process is hard, and long. I guess that is why people just try to sneak in. Sometime sthey can't afford to wait for all the red tape.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	16	i guess in an ideal world they wouldn't even have to leave their countries....i'm sure they'd rather stay	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	17	Yea true that. It is pretty sad to beging with that people have to leave their homes because of the pollitical/economic climate their home country has.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	18	and we can't really help on that front either...since you know,our foreign involvements don't usually end up going very well,lol	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	19	Yea the whole world police schtick hasn't been working out very well for us.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	2	it's unfortunate	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	20	you can say that again  (i think we're at 10 turns each..are we good to go?)	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	21	Yea we are at 10.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	22	well,it was good talking to you,interesting conversation!....good bye	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	23	bye!	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	3	You'd think they'd try to set some official migration routes or something. It is saddening that women and children have to risk their lives crossing the sea.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	4	right,i think European leaders need to make up their minds one way or another,either officially state that you will not allow them in OR provide them safe passage	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	5	Exactly. A lot of needless death and risk. I can't imagine being stuck in a rickety overcrowded boat in the middle of the ocean.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	6	yea,i can imagine how terrible the conditions must be	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	7	Yea. I wonder why they haven't tried doing anything about it yet honestly. It is clearly a problem.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
101	8	"i guess they are just worried about the implications of seemingly ""Allowing"" the migrants,so they are stuck in this dangerous quasi place where the migrants have the incentive but are still unsure enough where it's not 100 percent sure thing"	1	67.0	59.0	100.0
101	9	Yea that makes sense. We are currently going through that immigration struggle as well. It's just a messed up situation in both places.	2	67.0	63.0	600.0
104	0	The migrant situation all around the world seems to be in shambles but having 4,000+ people go missing in one area should not ever happen.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	1	Yeah, it's a shame. There must be a safer way to transport these people than them having to take their chances on an overcrowded boat.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	10	Pay their total living costs for years to come? I would imagine that these people will be able to contribute towards their cost of living with skills and labor. The government being on the hook is my point exactly when I say that the host country's citizens are against this. I see way more reports about opposition to immigration compared to acceptance.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	11	Some people will likely be educated enough to support themselves. I think the majority would need assistance for quite a while. Housing assistance, education assistance, food assistance ect will be required for these people to survive. A few years ago Germany offered to pay migrants a full years worth of rent costs to return home. They also offered to give a lump sum for the migrants to open a business in their home country. This migration and the costs assorted with it are why some Europeans are electing conservative politicians. It's entirely why brexit happened, as the EU was forcing countries to accept migrants.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	12	Exactly why I say that the larger problem/major cause as to why over 4k people have been lost is due to the larger view many have against immigration. Many of these people would be able to perform basic labor jobs. They could benefit the host country's rather than be a drain if utilized correctly.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	13	4k people have been lost because the people are desperate. And even if the boat idea doesn't seem like a good one, they will take that chance anyway. Some countries have problems with immigration but others, like Germany, are still accepting people with open arms. The EU in general is still pro immigration. And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket. And I think you're underestimating how difficult it will be for these people to assimilate. Maybe it's different in others places but I highly doubt I could get a job anywhere if I couldn't speak the language.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	14	I would hope that the earlier migrants would be able to help people assimilate or they can create mini communities as we have in the USA. These things take time I guess and the EU is in the beginning stages in some country's. I guess I underestimate the difficulty as I see tons of immigrants in the US find work when they arrive.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	15	Yeah, it's easier to assimilate here as no matter what ethnicity you are, there's pockets of that group of people living together in every major city.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	16	I think private businesses offering transportation may be able to lessen the deaths during the migration rather than depend on governments.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	17	Maybe if it was a massive, massive company like Apple or Amazon. Even then, I doubt it would happen if the company was publicly traded. They'd get rid of that CEO ASAP. It would have to be the government as they would rightfully take losses to protect the lives of people. I don't think it's that crazy to ask the EU to help transport these people. Unless the representatives of the countries are only virtue signaling and don't actually want to accept the people.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	18	Optimally it would be private company's paid for by the governments so I guess that would be the same as the EU paying the bill/taking on the responsibility.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	19	That sounds like a good solution. I'm hoping that the article was a bit old and migrants aren't drowning as often now-a-days. It was nice talking to you, have a good night. bye	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	2	I can imagine that would not be difficult. Seems like this stems from a larger view that people have against immigration at this time.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	20	you as well. bye	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	3	I'm not certain this has anything to do with immigration because the countries they are fleeing to will accept them. Even the coyotes or whoever these people are paying to transport them to different countries are misleading them. As in the article, it said that the leaders of these trips are saying that if you get saved, they will take you back to Libya.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	4	I guess there are limited paths that can be taken from Africa where I guess they are fleeing. A land path would be a lot safer but I do not think countries would allow these immigrants to travel through them. That is why I said it was an immigration problem.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	5	Yeah, that's true. I didn't consider that. I think a land trip would be even more perilous. It would take longer and the already poor people would need more supplies. And how are they going to carry those supplies?	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	6	I'm not sure. I guess they would need assistance. Rather than being transported on boats, buses or trains could be used.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	7	As mentioned in the article regarding the rescue boats, I think the responsibility of transporting these people should go to the country that's willing to accept them. I don't think the cost would be that exorbitant.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
104	8	I can't imagine any country willing to take on that task. I can imagine that a lot of the citizens would voice opposition. Most reports that I have seen speak of citizens barely wanting to accept migrants let alone foot the bill for transportation.	1	67.0	60.0	103.0
104	9	That doesn't make sense, as the countries that receive these people are going to pay their living costs for years. Coming off that boat, these people will only have the clothes on their back. They will likely also need to be taught the local language. The big problem with immigration is the government in on the hook for the needs of the people for a long time.	2	67.0	81.0	603.0
106	0	So what did you think about the people and their situation with the water?	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	1	Honestly I think it is pretty messed up that the company in charge of the mining accident aren't cleaning up the polution effectively.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	10	Hm i have no knowledge of that at all but yeah, i hope noone got sick or died from that.	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	11	Same. Although theya re smart to not drink that water. That can cause a lot of problems down the line.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	12	Do you think you would ever donate to a cause like that to help the people?	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	13	Of course. As long as the money is actually going to help.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	14	Agreed. I'm pretty sure people and celebrities have donated a ton to Flint but yet, they're still in the same position.	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	15	Yea, makes you wonder where all that money is going.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	16	I'll be thinking about that before i go to sleep tonight lol. Nice talking to you!	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	17	We aren't done yet; it is 10 messages each. This message is the 9th :) But yea either way companies should totally be held accountable for their pollution.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	18	Oh sorry about that. I counted the code as a line. Do you think it has anything to do with the climate changing causing the mud slide	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	19	You know it is possible but it could also be a man made disaster. Either way im surprised there were no precautions in place to keep the waste from getting in the river in general.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	2	It's messed up. So you mainly think the company should pay for all the damages?	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	20	Yeah, it's a terrible situation overall. Freak accident.. kinda	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	21	Yea I just hope things improve for those people, and the wildlife.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	22	Yup. Fingers crossed!	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	23	Well we are at 10 now if you wanna stop	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	24	okay. It was nice talking to you! Hope you didn't think i was trying to leave early because i didn't want to talk to you lol	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	25	No no it's all good haha.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	26	bye !	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	27	bye	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	3	Well at the very least I think they should make more of an effort to help better the situation. After all it is their mess that is impacting the lives of a lot of people that live off the river. Well lived. They can't really live off of it that well now anyways.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	4	True. I don't remember if i read it, but i hope there weren't any casualties in this situation.	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	5	I don't recall if there were any human casualties, but tons of wildlife for sure. The local environment there must be incredibly messed up from all that polluted water.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	6	Definitely. I'm sure that affects the whole ecosystem as well. Sort of reminds me of Flint	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	7	Isn't Flint still messed up? Or did they ever resolve that situation	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
106	8	It's still messed up from what i've seen on television and articles that i've read. :(	1	134.0	70.0	105.0
106	9	Man thats sad. The water supply getting borked messes up so much stuff. I wonder what kind of pollutants were in that mining waste. I know gold miners us emercury to form an amalgam with the gold to catch it from the panning machines. I hope it isnt a ton of heavy metals/mercury in that river.	2	134.0	63.0	605.0
115	0	Man the situation in the middle east is a mess. Not sure why we always have to pick a side but lots of needless death for sure.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	1	I agree why cant we learn to get along peacefully?	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	10	Yea, My cousin was in desert storm and lost a leg and all of his friends/squad in an ied explosion.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	11	oh my goodness. How awful for him.	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	12	Yea he also got cancer from all the chemicals they used :(	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	13	Dang that is just horrible. I feel so bad for our military. I mean I'm so thankful and proud for what they do but I also feel so sorry for what they see and go through	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	14	Yea true that. They do their job for all of us, even if it isn't for the best reason	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	15	They do. I'm glad they do because its not something I could ever do	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	16	Apologies for the slow response My dog had an accident I had to clean. Anyway, the whole middle east is messed up. Why do they keep fighting eachother anyway?	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	17	thats okay! I don't know. I wish I had answers. I wish everyone would just get along	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	18	Me too. We just need to stay out of the worlds business and focus on improving our own country.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	19	I agree. Our own country has messes of its own that we need to focus on cleaning up.	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	2	That and why do we ahve to act like the world police? Not everything is our problem.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	20	For sure. Can we start with Healthcare please? That need a big clean up.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	21	yes! we need to take care of healthcare, taxes, etc and just let everyone else take care of themselves	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	22	For sure! anyway, it's been a good convo fellow turker! goodbye!	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	23	you too! Thank you! bye	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	3	I don't know we always have to get involved in everything. Thats part of the worlds problem. If we just stayed out maybe things wouldn't get so bad	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	4	I just think it is all a waste. We throw soldiers at wars we shouldn't even be involved in just to flex. It's pretty dumb.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	5	Seriously. Its such a waste of our money. We're the ones paying for it yet we get no say	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	6	Yep. And we end up dealing with everyone elses problems	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	7	Do you think we'll ever just stay out of stuff? lol	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
115	8	Honestly probably not. I wish we would but it's doubtful we ever will.	1	45.0	63.0	114.0
115	9	its so sad so many had to lose their lives needlessly	2	45.0	77.0	614.0
121	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	1	I think it is a greatidea to host an exhibit to try and educate people on what these migrants have to go through. It saddens me though that people have to go through struggles like this and drop everything though just to escape with their lives to a better place.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	10	Yeah, the conditions they're keeping these children in when detained.. terrible	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	11	It's just really messed up when you start treating actual people like less than human.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	12	Seriously, we have no right to treat others that way. These people are still human at the end of the day.	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	13	Exactly. These are real people, just like us. But of course our president doesn't see that all he sees are colours in his crayon box that he doesn't like.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	14	Let's hope the future changes for the better. So you do think that we should have a class that specifically teaches empathy?	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	15	Well again I don't think you can teach empathy; but just educate people on the experiences and feelings of others.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	16	That's a good idea. Nothing wrong with putting the good out there.	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	17	Yea like I said earlier, a little education never hurts. Not everyone will give a damn but the decent people will.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	18	I wonder if there's anyway we can help these immigrants	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	19	Well a better immigration policy would probably help. If they could go through the official process easier they wouldn't have to sneak in and risk their lives.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	2	I agree it's terrible. Do you think you can really teach empathy though?	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	20	Let's hope our next president looks more into this issue. Well it was nice talking to you!	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	21	Yes lets hope. And likewise! Have a great rest of the workday fellow turker :)	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	22	bye	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	23	goodbye!	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	3	Hmm I'm not sure. You can teach/mimic the feelings that these people got hrough; but that doesn't mean for certain that someone will still feel empathy towards them.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	4	I agree. I think it doesn't matter how much you teach someone empathy, if they were born with no empathy.. i'm not sure if these classes will change them.	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	5	Yea some people just do not care about their fellow man no matter what. It is still good though to expose the general populous to the lives of these people though; Some education never hurts.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	6	I agree. What do you think about allowing some of thse people in the US?	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	7	Well first of all I think we need to reform the official immigration process. It is a lot of red tape and waiting etc. That's why people just try to sneak in all the time. But as long as they are productive members of society I see no problem with immigration.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
121	8	It's pretty sad watching the news and seeing all these families being separated. :(	1	6.0	70.0	120.0
121	9	Yea it really is. Totally messed up. I can't imagine how traumatic that is for a child, let alone their parents.	2	6.0	63.0	620.0
123	0	Tell me how you feel about the situation?	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	1	I thought the article was very thought provoking and in line with things I felt already, that empathy is severely lacking in society in general. People are too dismissive of those suffering and assume they made choices to put themselves in that situation.	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	10	It is just really terrible?	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	11	I think a lot of it is just ignorance or how easy it is to ignore stuff rather than willful maliciousness but I'm not sure	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	12	What do you think is best corrective measure to stop this?	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	13	Probably like I said, school campaigns and media campaigns. I feel like something to do with social connections, charity, community building etc should be a class in school	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	14	I agree with that, do you think that is enough?	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	15	Probably not, but it's a start. I also do think politicians need to show more leadership in leading the charge even if their constituents don't all agree right away. Politicians are elected to be leaders not followers.	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	16	I also think there should be adequate punishment for whoever violates the rule	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	17	Not sure how people can be punished for lack of empathy, it would depend on the situation I suppose. But people should definitely call out others more for lack of caring.	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	18	Well, at the end i really hope we all do the right thing.....goodbye	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	19	I agree with that. Best wishes. goodbye	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	2	You nailed it honestly	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	3	"What did you think about the scenario at the beginning of the article about ""training"" people to have more empathy through scenarios, do you think that would work?"	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	4	I think that would go a long way as well	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	5	I do wonder how well it would work for the people who need it most, like how easy it would be for them to compartmentalize that it's not real or not. Or whether people like that would even try scenarios, outside of school or some place where they had to.	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	6	I think there should be more awareness to teach people how to show genuine empathy	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	7	Yeah for sure. I think schools would probably be the best place to start, or continue anyway, since kids are less set in their ways	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
123	8	Yes, also need to do this now so the generations to come do not face this sad situation.	1	6.0	61.0	122.0
123	9	Right. I think additional media campaigns as well that show the human face of conflicts, natural disasters etc, as well are important, so that people can't hide away from it as much	2	6.0	89.0	622.0
125	0	It is so sad...we really need more empathy for refugees.	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	1	I was wondering what exactly we could do for them?	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
125	10	The internal crises should be sorted first I guess	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	11	Agree. It was nice talking with you. goodbye	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
125	12	bye	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	2	I really dont know...Maybe donations	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	3	Essentially thats like a band aid isn't it? This problem has to be attacked at the source	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
125	4	Exactly..the social unrest here and there	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	5	I thought the mock home evacuation thing they did was pointless also. You can really pretend you are a refugee while you are in the safety of America	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
125	6	You have a good point with that.  People can easily pretend	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	7	Also Ive notice the places the article mentioned like Somalia and Afghanistan have been war torn for the last decade	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
125	8	that is correct..You cant take that away from those regions, lol. They love war	1	6.0	85.0	124.0
125	9	So if these regions will always be like this, and asylum seekers are growing each year, there definitely should be a different conversation besides just taking them ins	2	6.0	88.0	624.0
127	0	I think it is so sad that that man lost his wife and child due to a freak car wreck.. I really hope the guy wasn't street racing because that is just senseless.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	1	I agree, stories like this one makes me sad.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	10	That could be a factor in stopping accidents like this; but also I think drivers need to be 200x more responsible.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	11	I agree with you.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	12	I mean after all when you drive you are responsible not only for yourself but everyone else on the road.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	13	Do you think the driving age should change?	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	14	Hmm.. Not sure. Like I know plenty of responsible younger people who drive safe; and Plenty of older people who drive safe. Maybe there needs to be more education on just how much your driving impacts others? Although some poeple just don't care at the end of the day which is kinda messed up.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	15	I really can not stand people who drink and drive. They are so selfish.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	16	My dad used to do that with me in the car. Was scary as a kid.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	17	Sorry to hear that, glad you are okay.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	18	Yea he was kinda messed up; and thanks. But I agree people who drive like maniacs or abuse drugs while behind the wheel are really inconsiderate and not at all responsible.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	19	I lost one of my best friends in high school in a car accident. A man had a heart attack and hit her car killing her and two others.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	2	I really hope that the father gets the support he needs. It is unimaginable the amount of grief he must be going through.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	20	Oh wow thats crazy. I'm sorry for your loss :(	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	21	Thank you, it drove her parents and sister crazy. I still remember that day like it was yesterday .	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	22	I bet.. I've never had to deal with losing anyone from a car wreck. which is surprising seeing as half my family drive like maniacs.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	23	I drive so safe and always wear my seat belt since that day.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	24	Hell I don't even drive: I walk everywhere. Too anxious to get behind the wheel.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	25	I have to drive, but I'm a defensive driver.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	26	I mean I would drive but the thought of hurting someone else or doing something stupid etc just gets to me super bad.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	27	I think you would be a good driver.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	28	Thanks, well it has been a great conversation random turker. I hope you have a great rest of the workday :)	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	29	You too! bye	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	3	At least one of his children survived.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	30	goodbye	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	4	True, but to lose your wife and another kid in the same day still has to be rough. I hope they didn't suffer before the end but with the car on fire that might not exactly be the case..	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	5	I agree,  I would be broken if I lost my wife and child in one day.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	6	Yea legit I don't think I would be a functioning person after that.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	7	His cousin was mentioned, hopefully he has more family.	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
127	8	Yea he needs to surround himself with those he has left.	1	314.0	63.0	126.0
127	9	Do you think cars need to have there speed limited?	2	314.0	75.0	626.0
130	0	Hey, I can't even imagine what that father was feeling after hearing about that accident...	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	1	I felt the same way. I wonder if he will ever recover.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	10	I think I read that a relative survived the crash, I could've been mistaken. Anyway, I think it probably wasn't street racing. Police are used to estimating speeds due to skid marks and the damages to the vehicles. Although it's possible that the VW was flooring it and lost control before going that fast. And I've found that accidents are semi random and the damage to you has more to do with how you react (less damage if you didn't react). I hit a huge buck at 50 mph or so and completely totaled my car but didn't have a scratch on me. I've been in a minor accident as a passenger and I didn't feel good for a couple days.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	11	Youre right actually Two people out of the five in the van survived, which is everyone except his wife and two children. That's so horrible. I think head on collisions are worse also because the cars are moving in the opposite direction which increasing the impact.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	12	Do you think the survivors felt guilty at all? It's such a unique circumstance. And yeah, head on collisions are the worst.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	13	I think the Husband felt guilty, maybe that he wasn't there or wasn't the one driving. I don't think the survivors felt guilty, probably just lucky that they were in the right seat.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	14	I don't know...if I was in that circumstance, I would probably keep asking myself why this happened. Why didn't I ask if we could leave later or drive to a different location instead? There would be a million what if questions in my head. And why was I spared?	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	15	Would you feel guilty though? Would you ask why them and not you?	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	16	Yeah, basically. I haven't actually been in the situation so maybe there wouldn't be any guilt. From watching movies though, whenever this kind of thing happens, the main character always wishes that they somehow delayed the person who ended up killed. And if they had managed to do so, then the beloved person would still be alive.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	17	Yeah I could see that. I would just be depressed and feel so fragile because I just saw two people die and the only difference was probably a feet or two between us.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	18	They say football is a game of inches and life is an even better example. I hope that family was able to heal after this devastating accident. It was nice talking to you, have a good day.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	19	That is a good quote and it was nice talking to you. goodbye	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	2	If he ever does, it will take years. I can't even imagine hearing about such an accident. In mere moments, half your family is wiped away.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	20	bye	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	3	Do you think the other driver in the golf was street racing? It seemed like they were assuming he was	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	4	It's hard to tell, wouldn't the evidence be overwhelmingly obvious?	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	5	Yeah I guess I am always wondering about how situations like these can be avoided.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	6	I guess by not driving recklessly and paying attention while you're driving. If it had been street racing, I'm assuming the racing car would've been going really fast and that would've affected the accident.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	7	Yeah for everyone to die in both cars, the other car must have been going extremely fast. It just sucks that you can be like the Mother in this case, make no mistakes and still die.	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
130	8	Wasn't there one or two survivors in the van? And depending on how the van was (lacking safety features), you could probably die after an accident while going 60 mph.	1	314.0	81.0	129.0
130	9	I believe they all died. The mother the two younger children and the teenager. The other two definitely died in the VW. Sure I guess You could die in an accident going 60 mph. However I've been in one of those and walked away without a scratch. I dont think that could have been the case in this one	2	314.0	88.0	629.0
133	0	Man that whole Vial of Blood thing is kinda messed up.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0

133	10	Yea same. People are crazy though. Like if I see any of those red flags again you can bet im long gone.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	11	I cant dwell in such. I profile people up before even getting close	2	73.0	85.0	632.0

133	17	oooh..my bad. I avoid controlling people and manipulative people	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	18	Yea that is a good practice. I wish I was that sensible before I had a bad time haha.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	19	lol...You are now! and that is the brighter part	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	2	That Jolie wore when they were with billy bob. Thats kinda creepy, wearing eachother's blood in a necklace.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	20	True that, wouldn't be a better me if I didn't go through some bad times first. anyway it's beena  nice convo random turker :) have a great rest of the work day	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	21	yeah..bye	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	22	bye!	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	3	OOh..that. It is crazy	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	4	I wonder if she was really controlling and manipulative too in her relationships.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	5	I feel she is...most of these actor bring in their personality into their acts	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	6	I was with someone who was kinda like that before; really emotionally abusive. They did weird things too like keeping my hair etc.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	7	Damn!! that is creepy. I havent experienced that before	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
133	8	Yea it wasn't a great time :( I feel for all the guys jolie has dated because if shes anothing like my ex those guys deserve some space.	1	73.0	63.0	132.0
133	9	I hope they move on!	2	73.0	85.0	632.0
135	0	Hello. How are you doing? Interesting article right?	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	1	Hi!   I am doing well!  Thanks for asking.   It was an interesting article.   What are your thoughts?	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	10	There definitely a few who give more back and with the right intentions. Then there are those who just give back so they can look better. I could never imagine that life but honestly wouldn't want my whole life to be exploited either.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	11	Me either.  All the young people nowadays have every waking moment documented.  It will haunt them at some point	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	12	100%. I'm such a believer that what is put out on the internet can be seen by literally anyone and everyone. It's so not safe and is easily used against you. I get documenting it but not posting it online for 100+ people to have access to.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	13	And all the selfies.  How many photos do you want of yourself?  I don't get wanting to photos of yourself at all.   It's a disturbing behavior.	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	14	It makes me cringe. I just don't understand it and it's creating such self-centered humans.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	15	It just continues the downhill path of me, me, me.  It needs to get back to we, we, we.	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	16	Exactly but I unfortunately don't think that it will be reversed any time soon. It's only gotten worse so who knows where it will lead.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	17	It's all these electronic devices that we don't need.  It has made life more complicated that it needs it to be.   On a side note, when you take these hits, what are all the emotions based on - it never says.    Does it mean how I am feeling generally or how the story made me feel?	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	18	"I believe it's how the story made you feel. I think that's how I generally answer! Usually they are actually like sad stories or emotional stories but I think this is the first one I've read that wasn't ""sad"""	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	19	Me too.  It's a refreshing change.   I can't thank you enough for chatting today.  Blessings to you and yours.   goodbye	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	2	You know, I rarely follow celebrity news at all so I actually learned a thing or two today!	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	20	Thanks! goodbye	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	3	That's me :)   I just saw even with success and notoriety - there are those that can't find peace.  He felt he wasn't good enough.	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	4	Yes. And I mean I wouldn't blame the guy. Especially being 20 years older than her. Not exactly an easy age gap.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	5	"No it isn't.   Her world was crazy and she liked it - His world was quiet, reserved, and didn't like partying with the reach.    It ""appeared"" they had nothing in common at all"	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	6	Very much so. The divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous because of their lifestyle. I always like to hear about celebs who've been married for 15+ years. It's so rare.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	7	I know and it's folks you would not think about making it that long.   Jolie seems to go after men in movies they are together so she shouldn't be married in my opinion	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
135	8	Exactly. I guess it would be difficult to be an actress and not feel like your own life is a movie, you know? Almost like they aren't in touch with reality.	1	73.0	84.0	134.0
135	9	They aren't - a few are - Newman gives back - Bullock gives back etc.  Most just want to show off fancy houses, cars, etc.   1 in 5 kids are hungry - how much money does one need?	2	73.0	65.0	634.0
137	0	"I think it's always sad when parents get divorced.  Even if the daughters are ""adults,"" it still must be very sad that their parents are splitting."	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	1	I don't think you can say it's ALWAYS sad, as there's plenty of circumstances in which a divorce is healthy for all parties involved.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	10	"Yeah.  I also wonder how much being on the periphery of fame and fortune influences things.  You see a lifestyle that's more tempting but that you can't really participate in.  I wonder if that leads people to more strongly feel a desire for ""more"" and it's easier to be discontent with what you have."	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	11	I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	12	"Yeah, there's no question that opportunity is a huge part of that, and attraction in general.  We're sort of attracted to ""best available,"" whoever that is.  When your rich and famous daughters improve your ""best available"" I can see how it would be easy to stray."	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	13	It also brings excitement. When an attractive girl comes into your life, whether its because she works with you or she's a friend of a friend, everything gets more exciting. You care about whether you wore nice looking clothes and whether your haircut is on point. The chase is probably the most exciting part of life.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	14	Yeah, it pretty much all boils down to chasing trim.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	15	Our base needs are basically that and filling our stomachs lol.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	16	Yeah.  Just to be clear, I wasn't making fun of you.  I agree that these are biological drives we can't ignore.  I was just stating that in a glib way.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	17	Oh, I didn't even consider that you were possibly making fun of me. I'm easy going, even if you had been, I wouldn't care. When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind?	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	18	Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	19	If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a good day.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	2	I'd say that even in the situations where it's the healthiest for all parties, it's still sad that it came to that.  But I understand your point.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	20	Yeah, nice talking to you.  bye	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	21	bye	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	3	I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	4	I'm sorry to hear your parents divorced.  How did you view their divorce then and how do you view it now?  Do you think it was for the best?	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	5	I was crushed by it as a child. As an adult though, I think it was a good idea. I just didn't understand the differences they had as a child. I tried to ignore the numerous arguments everyday.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	6	I thought the article was pretty glib about it all, focusing more on the fact that the day is apparently hot.  Then again, it was TMZ.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	7	Yeah, stellar journalism lol. The article being brief was probably the point. This is a study afterall.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
137	8	Not that it matters, but I wonder about the circumstances regarding this type of divorce.  I can understand couples with kids and, you know, 8 years into marriage discovering that they can't keep doing it.  But 27 years, with adult kids.  That I don't readily comprehend.   I guess he got bored or something.	1	99.0	91.0	136.0
137	9	I honestly think humans aren't meant for these long term relationships. No matter how great your spouse/girlfriend is, you will tire of her eventually. And the reasons that they annoy you will keep multiplying until you ask yourself what the point of this relationship is.	2	99.0	81.0	636.0
143	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	1	I feel really bad for the innocent people stuck in the middle of that warzone. I don't understand why the middle east is such a hub for conflict. It is really needless.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	10	Yeah that's really tough. It's sad because i don't think ISIS is going anywhere anytime soon. I'm expecting more deaths to come which is crazy to think about.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	11	that palce is like..steeped in death. I think theyve been in conflict for a few hundred years at least. In general i mean; of course militant groups are different now.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	12	Let's hope none of that ever makes it way towards the US. That we're free from war.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	13	Agreed. Conflict like that here would be crazy. Especially because everyone and their mother owns a gun or two.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	14	It would definitely be an all out battlefield. Do you think there is anything that people can do to help the situation?	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	15	In the middle east? I don't think so. Theya re pretty set in their ways over there; I don't even think the war effort by us is even really making a difference.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	16	What do they do with babies there? Hope they're not killed as well.. actually i don't know if i even want to know.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	17	I..I don't know. I didn't even think of that. Man that could be really horrifying...	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	18	I think we will leave it at that. It was nice talking to you!	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	19	Likewise, great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday random turker. :)	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	2	It's insane. I thought we were close to getting rid of ISIS.. i guess not.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	20	bye!	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	21	goodbye!	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	3	Well I don't think you could really ever get rid of any militant group. There are always martyrs and inspire youth to take up their cause.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	4	That's true. To think of all the innocent children being killed is saddening.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	5	Yea kids get it the worst, they are either indoctrinated into the groups, orphaned by war, or killed/tortured by the bad guys. And if they live theya re traumatized for the rest of their lives.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	6	Yea, guaranteed they will be traumatized. I think i read they were putting people on poles? That's disgusting.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	7	They do all sorts of messed up things over there. My friend served a combat duty and told me he saw peoples heads on pikes and just bodies in the streets.	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
143	8	My god, that's horrifying. I feel bad for all the soldiers that had to serve there as well. It's equally as traumatizing for them.	1	94.0	70.0	142.0
143	9	For sure, my friend didnt speak for a week when he killed for the first time. He was in the bomb unit as well so you can imagine how stressful it is getting shot at let alone defusing IEDs	2	94.0	63.0	642.0
144	0	how do you feel about the sad situation?	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	1	It's absolutely terrible...I can hardly believe that it's real. These fanatical ISIS people are barely human...	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	10	Only if they can be helped	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	11	That's understandable, it's difficult to face murders who will kill you for any reason.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	12	I feel so sad for them	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	13	Yeah, thank god they've basically been beaten. ISIS has lost nearly all of the land that they controlled in prior years.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	14	I'm really happy about that at least	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	15	Yup, one of the best things that Trump did. He was really motivated to stamp them out ASAP.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	16	That was really positive	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	17	It really should've been done years ago. In the past, we would only arm the Iraqi and Afghanistani soldiers. And then ISIS would attack them, the defending soldiers would flee and ISIS would just take their gear and weapons.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	18	I hope they are really defeated completely soon..... goodbye	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	19	Yeah, though I believe they are nearly finished already. Evil like this will probably always exist though...It was nice talking to you. bye	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	2	I feel so sad reading that	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	3	It seems you could lose your life for basically any reason. Imagine getting killed because they discovered you had a cell phone!!	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	4	That was really sick	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	5	I can totally understand why millions of their citizens have fled to other countries for safety.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	6	I would do the same if i was in that country	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	7	Yup, I would do anything to get out. I would be insanely desperate.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
144	8	That act was inhumane	1	94.0	61.0	143.0
144	9	Yeah, it's a wonder that they can get away with doing it. The regular people have the numbers vs these ISIS fanatics but sadly they probably don't have any weaponry.	2	94.0	81.0	643.0
146	0	So I thought that was pretty tragic.  100,000 people is a huge number to be affected, killed even.  What do you think?	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	1	It's crazy. I can't imagine dying because of some toxic smoke. Not only can you be killed by suffocation, but if you survive down the line you could get cancer. Totally not cool	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	10	Yeah, I got the feeling this was an ongoing thing that kept happening each year, maybe not on such a large scale but still happening	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	11	Man that is messed up if so. Death is death.You would think some government agency or company would step in and try to prevent accidents like this from happening.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	12	Yeah you would think so.  I feel quite certain something like that that was killing 100,000 people at a time would not fly in the United States.	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	13	Well Cali has a ton of wildfires, but they actively fight those every year.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	14	Yeah definitely, I think we are pouring a lot of resources into preventing them.  Plus did they cause that many people to die?  I know there were some deaths but I didn't think it was on quite as grand of a scale.	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	15	I think maybe like 300-400 last year? but no not on the scale of these chemical fires.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	16	Yeah that is still a lot of lives to lose though.  I guess we are pouring resources into fighting them like you said but I'm not sure about prevention or if anything could be done to prevent those.  I thought they were somewhat of a natural occurrence.	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	17	Well yea lightning can strike and start a fire, so can some stupid camper who didnt put out their campfire; or a person throwing a cigarette out the window of their car. I don't think you can prevent them 100% but maybe if people do not do silly thing you could prevent like 50% of the fires.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	18	Yeah you are right my friend!  Careless mistakes like that can be highly costly even to the extent of people's lives.  Well it has been a pleasure discussing this with you, I hope you have an enjoyable afternoon.  goodbye	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	19	Yea very good convo. Have a great rest of the workday random turker! Goodbye!	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	2	Yeah, what the heck?? And infants are most vulnerable which is also truly terrible.	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	3	Was the smoke toxic from pollution or was it because of what was burning?	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	4	I think it was from what was burning but I'm not entirely clear.  Either way, it seemed like the people couldn't avoid it bc it was in the air so they were basially helpless	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	5	Yea and it''s not like you can hold your breath forever. 100k though, that is so many people. Way too much death for sure.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	6	yeah exactly, like there was nothing they could do.  And yeah that is a tremendous amount, like that could wipe out an entire city.  what on earth	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	7	That's legit a small town. Grief and suffering on an unimaginable scale. It is really sickening. I wonder if there will be better precautions in the future so this doesn't happen again.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
146	8	Yeah that's what I was thinking.  The article didn't touch much on specific actions that could be taken, more just generalizations.  Is anyone even doing anything to prevent this?	1	147.0	73.0	145.0
146	9	I'd hope so. A repeat of this would be even more tragic.	2	147.0	63.0	645.0
150	0	Hello, what did you think about the haze and fires?	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	1	Hey, that was probably the most surprising thing that I'd read today. I didn't realize that haze could kill 100,000 people!	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	10	Wow, they got lucky. It's scary to think that any day... your house could get burned. It's never guaranteed to be safe	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	11	Yup, life is like that though. Never know when you're going to experience a disaster. Btw, if you ever experience a fire endangering your home, turn on your sprinkler system. It has saved many million dollar homes.	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	12	Hmm, good tip. I'll keep that in mind! So you're from the east, you get hurricanes or tornados?	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	13	Neither, although my phone gets tornado warnings all the time lol. I've never experienced one before.	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	14	Lucky! Yeah natural disasters are no fun. I've been through a hurricane. We were supposed to evacuate but my family decided to stay. Nothing major happened but it was scary seeing trees and fences get ripped apart through your windows.	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	15	Did you have a basement to shelter in? I think that's what you're supposed to do. I'm in NY btw. Why did your family decide to stay?	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	16	Nope no basement. Only boarded up windows and doors.	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	17	Scary! I would've evacuated asap. I've seen too many rescue videos because people were too stubborn to leave. Good thing it ended up going ok though!	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	18	Yup. Interesting fact, houses in FL don't have basements because of the hurricanes and flooding. Also, it was nice talking to you! bye!	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	19	Yeah, I knew some sections of the country didn't have basements. They are nice though!! And nice talking to you too! bye	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	2	Wow, i must have read wrong because i 100,000 is a lot of people! I have family in Indonesia too	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	3	Did they ever complain about the after effects of the fires?	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	4	Nope, i never even heard about it so it must have been in another part. It's scary to think about though.	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	5	Definitely scary!! California is constantly on fire, do we have a harmful haze too?	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	6	I'm not sure but i have never heard of it. Oh yeah, there were those crazy fires just a couple months ago i think	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	7	It's more surprising to me when California isn't on fire...	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
150	8	That's true lol i've only been to Cali once. I heard it's terrible though. It's scarier than something like a hurricane because you can't really hide in your house.	1	147.0	70.0	149.0
150	9	I'm on the east coast but I have relatives in San Diego and they're constantly telling me horror stories about fires. A few times their house was a mile or so away from getting destroyed.	2	147.0	81.0	649.0
151	0	Man I feel so bad for that family. House fires are so random and it sucks that they happen. It is a shame that they lost their pets too :(	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	1	Yeah I felt the same way. I was actually surprised the cats didn't escape, aren't they usually good at getting out of disasters?	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	10	Yea.. that isn't a great way to die.. I hope the children of that family are handling it ok	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	11	Absolute worst way to die. My cousins have cats and there are so fearful of everything and always trying to escape, that why I was so confused that they didn't get out	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	12	I mean cats are usually pretty smart when they ahve to be as well so.. Maybe they were locked in a  room?	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	13	Yeah so that was what I was thinking. If they didnt get out it means that they absolutely couldn't. Which makes this even sadder	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	14	For sure.. I'm glad no humans were hurt, but the animal thing really pulls my heartstrings..	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	15	They didnt mention insurance either. I hope they had good insurance and fire insurance is probably needed here also right?	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	16	Yea thats usually covered in homeowners i think. Man if they didnt have insurance though...thats one bad hole to be stuck in. I really hope that they make it through this and get the support they need.	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	17	Yeah not to mention that area is right after San Francisco and New York for the most expensive homes in the country. Big ouch there	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	18	Oh yea.. Maybe some charitable organizations can help them out. That would be nice.	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	19	Yeah they should probably look into goFundme or something simiar. Anyway it was nice talking to you. goodbye	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	2	Usually yea. Maybe the smoke got them. Really sad. I hope the family is able to find a new home and move on..	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	20	likewise! have a great rest of the workday :) goodbye!	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	3	Yeah, NW D.C. is actually really lose to where I live, I wonder if its because a lot of these homes are really old and not up to code.	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	4	It is possible. I could se it being an electrical fire. Especially in an older home.	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	5	Yeah, thats probably the worst feeling too. Seeing your house burned and not knowing where you are going to sleep that night.	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	6	I can't imagine literally losing everything in an instant. Especially my pets... I cant fathom what that family is going though.	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	7	Yeah there is something really terrible about something as innocent as cats and dogs dying in a tragic fire.	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
151	8	Yea I'm really like sympathetic to animals. I used to work at a rescue shelter. That's wher eI got my current bundle of pent up energy haha.	1	125.0	63.0	150.0
151	9	Yeah I am not really a cat person but the idea of any animal being trapped in a burning house makes me pretty emotional.	2	125.0	88.0	650.0
159	0	what did you think about this artivel\	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	1	cancer is so scary and sad	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	10	Haha probably because the government doesn't want us talking about it	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	11	true healthcare is so corrupt!	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	12	For sure! It's insane, something that is soley for saving humans and helping them stay/get healthy has turned into corruption and greed	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	13	Yes, its just a money maker now it is so sad for the people in these situations that need help	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	14	My friend had jaw cancer, and couldn't afford the surgery he needed until it got so bad that they had to remove his salviarly glands and lower jaw... So he'll never really be able to eat normal food again	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	15	wow that is terrible insurance wouldnt cover that >	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	16	He didn't have any was his main problem and he couldn't get on medicaid	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	17	uh that is terrible im on medicaid its been great but soon im getting kicked off worried about that	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	18	why are you getting kicked off? I'm sorry...	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	19	Im getting full time at work so I will be making to much but our healthcare at work is so bad and expensive	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	2	It is... and it's awful that it's caused by humans	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	20	oh that sucks... I'm kind of in the same situation, so I just don't have health insurance. It's scary!	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	21	I totally agree! well its been nice chatting with you today!	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	22	you as well! bye	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	23	bye !	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	3	agreed more should be done to prevent it	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	4	For sure... but I don't think that will happen for a long time... and people will continue to get sick and suffer because of it	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	5	true maybe more awareness and programs being created	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	6	That would help	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	7	sad i bet these people dont really know the effects of pollution on there cancer	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
159	8	most peopel probably don't, it's not well known I don't think	1	302.0	68.0	158.0
159	9	true i wonder why	2	302.0	96.0	658.0
164	0	I think this is just terrible.	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	1	Yeah, I really wish the article had more details though.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	10	True gone are the days of getting the news through newspapers lol	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	11	Yeah, now it's all about reading breaking stories on twitter and other social media.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	12	yeah people dont even read the articles they just read the tweet headline and comment on it lol	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	13	Yeah ands sometimes the article titles are misleading, only to generate interest in an article on a different website.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	14	Back to the bears I feel we as people should find ways to stop this.	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	15	Do you think it meant visitors as in tourists? Or maybe people moving to areas that previously were wilderness?	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	16	i believe its tourists but hunters	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	17	Probably. I guess their furs would be valuable. I agree that something really needs to be done about this.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	18	I assume there is a monetary reason as to why they are doing this. Money is the root of all evil.	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	19	Yeah, everything corruptable about humans usually comes down to money. People need to value nature more than money, especially since we are losing different species of animals and plant life every couple years. It was nice talking to you.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	2	it seemed to be too short and doesnt say what the visitors do to the bears	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	20	Money comes and goes, creatures like polar bears do not. bye	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	21	Yup. bye	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	3	Yup, the way it was written, I assumed it was a poacher situation.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	4	yeah to me it seemed that way too	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	5	It also would've been nice to see how much the polar bear numbers are declining because of the visitors.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	6	just another reason why the article is just not a good one	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	7	Yup, it reminded me of a terrible newspaper article written to fill space.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
164	8	if journalism is that easy I think I might give it a go.	1	375.0	71.0	163.0
164	9	Lol, not so fast. It's pretty much a dead profession with all the papers going bankrupt. Although I guess you could write internet pieces.	2	375.0	81.0	663.0
173	0	How did you feel after reading the story?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	1	It was sad, especially since it might've been a protected species of rhino.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	10	I was thinking disease as well. Most infant animals die from disease if not predation. How old do you think the rhino was?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	11	I think it was really young, I don't quite remember specifics though. I think it had a 2 in there, so either 2 days/months/years old.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	12	What do you think a baby rhino smells like?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	13	Probably a bit more musty than what a human baby smells like. What do you think? Also rhino's are such cool creatures, I remember seeing them at the Philly zoo. Have you ever seen one in person?	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	14	No I have never seen one in person. It pains me to think of all the poaching they are at risk for	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	15	Yup, poaching semi-defenseless animals is such a disgusting thing. The only plus side is that I think rhinos grow their horn back if it's damaged or cut off by poachers.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	16	I did not know that. I think that is what they are mainly poached for. If they do grow it back, why not farm them instead?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	17	I think it's an ethical thing. Also most people have no use for rhino horns. It's only Asian medicine techniques that require them for good health or whatever.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	18	Yes Asia is the main market, which is why the horns are so valuable. I am sure scientist have established that there are no benefits from rhino horns but people still believe in fairy tales.... and rhinos still get poached	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	19	Yeah, it's a really unfortunate situation. Hopefully younger people in those areas grow up with more appreciation towards exotic animals and no longer purchase these kinds of things. It was nice talking to you.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	2	I was confused about that since an orphanage was mentioned. I was not sure whether it was a child or a rhino	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	20	I agree hopefully the internet can help educate and create awareness. I am still wondering how a rhino can become orphaned? What do you think?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	21	I guess the easiest way would be if poachers killed the mother/father rhino. Do you know if father rhinos care for the young rhinos too?	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	22	No I don't, but I don't expect that they do. In most mammals the females exclusively raise the young. I wonder how they orphans are discovered initially?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	23	I guess some people must've stumbled on the young rhino. Similar to when kittens and puppies are sent to shelters. Also the rhino might've not been orphaned, it could've just been born in the animal sanctuary.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	24	That makes sense. How long do you think a baby rhino can last in the wild without its mother?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	25	"They are herbivores, so they don't need to ""hunt"" for food like other meat eaters. So they would have sustenance, it's just a matter of surviving other predators until they are tough enough to protect themselves. I don't think many young animals survive without their mothers."	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	26	Yeah I was wondering how long they would be able to avoid predators. Without their mothers they are pretty much defenseless. I would really like to see one in person they seem like majestic creatures. Do they have good temperaments??	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	27	They are wild animals, so I imagine they would be unpredictable. If you don't intrude on their space, I don't think they would attack you needlessly.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	28	They seem aggressive to me, why else would they have that huge horn?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	29	I guess for defense mostly, since they don't even eat meat. Also maybe as a way of getting mates somehow? Anyway, it was nice talking to you. bye	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	3	I think it was some kind of animal sanctuary. Probably in a poor place too, as they didn't have power in their facility.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	30	goodbye	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	4	That does not sound like much of a sanctuary. Why would rhinos need power anyway?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	5	I guess for heating? The person in the article was trying to wrap the baby rhino with blankets to keep its body temperature high. Also power would help with treating these animals.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	6	What kind of treatment do you think they need?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	7	I'm not sure, as the article didn't go that in depth. The baby rhino probably could've been saved from whatever it was ailing from. Whatever it was, it killed the rhino after it fought for life for 48+ hours.	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
173	8	What do you think the cause of death was?	1	400.0	79.0	172.0
173	9	I haven't the slightest idea. Maybe some kind of rare disease?	2	400.0	81.0	672.0
175	0	I think it is so heartbreakin that that baby rhino died :(	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	1	yes i feel so sad about it	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	10	Well I know the local rangers and law enforcement at the animal reserves have beefed up their patrol efforts. I think they even patrol at night now. But other than like mroe patrols i dont think there is much they can do. Poachers build their own guns to hunt with, so it is hard to keep them unarmed.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	11	wow, i really can not think of any solution now	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	12	Thos epoaches guns are so sketch though, I remember reading something where one was killed because the gun exploded when he went to take down an elephant. He got trampled.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	13	wow, really	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	14	Yea they legit make them out of low grade pipes and any scrap they can find. A lot fo them arent even capable of firing modern cartridges and are used like flintlock rifles.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	15	how do you these animals can be helped at least?	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	16	Well, I'd say the game reserves/ orphanages need more funding. But toher than that I think they are doing all they can. I think it mostly comes down to controlling the poaching. Which is a hard task to do.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	17	I totally agree with you	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	18	Yea I just hate that those animals are getting killed just for one body part. It's a waste.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	19	it saddens me honestly	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	2	Like I used to work in animal rescue so like, any animal suffering or dying hits me hard.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	20	Same. Anyway great talking to you fellow turker. Have a great rest of the workday :) bye!	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	21	bye	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	3	why do you think that happened?	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	4	I'm not sure the article doesn't really say. I'd assume some complications when it was born or maybe it was sickly.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	5	I'm guessing so too	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	6	I wonder why it was an orphan though. Maybe it's aprents were poached for ivory?	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	7	i guess so too, that is sad	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
175	8	I think it's kinda messed up that they believe that ivory had medicinal properties over there. They kill so many animals just for their horns and stuff there.	1	400.0	63.0	174.0
175	9	what do you think can be done to prevent this	2	400.0	61.0	674.0
180	0	what did you think about this article	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	1	I think it's about time and I'm very glad the movement has so much traction!	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	10	Yes it's crazy how not long ago that kind of racism exsisted.	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	11	Yeah. We like to pretend all that's in the past, but it's way closer than we think.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	12	For sure... Like I saw on FB the other day that the first african american child that was allowed into an all white school just turned like 68 or something... how crazy is that	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	13	Whoa, that's nuts. Yikes for sure.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	14	But it's good knowing that things are changing	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	15	Yeah. I hope the situation in Saudi Arabia continues to change, hopefully without violence.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	16	Me too... Hopefully no war or civil war is started over any of it	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	17	Honestly, I feel like we (the US) are too invested in their oil production to let that level of disruption happen.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	18	you are probably right	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	19	Yeah. For good or ill. *shrug*	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	2	Me too! I hope it continues to grow	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	20	haha... It's good that this stuff is becoming more prevelant in the media.. keep the folks aware of real things	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	21	Agreed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article?	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	22	no I didn't.. it's been nice talking!. bye	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	23	bye!	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	3	Indeed. I know women just got the right to drive in Saudi Arabia a short while ago, so things are looking up at least.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	4	Oh really? i didn't even know they couldn't... how crazy is that that it just barely happened...	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	5	Yep. Only men could get licenses before that (one of the many ways to keep women from being independent).	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	6	That's so sad... But I am really glad they finally got the right!	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	7	Agreed! It's baffling to me that there's an opposition protest to the movement. Just... Yikes™.	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
180	8	"Yikes for sure... I hope that as the older generations ""age out"" we will see some of that opposition fade away"	1	283.0	68.0	179.0
180	9	Yeah, that's unfortunately how things often go. Like, even in the US, it took until 1990 for opinion polls to get over 50% of people approving of biracial marriages. Prejudice takes so long to die off :/	2	283.0	67.0	679.0
194	0	hello, what did you think of this?	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	1	I thought it was interesting... I never really hear about immigration outside the US border stuff	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	10	sorry, I hit enter too soon.  yes, so true!!  it just seems like such a sad situation without any real practical solution	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	11	It also sucks that there is such a negative connotation with it all because of the people who come over illegaly	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	12	yeah it's definitely a situation where the bad actions of some ruin it for many	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	13	"And the people in charge just want to waste money and time on building walls and ""blocking"" them from coming in instead of making it possible for them to come in and be productive members of society"	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	14	sometimes walls are necessary, as there are many who want to come in and not be productive members of society.  again, the bad who ruin it for the good	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	15	agreed, it could be helpful, but it seems there are other actions we could be taking	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	16	like what?	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	17	Like streamlining the process of imigration and making it more attainable. Streamline the process of becoming a citizen if you are already residing in the US. If their already living here, why not collect taxes from them?	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	18	yes, but the wall isn't made for people already living here.  anyway, I hear you and you seem to have a good heart.  I must go, have a good day! bye!	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	19	you as well bye	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	2	Yeah me neither, you're right.  I felt really bad for the men it described, I mean how scary, but on the same token Germany has a right to turn away whomever they want	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	3	It is scary for sure... but yes they have their rights, and I get it... I just wish there were better ways to deal with this kind of things ya knwow	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	4	yeah for sure, I do too.  Like a nation refugees could go to that was made just for them.	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	5	That would be interesting... or even just a more streamlined, human based process	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	6	yes,that considered each individual sitution.  I can't imagine how many applications they have to process, though, and someone has to pay for all this	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	7	For sure, it's got to be a crazy crazy workload....	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
194	8	yeah no doubt.  It	1	313.0	73.0	193.0
194	9	The other sad thing is, think how many other people have had similar or worse experiences then this guy	2	313.0	68.0	693.0
201	0	Hello. What did you think of the article?	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	1	I found it to be incredibly frustrating and sad, i think it is a shame that more is not being done to protect that forest and more importantly the Orangutan that call it home.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	10	I feel like sadly it is only going to get worse because right now a lot of the world is refusing to believe they are destroying the earth.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	11	I agree, i actually don't think it is possible for it to get better before it gets worse. People need to actually see the outcome of there actions before they can change.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	12	I know this is kind of morbid, but I feel like maybe all the scientists are right and we really only have a certain number of years left before we kill the earth. Feels like they are getting close to cutting all the trees down at least.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	13	They have to be getting close, and i believe it honestly. With how much pollution that has occured for the sake of greed i pray that we are able to change before the we finish the job on the earth.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	14	It would be nice to see some sort of group created that has the power to punish all countries that allow stuff like this to happen.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	15	I agree, almost like a united nations for environmental protection. Where the largest countries come together and ensure that change begins to occur. But that wont happen with so many people currently in power denying the issue.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	16	I know, here in America is feels like the government wants to destroy the environment. Maybe everyone in power is getting paid to keep quiet about he issues	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	17	They are definetely making a ton of money on keeping quiet and ignoring the issue. My big hope is maybe all this greed and innovation leads to the renewable energies like wind and solar starting to pay off big for us and maybe we start to phase out oil.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	18	I hope so, it makes so much more sense. I think sometimes nothing is going to change because so many people are afraid of new technology	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	19	I agree, but it is either accept new technology and change or watch as the world just gets worse and worse in the coming years	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	2	I agree. I can't believe that people get to make money off of destroying nature.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	20	Lets hope that doesnt happen! It was nice to meet you, have a great day. goodbye	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	21	Yeah lets hope, and nice to meet you also. goodbye.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	3	Exactly, and whats even more questionable is the lack of action from the Indonesian government. Almost like people have just decided it is okay if certain species go extinct.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	4	While I was reading the article I started thinking that the Indonesian government must be getting some sort of financial incentive to ignore the destruction.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	5	More likely than not. Even though it shouldn't be necessary maybe if only there were tax incentives or something for these companies if they are helpful with the environment.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	6	That's a great idea. I don't know what will make companies stop destroying the earth. Nothing seems to be working.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	7	Yeah i don't think they will stop until we are actually at the brink, or stopping makes them more money of course.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
201	8	Have you ever seen an orangutan in real life? It is unreal how human like they seem. I kept thinking about that while reading the article, they must be so scared.	1	31.0	90.0	200.0
201	9	Never had the chance myself but that is even more chilling, it is very easy to forget just how intelligent these animals really are. It doesn't make sense how people could look at the animals that are affected and not think maybe we shouldn't do this.	2	31.0	72.0	700.0
210	0	I think the whole trigger happy law enforcement situation in America is kinda messed up. What do you think?	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	1	I agree. I think it is completely out of hand. It is a hard situation to fix though, so many people think the police can do no wrong.	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	10	Yea lately there seems to be these emerging polar opposite sides in society. And both sides take things too far. Violence isn't the answer people. Ghandi and MLK did a ton without ever raising a hand against anyone. Things now adays are getting so far out of hand with all these shootings and riots.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	11	I always think about what would happen if everyone just went blind tomorrow. We wouldn't be able to see what anyone looked like. We would actually have to judge people on meaningful things other than their skin tone of their body shape. I mean obviously it would be terrible to not be able to see, but its interesting to think about.	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	12	If only we could actually act like that. Here in the south it is disgusting how people act towards eachother. I hear nbombs constantly. People always judge you by how you look. Especially the older people. They can be the worst. I remember being in a grocery store once and an older man wouldn't go through the checkout line unless it was a white girl ringing him up. caused a big scene voer something so stupid.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	13	Wow that is so obnoxious. It is amazing people like that have made it this long without getting into a ton of fights everywhere they go	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	14	I know right? God cops though of all people need to practice being non biased. They're supposed to protect people not shoot up people because of their skin color.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	15	What do you think would even help the situation at this point?	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	16	I'm not sure. It really just comes down to us human beings not being trash. Maybe some stricter laws or soemthing pertaining to when you can actually shoot someone as a cop. But yea i really don't know.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	17	I agree. People really are terrible. Hopefully as all the older people leave this planet the younger people can act differently, but it isn't looking too promising	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	18	Yea. I don't wish death on the older people but theya re so stuck in their ways that I don't think we can make positive change until 20ish years in the future..	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	19	Well I meant as they die naturally, I dopnt	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	2	For real. I live in the south and minorities are profiled constantly. An officer was just removed from the force in Chattanooga because he profiled a man just sitting on his porch and ende dup shooting the poor guy and his dog.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	20	Oh haha sorry I misunderstood. Anyway it's been a great convo random turker! Have a great rest of the day c: goodbye!	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	21	Sorry my last message got cut off because I pressed enter too soon ! Have a great day. goodbye	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	3	I can't even imagine what it must be like to be black and have to deal with the cops I would be so scared all the time. I never realized how lucky I was in all my dealings with the police in my life.	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	4	Yea around here if you are white the cops don't care unless you are dealing drugs. It is pretty sad that I can wlak alone at 3am and they dont care but as soon as they see a black guy hes getting searched.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	5	There was a big case here in New York, some poor guy was selling bootleg cigarettes on the corner in New York City and the cops arrested him. The guy was kind of big I guess and they were scared of him so they wound up choking him to death. For selling illegal cigarettes. The cops got to keep their jobs too I think. White people here mostly think the cops are perfect so nothing will ever change	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	6	Around here everyone doesn't like cops. They are shady. There have meen many cases of them being removed from the force; plus cases of people impersonating them to do messed up stuff. Oh and the excessive force.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	7	It's good that they are at least being held accountable. Know what really blows my mind, is that until a few years ago when the Trayvon Martin case happened, no one even knew these things were happening. I never would have believed that cops were murdering black people for no reason. It's so crazy that  everyone ignored what was happening	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
210	8	Yea people tend to ignore things when it isn't happening to them personally or when it is swept under the rug. I just wish we as a whole weren't so prejudice towards eachother. It's dumb we're all people who cares about what ethnicity we are.	1	201.0	63.0	209.0
210	9	I agree. It just seems to be getting worse. There are so many people who I would have sworn were not racist, and now they very clearly are. I guess they were all in hiding waiting until they felt safe enough acting racist. It's terrible. I don't know how it can't be fixed	2	201.0	90.0	709.0
215	0	what did you think about thi	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	1	I just feel for them it is so sad what about you>	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	10	For sure, there was no reason for it to happen other than brute force	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	11	Altho the lady shooting at the police was not good on there end	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	12	Totally agree, they did not have to do that either	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	13	That is why I can see both sides police doing there jobs the people protecting whats theres	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	14	Yah... that's a good point. The whole situation should have just never happened... it's sad that kids are growing up like this	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	15	I agree and that we cant come to a peaceful solution first	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	16	yes its sad	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	17	I think they ended up putting the pipeline in to	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	18	Really? I hear about this story but I have not followed it very well	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	19	Oh yeah I believe so that is what i heard and many people were so sad	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	2	It's super sad... and crazy that this is a current thing. It sounds like it should be from the 1800s or somethign	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	20	That sukcs...	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	21	it was great chatting with you!	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	22	you as well! bye	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	23	bye	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	3	I agree I wonder why the government did not honor the treaty	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	4	Probably because they would loose money over it	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	5	True, I feel like these people felt so up against the wall nothing they could do	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	6	Yes they had limited options for sure	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	7	I felt so sad that the child lost his horse right in front of him	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
215	8	I know that was the part that got me! Not only the horse's life, but that child will be scarred! It's a barbaric action almost	1	273.0	68.0	214.0
215	9	Yes! I feel like something less violent could have been done to deter them	2	273.0	96.0	714.0
219	0	hello , do you remember the terror attacks from the article?	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	1	I have memory of it.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	10	not directly, but overall they were related in terms of being carried out by radicals against the west	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	11	I see.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	12	i wish things like that would just not happen	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	13	It's interesting to see the different types of terror attacks the occur between both the US and Europe. The US having the one man terror attacks and abroad having a more group coordinated type.  Horrible overall.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	14	yeah i agree, i would like it all to stop	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	15	That starts in legislation and regulation.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	16	i hope we are able to achieve peace	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	17	yes	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	18	it was nice talking to you! goodbye	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	19	bye	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	2	it was awful, it still is shocking	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	3	Yes, very shocking.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	4	there seemed to have been a lot of attacks around that time	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	5	Absolutely crazy how many people died due the coordinated events. I remember i was at the library at the time and reading upon the events. I cannot imagine the pain the families were and are in then and now.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	6	i cant imagine being the band playing on stage at the time iether	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	7	Terrifying. I wonder what has been done since then to protect the public from such attacks.	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
219	8	i am not sure, the aria grande attacks were arounf that same time i believe	1	247.0	64.0	218.0
219	9	Yes, i remember that as well. Were those events related?	2	247.0	62.0	718.0
220	0	hey there i am shike	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	1	Hello@ I am Jen how are you	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	10	very true... its a terrible thing to happen to someone. i just hope the security system gets better	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	11	Me too. I don't know how they can prevent these things from happening	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	12	same here.. well that's left to the security agencies to figure out	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	13	Can you imagine being one of the people who were hiding in the venue. It said they hid for over an hour while hearing gunshots. That must have been so scary	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	14	i really can't imagine such. the screams of pain and agony for over an hour .that's like a life time trauma	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	15	I wonder what kind of person can hurt people like that. I can't imagine killing another person.	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	16	yeah. i pray for the end of the ISIS terrorist group and other groups .. horrible things are carried out by them	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	17	It is so true. I am worried for everyone in the world. If humans are able to kill each other so easily things are only going to get worse.	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	18	you are right. its nice talking to you about the topic. goodbye	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	19	Have a great day! goodbye	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	2	i am fine and you ?	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	3	I am good. What did you think of the article?	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	4	its an unfortunate event and believe improvement in security against terrorism should be in place	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	5	It is terrible. I have gone to many concerts in my life and I never had to worry about being shot. It is scary that we all have to worry about that now.	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	6	yeah such an event isn't what one should experience	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	7	It seems like any public event isn't safe anymore. A few weeks ago there was a shooting at a garlic festival in California. There were families there. It is so sad	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
220	8	I just hope enough support is given to the victims of such events	1	247.0	82.0	219.0
220	9	The beginning of the article talked about a victims dad finding out his daughter was dead. It said he found out over social media. I can't imagine how scary it must be not to know if your child is alive.	2	247.0	90.0	719.0
230	0	what did you think about this article	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	1	I feel so bad for these little guys	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	10	yes, or even at places that sell ponds, make it madatory that they come with some sort of info panfelt	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	11	Oh that is a great idea some kind of warning	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	12	yah that way it will reach everyone who is getting one or updating theirs	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	13	Very true some sort of law two	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	14	that would help also	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	15	poor little guys seems very painful	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	16	Yes they've got to be suffering	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	17	wish there was a cure for them	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	18	I wonder if anyone is working on finding one	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	19	Maybe the zooligist as frogs are important to the ecosystem	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	2	me too! Poor things	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	20	that's true, we need them around	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	21	its been great chatting with you!	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	22	you too! bye	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	23	bye	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	3	sad that humans have a hand in it	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	4	Yes... we always seem to	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	5	i think its mostly ignorance	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	6	Probably... we aren't very aware of our enviroment	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	7	yeah more needs to be done	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
230	8	It sounds like the governemtn is trying to make people aware, but also that they could be doing more	1	139.0	68.0	229.0
230	9	I agree more like on the news or in newspapers radio	2	139.0	96.0	729.0
234	0	What did you think about this?	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	1	I think that it's sad she was questioned and doubted what seems like right off the bat	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	10	yep and she had to sit on it for so long	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	11	i wonder why she did that	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	12	I wondered the same.  maybe she was scared bc he was powerful?  or didn't want to mess up her career? what do you think	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	13	Those are both valid points, could have been both. I'd probably feel/act the same way I think	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	14	yeah it would definitely be an uncomfortable position to be in for sure, it's good she finally came forward	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	15	Agreed, that guy needed to be stopped from being able to do this again. Very strong of her to do!	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	16	yes! he was clearly abusing his power in a grotesque way	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	17	for sure... People can be awful.	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	18	they really can.  it is so disgusting and sad.  well i hope you have a good day, I gotta go.  bye!	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	19	you too! bye	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	2	You think they should have just automatically believed her?	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	3	pretty much yah... innocent until proven guilty, just flipped right	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	4	I disagree, what if they assumed all allegations against men were true?	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	5	You have to assume that first yes. and then investigate and go from there. If you doubt initiallly what does that do to the victim if it is legit	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	6	I think you have to be neutral until you gather facts.  if you assume guilt, what does that do to the accused if later it is found they were innocent??	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	7	same visa versa though, what does it do to the victim? I think what you're saying about remaining neutral is smart... But you have to think like, you call the cops and tell them your house got robbed, and they start off with doubt. Their not gonna pour all the effort they could into solving this for you.The doubt needs to be based on facts just like the belief	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
234	8	that analogy is not the same bc it is not potentially ruining someone's life and reputation, but anyhow I don't want to have a debate bc we clearly disagree and I am not going to change my mind.  as far as the article, it did seem he is probably guilty in this case.  I feel bad for the woman	1	128.0	73.0	233.0
234	9	agreed, I think he's guilty too. I feel bad for her... lifelong thing to deal with	2	128.0	68.0	733.0
250	0	What did you think of this?	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	1	Well it's an interesting article. I think with all political bias' aside, Parkinson's disease is not a fun illness to live with. What do you think about it?	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	10	hahaha I was too.  No, hardcore Clinton hater here.  sorry not sorry	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	11	I can 100% agree. I just don't understand the people who can read the news or media and not see the corruption. I rarely read it and can see it!	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	12	Me too!!!  Are they so blind?  It seriously shocks me.  It is infuriating.	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	13	It's heartbreaking honestly. I have sympathy for those people for sure!	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	14	Yeah I guess I should.  I feel like the news is partly to blame bc it is so biased but people should know better	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	15	It's true. I do feel like media has such a strong impact on the next generation. People are so brainwashed.	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	16	Yes they really are, and people seem to believe whatever they read.  It is sad really	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	17	It's crazy really. I do so much research just on selecting a new brand of bread!	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	18	hahaha you are funny.  I am the same way!!  well thanks for the talk, it has truly been a pleasure.  have a good day, bye!	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	19	goodbye	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	2	Yes, I totally agree.  I did not like her or  her politics, but I have sympathy for anyone who went through that disease as well as their family	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	3	Yes. It's slightly hard to have sympathy for her specially unfortunately. Not a huge fan of the Clinton's either so their opinion of her isn't helping her case.	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	4	yeah haha you and me both.  But I am trying to muster some sympathy.  maybe for the family.	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	5	Yes exactly. I'm not much in to politics but this made me chuckle because it seemed very bias. I'm sure this lady wasn't perfect.	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	6	Yeah it was biased.  I try to keep up with politics but I'm not fanatical.  Either way, I know enough to know she does not endorse the same things I do.  So maybe I am biased too.	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	7	I can agree completely. It's the first article I've read on here that I didn't feel any sympathy to be honest	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
250	8	haha omg I think me too!!  well I may have seen a few others but this is one of the top for sure.	1	177.0	73.0	249.0
250	9	And I was slightly worried I would be matched with a hardcore Clinton lover and it was going to get interesting!	2	177.0	84.0	749.0
270	0	Hello what did you think about the article	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	1	It wasn't a very pleasant read. I can definitely empathize with those people.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	10	True, we have our own issues but at least our lives aren't at stake. Well except for shootings	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	11	Well yes but even shootings occur in other countries on our level and we just hardly hear about them. It's crazy how much stuff we don't realize.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	12	Yeah everyone's too busy with their lives to really dig into all of this!	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	13	Yes exactly. They'd rather just put blame on other people and get on with their lives.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	14	I guess i can be guilty of this at times but there is nothing you can really do. Just emphatize and move on	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	15	Exactly. It's sad that we can't do much but everyone has their own worries to worry about. Not saying their own worries are more important, but sometimes they are.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	16	Yup i agree. Do you think the future will be better for those people in that country?	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	17	One can only hope but at the same time, probably not.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	18	Yeah, let's pray for them! It was nice talking to you! bye	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	19	Exactly. goodbye.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	2	It's terrible what they have to go through on a daily basis	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	3	Yeah, I can't even imagine if that happened in America	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	4	Me neither. Imagine always having to run away from something.. even when you did nothing wrong	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	5	Exactly. It's not a good situation. But it could happen anywhere in all reality	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	6	Yeah that's true just not to that extent. wish there was something we could do to help	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	7	Yeah, not much that can be done. Especially in these small countries that we don't hear about for months after the fact.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
270	8	I feel very fortunate after reading that article	1	47.0	70.0	269.0
270	9	Yes, anyone in America should. Things like this seem to happen everywhere but there are still crap things that happen here too but just not to the extreme.	2	47.0	84.0	769.0
278	0	Hey how are you doing? What did you think about the article?	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	1	"I""m good and you? The article is sad."	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	10	Yeah, it seems like they don't allocate the money properly. I feel like here in the US they have more and more programs for kids in schools to get food even when they aren't at school.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	11	I agree. No child should go hungry. Like you said there are a lot of countries out there with a lot of hungry children. It is sad to think about.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	12	It really is. I feel like we don't even realize how many countries actually struggle. But at the end of the day, how can we know for sure that the money or organizations we donate to are using the money properly? It's hard.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	13	Yeah, I heard some bad things about some of the charities doing relief aid.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	14	Yes, so have I. It's crazy what people do with money that should be going to something to help children.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	15	Greed is a horrible thing. I couldn't sleep at night if I did that to children.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	16	Most definitely. It breaks your hear that some people will do anything for money. I am so minimalist that I would rather live with what's on my back than have anything extra.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	17	I sometimes wonder how far have we gotten away from loving life without having to have a lot of unnecessary things.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	18	Yes. It's a materialistic world these days. I wonder how different it may be in these other countries. I would love to travel and see it first hand because you'd really be able to emphasize with them more.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	19	I agree. Technology is a good and bad thing. I think we are more detached now days.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	2	I'm good. Yeah the article is sad. You don't really realize that a lot of countries still really struggle with hungry children.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	20	Very much so. It really is a blessing and a curse. I really think that some aspects have improved from technology but our interactions with others have decreased.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	21	Would you donate more if you knew 100 percent went to the people that needed it. I would.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	22	Yes oh yeah. I don't trust organizations enough currently.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	23	Plus a lot of them have a lot of overhead.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	24	Exactly. They have to get paid too so where does that money come from?	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	25	I also thing is it better to set up systems to improve peoples life not  only just give them food or money.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	26	Yes yes yes. Because even if you were to give them money or food, the issue will repeat again and again. Especially if there is corruption with the government in those places.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	27	I would like to travel to different countries like you said. See things first hand.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	28	Yes. I think also going to those places and helping first hand is more helpful too.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	29	Do you have any other thoughts about the article?	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	3	Yeah, It makes me think about how much food my family waste.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	30	Not specifically. It was a pleasure speaking with you	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	31	You TOO! goodbye	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	32	goodbye	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	4	"Yes! Oh man, exactly. I feel like in America it's so easy just to throw away something because it's ""expired"" but really any one in any other country would still use those products."	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	5	My children are so picky of what they will eat or won't eat, but it is hard for them to understand how other children in the world are feeling.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	6	Yeah, that is a really tough concept to teach to kids. I'm lucky that mine are young enough to not know any different	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	7	Do you feel like it is their government's fault?	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
278	8	I think government definitely has some influence on it but I'm not one to put the blame on something even when it's needed. Although it sounds like the government over there isn't ran very well.	1	370.0	84.0	277.0
278	9	Yeah, I thought they had a lot of oil money in the country.	2	370.0	75.0	777.0
295	0	What did you think of this article?	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	1	I think it's sad...	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	10	Yeah and honestly I don't even understand it.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	11	Me neither... like why is it even going on? what are we fighting over	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	12	Yeah exactly!  I mean, I get that it has to do with oil, and terrorists, but it seems like there's more to it.  Regardless, what terrible luck to be born there.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	13	There has to be more to it! And why are we putting oil above human lives... it's awful	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	14	Right?  I can't imagine worrying about being blown up each day	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	15	It would be so awfull... and having children there. I can't imagine the stress	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	16	OMG right?!  It's unimaginable.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	17	I wouldn't even want to have kids	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	18	Yeah I was thinking the same, and my kids are everything to me.  So that's saying a lot.  But it would be too scary, just the thought of something happening to them every day.  Ugh.  Unbearable.  Well it has been great talking to you, I hope you have a great day!  bye	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	19	you as well bye	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	2	Well yeah, 30 civilians died.  I think it was very sad.  These people are caught up in this ridiculous conflict.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	3	Yes, and it seems like for no reason	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	4	Hey, with all due respect, would you mind responding a little bit faster?  The HIT will expire if there is so long between responses and it makes it hard to have a conversation.  :)  Anyway, yes it seems like such senseless killing.  I can't imagine how the people living there must feel.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	5	Yes sorry my internet is being weird. I wouldhate living there... and hate having to go to war over there	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	6	Internet issues are a drag.  Yes me too, it makes me very grateful to be an American when I read things like this.	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	7	For sure... it's crazy that things like this are still going on in today's day and age	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
295	8	YEah seriously, you would think we would be past this.  Plus, that war has been going on since the beginning of time it seems	1	242.0	73.0	294.0
295	9	Agreed! It seems never ending... and there is no end in sight	2	242.0	68.0	794.0
298	0	what did you think about this article	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	1	Well, I think we need more information.  I read a different article about the Calais camp and it gave a different story.  The refugees were apparently causing problems there, and it got out of hand.  I don't really know what to think.  I feel sad for children who suffered.  What did you think?	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	10	Interesting... Either way... the kids is what get me. They did nothing and do not deserve what is happening to them/going on around them	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	11	Yes I think it is sad for the kids, too.  innocents.  they kinda made it out like it was just a bunch of kids, though.  accoring to another article it was 62% med aged 33 on average	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	12	Interesting... I think their banking on the kids aspect is what's grabbing peoples attention and putting the sympathy vote on them	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	13	"I meant to say ""men"", but yeah I agree.  It seems like they only covered part of the story.  But all bias aside, I do think it is sad for the children who were there.  I wonder how old they were?  like teens or little kids?"	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	14	Probably a mix of both... Can you imagine growing up in that kind of tramau?	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	15	It would be terrible, and the other article said a lot of the children were unaccompanied, so where were the parents??	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	16	Oh no I hope they aren't dead...	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	17	yeah that would be very sad, I guess it is possible	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	18	That or they are not there for their children, which is sad as well	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	19	Yeah good point, that is equally tragic.  Well I must go, thanks for the talk!  bye	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	2	That is interesting that there might be another side to this article, it didn't really elude to that	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	20	BYE	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	21	it has to be lowercase unfortunately	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	22	sorry caps was on. bye	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	23	bye!	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	3	Yeah no it did not.  It seemed a bit biased to me.  But regardless, it certainly sounds like the situation got out of hand.  The camp couldn't be supported and there wren't enough resources there.  I know it became a big problem for the French government.  They had to clear it all out.	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	4	It does seem a bit biased, like they are trying to pull at our sympathy. How did the French government handle it?	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	5	Yes, that was my take on it too.  They cleared the camp out!  It was causing too many problems. IT took several attempts and the refugees protested, burned things, threw rocks, etc., the typical rioting behavior.  But eventually they were put out and I think most went to other countries or areas and carried on.	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	6	That's crazy... so it seems like both parties could be at fault	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	7	yes that was my thoughts	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
298	8	It's weird that this had a biased article. All the ones I've done have seemed not so	1	339.0	68.0	297.0
298	9	"I think I may have encountered a few that seemed biased.  I actually read another article on here about Calais camp and it was a little less biased.  It certainly didn't use the word ""abusive""."	2	339.0	73.0	797.0
302	0	Hello	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	1	Hi. How are you?	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	10	i see	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	11	So, I think the lesson here is that there really needs to be some counseling available for recovering governments - as crazy as that sounds - a not-for-profit that can help a sincere government regain control after something like the Boko Haram issue	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	12	I like that solution	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	13	Of course, it requires a lot sincerity on the part of the government. I think it is has a potential to be more effective than the mandated democracy via military action that the US tried in Iraq.	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	14	TRUE	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	15	What gets me, though, as a parent, is the idea that the kids have to suffer for the follies of the adults. What do you think about all the suffering that comes from these horrible situations? How could that be managed?	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	16	I think leaders in the region needs to step up and do something or remove them	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	17	If they are removed, how should it be done, and who should be put in their place?	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	18	Put some people that serve their immediate interest. Someone with vision and enough power to get things done	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	19	Rome had a triumvirate. Three people in charge. Should a constitution allow a group of three to be installed when a single leadeer has failed?	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	2	What did you think of the article	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	20	I think they should i think it makes better sense to me	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	21	That's nice. My timer is almost how. I think you need to say bye first if you are done with the conversation	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	22	ok goodbye	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	23	bye	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	3	It makes me quite sad. I feel for these people without food available.	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	4	Tell me about it	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	5	ABout the article or my sadness?	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	6	Both. I think there needs to be more support	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	7	It seems to me from the article that the problem is less about getting the support in the area, and more about building a structure for self support. For instance, the farmers are unable to return to usable land because they are not secure there.	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
302	8	I think some support is need to secure the land to make it usable, dont you think?	1	347.0	86.0	301.0
302	9	Well, the article legitimately points out that this support has to be mandated by government first. Getting food to the people is one action that is beneficial, but it isn't curbing the real problems.	2	347.0	76.0	801.0
303	0	Well, what did you think?	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	1	It's always so sad to read about these countries struggling with hunger. It constantly makes you feel like we don't do enough	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	10	I hope that these people do actually get help and are not left dying	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	11	I do too. It's hard to know if it's improved in the last decade or if it is really getting worse.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	12	Yeah and all we can do is hear what is going on in the news but not actually know what is going on.	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	13	Most definitely. You can't always believe what they are saying in the news. You almost want to hope they are lying in these situations.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	14	I wonder if any children from that area actually make it out and get a decent living	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	15	That would be something. You would really have a story and strength if you are able to.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	16	I agree. Let's hope it does happen though	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	17	Yes. I can't imagine the people who would want these people to go hungry.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	18	Yup! It was nice talking to you. bye	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	19	goodbye	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	2	It's terrible because we even waste food on the daily	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	3	Exactly. Not one family in even North America can say that they don't waste any food.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	4	I am guilty of that. I always end up throwing away leftovers	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	5	Oh yes. Even America's standards of expiration dates is a lie and we know it yet we still throw things away. We live in such a different way than them.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	6	I a gree. Have you ever donated to charities with these causes	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	7	I honestly have not and that's only because I'm skeptical on whether it's really helping or not yanno	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
303	8	I agree. They could be going to the wrong places. Then sadly, there really is no other way to help	1	347.0	70.0	302.0
303	9	Yes. The charities are usually ran by companies and they have to pay their employees and so it just makes you wonder where that money is coming from. And even traveling to these countries is so hard to do but that's the only way I see us helping.	2	347.0	84.0	802.0
309	0	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	1	I thought it was tragic	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	10	yeah neither can I, it must be terrible	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	11	I understand fleeing to another country with your family, but I can't imagine having to leave behind a parent/grandparent like that	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	12	That would be terrible I dont know if i could do it	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	13	Not just the elderly either, people with disabilities would probably be left behind as well	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	14	yeah i cant even imagine@	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	15	Do you know if that war is still going on? I haven't kept up with current events as much as I should.	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	16	Theres always something going on over there unfortunately	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	17	it does seem that way. I wonder if the elderly would want to leave too if given the option, or if they felt like they should stay because its what they have known	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	18	yeah i could see that happening as well	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	19	Well I hope that my family never has to see anything like that or make those decisions - off topic but do you want to try to go for 15 or 20 turns for the bonus?	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	2	I agree, very sad	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	20	sure, but i do need to leave here soon!	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	21	actually I need to go, thanks for the conversation, bye	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	22	goodbye!	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	23	goodbye	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	3	I cant imagine working your whole life for you kids and grandchildren just to watch it go up in flames like that	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	4	I know, it would be so awful	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	5	What hit you the most from the article	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	6	The part about them rationing food	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	7	yeah it would be miserable to have to ration food like that	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
309	8	and just living that way while being so elderly	1	48.0	64.0	308.0
309	9	I worked in an old folks home for a while and its sad even there, I cant imagine many of those people trying to make it on their own again in those circumstances	2	48.0	94.0	808.0
310	0	What did you think of this article?	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	1	It's always so hard to imagine these countries and the struggle they are experiencing. I wouldn't want to be in their situation and count my blessings. What about you?>	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	10	Another dark part of refugees relocating is there is no one keeping these families together.   Some are here in US, the same family has members in Canada or Brazil.   It's bazaar.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	11	Oh wow. That is bazaar. That just makes matters so much harder. The system is unfortunately not the best.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	12	To me everything is simple.   Example:   US can take 2000 refugees this year.   Why not take a whole family at a time to get to the 2000 ?   It's not rocket science.   My imagination is are they saying you, you, you get to go???	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	13	Yeah, just completely random selections to make it seem unbiased maybe? I don't know enough about it apparently because I had no idea it was like that.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	14	Well I didn't either until I started volunteering.   Most come here with absolutely nothing especially shoes.  They walked barefoot for smiles and smiles.   When they finally get here, they have flip flops that were given to them.   I live in Colorado so we have 9 months of snow each year.   I head up a Christmas Shoe sponsorship where families adopt a child and the main purpose is to give them a sturdy pair of athletic shoes.    If they want to give something else, perfectly fine.   We give photos to the families and their children get involved after they see their sweet faces.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	15	Oh wow. That's so tough but so awesome about the sponsorship. It makes it a tad better.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	16	Yes so far I have 560 sponsors.   I still need 20 more for kids and 100 for the adults.  I'll get it.      If you haven't worked as a volunteer to help these folks, I highly recommend.   The parents cannot speak English so the children never have anyone to help them at home.   Tutoring brings them joy as well as you feel like you helped them.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	17	That's so great that you can help them. It's great to hear that people are actually putting valiant efforts into changing something about the struggles. You don't hear it often. I'll definitely look up the organization. What city is it based out of?	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	18	It's most everywhere that has a city.  Mine is in Denver - but the refugees are located in most all cities in the US.    It was so nice chatting with you about this topic.   Blessings to you and your family,  goodbye	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	19	Thanks again. goodbye.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	2	Same here.   All I can picture was the 70 year old man saddened and weak.   Everything he worked so hard for was gone and he had to stay.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	3	Exactly. I can't even imagine. Especially that old to have lost it all.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	4	I know.   I volunteer at an at-risk youth center in the city.   The majority of the kids I work with are refugee families.   We have no idea how blessed we are.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	5	Yes that's very true. It's hard for me to imagine. Youth these days have it so much more difficult than us.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	6	These youth are from Syria, Jordan, Sudan, Ethiopia.   They all came from the countries this story is conveying.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	7	Oh wow. That hits home for you then. I just can't even imagine how they feel. I'm sure you deal with the anger and sadness from them	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
310	8	Not so much anger but more TBI symptoms.   I had to take a lot of classes to understand it in order to be able to work with them.   No one know except them the impact of years of bombing and homes being burned how that permanently affects children.	1	48.0	65.0	309.0
310	9	That's true. I can't imagine wanting to really want to talk about it, especially here in the US. I feel like it's such mixed emotions and opinions.	2	48.0	84.0	809.0
312	0	I found the article to be very sad, and anger-inducing. How about you?	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	1	Yes, dogs shouldn't be left in cars like that, there should be more responsibility taken here.	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	10	You would think that there shouldn't be much evidence to provide. I don't think it would go that far, unfortunately, but I feel like it should. If it were a legit  human, I wonder what would happen from there.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	11	hm, I'm not sure. In any case there should also be procedures for making sure that doesn't happen in the first place	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	12	There should be. I just hate hearing stories about deaths caused by cars due to negligence. I would love to see that cop do ten years for the death of that police dog. Sorry, this story gets me steamed.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	13	that's a lot of years, but perhaps he deserves it.	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	14	I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	15	I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	16	Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	17	no, I think you're being very reasonable. Yeah maybe they would be more careful. They definitely should be.	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	18	I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end. But yeah, hopefully we can deter behavior like that in the end.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	19	ideally it would be possible. The goal should be preventing things like this from happening to begin with however that can be done most effectively	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	2	Honestly, I feel like the officer should be charged with involuntary manslaughter. They consider police dogs to be police officers. I feel it's important to set a precedent here.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	20	Right. I think if you set down strict rules about procedures with partners/K9 units, then, hopefully, people will pay more attention. Maybe up the punishment for this situation, and they'll definitely be more careful.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	21	That makes sense. Maybe there could be specific training too? I'm not sure what the best procedure is for making sure dogs are safe in cars in all situations	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	22	Yeah, hopefully all of that is already in place. If not, then it should be. Well, I can't think of anything else. My rant steamed out ha ha	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	23	makes sense. Alright, nice talking to you, goodbye	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	24	goodbye	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	3	That kind of makes sense, I was not sure whether to believe they suffered consequences at all honestly	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	4	They were definitely vague. I think they were on suspended leave, un-paid. But you know, that's pretty messed up if they're not being charged with anything. I feel like negligence like that needs to be severely cracked down on.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	5	yeah, I wonder how realistic that even is though, the consequences always seem vague and small	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	6	It's unfortunate, but you're right. That's why I feel like they should be charged with the murder of a police officer. If a criminal were to shoot a police dog, they would be charged with murdering an officer. But a cop gets away with leaving the dog in the cop car? I mean, ugh. That's really aggravating.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	7	would they really be charged with that? That definitely seems hypocritical	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
312	8	I hope they're charged with involuntary manslaughter of a police officer. I swear, if you set a harsh punishment, you'll deter people, and make them think twice. Same goes for anyone leaving anything/anyone in a car.	1	291.0	66.0	311.0
312	9	That makes sense, but the difficulty would be convincing the local prosecutor to take on the case, and the rest of the police force to be willing to provide evidence	2	291.0	95.0	811.0
320	0	Well? What did you think	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	1	Well, I guess it's sad that a wolf died but I feel like there is more to the story that's not mentioned than just someone shooting a wolf...	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	10	I agree as well. I just think that we should all be loving and not killing.	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	11	Of course but there are many times that it's acceptable in my opinion	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	12	do you think its acceptable if a lion is attacking you to shoot it?	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	13	yes of course. 100% do you not?	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	14	Definitely if my life is on the line , it should be shot	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	15	Exactly. Animals are unpredictable unfortunately in any capacity.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	16	It's a shame really, animals are so beautiful	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	17	Yes they are. I think it would hit more at home if maybe it was a dog or cat for me.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	18	Exactly. Well it was nice talking to you, bye!	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	19	goodbye.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	2	I just feel bad because the wolf has a family ya know	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	3	Not really though. Wolves actually usually separate from their pack when they are looking for a mate and that's what this wolf was doing. It's still sad of course but the wolf may have been near humans and could have actually killed humans.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	4	Wow i didn't know that, very interesting. I just feel bad that humans can do such acts.	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	5	It is scary how easy some people can carry out these tasks.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	6	 These tasks should never be easy, they should be hard. The fact that people can do it so easily just disgusts me	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	7	Well, it is a wild animal that could and probably would have attacked a human if a human was near by. For me, a humans life is far above an animals life.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
320	8	They are equal in my opinion. I just love animals too much	1	39.0	70.0	319.0
320	9	Well we can agree to disagree. I would never put an animals life above another humans or my own.	2	39.0	84.0	819.0
343	0	That's really unfortunate about the situation in Kenya, it's crazy how it feels like everywhere you turn, there's another humanitarian crisis going on.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	1	I know, I don't understand why nothing much is being done.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	10	Right.  It's incredibly hard to band together in situations like this, there's so many different people vying for power.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	11	I'm not great on the history of Africa, but I know we've heard of several warlords turned presidents who have just been terrible.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	12	Yeah.  That's what kind of confused me about the article.  I couldn't tell which side, if any, the UN supported.  Seemed like the rebels may have been the good guys, as it mentioned the government was raping people...	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	13	I was trying to understand that too. I've had friends who have gone over there to do charity work, fortunately nothing like that happened to any of them.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	14	Yikes.  I really respect people like that who are willing to go and help.  Takes a lot of guts and courage.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	15	Most definitely, and I think it's key, rather than just throwing a few dollars at the problem. There needs to be a long-term commitment to helping these countries grow.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	16	Yeah it's much harder, but much more effective to give your time towards a cause, as opposed to your dollars.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	17	I think the BIll & Melinda Gates Foundation is doing a lot too, trying to come up with cheap ways to help the health and infrastructure of the poorest places.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	18	Aren't they heavy into trying to solve Malaria or something?	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	19	Very much so, it's become his personal mission to eradicate it.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	2	It sounds like there just aren't enough people willing.  The UN sends their peacekeepers, but they're still dependent on soldiers, and no countries are willing to send theirs.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	20	That's cool.  I'm not trying to sound like a bitter betty, but I wonder what portion of his fortune he's giving, in relation to a normal person's income?	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	21	It's actually quite large, and he's convinced a lot of other billionaires to give half their fortunes when they die. He's no longer the richest man because of how much he's given away, it's impressive.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	22	Wow.  Not related, but I read some thing about how Bezos's fortune, before the divorce, if made into one dollar bills could go to the moon and back like four times, then get stacked nine km high or something like that.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	23	Lol I can't imagine, I've been more or less poor my whole life. Bee tee dubs we can end this conversation now unless you want to go for bonus, but I think then we have to be on topic.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	24	I'm good to go, great talking to you fellow poor person! bye.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	25	You too! goodbye	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	3	But why? It's largely the fault of the Western World to begin with, historically.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	4	Lol everything that's wrong with the world today could probably be attributed to the Western civ in one way or another.  That's probably the point though, the Western people are selfish.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	5	Ture enough. I think about how much the Dutch are still exploiting for diamonds, for example.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	6	"Yeah, it seems like for the most part all those former European powers have vacated their, ""colonies"" now, and the void of leadership has caused chaos in these countries."	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	7	"Plus the fact that they were ""held down"" for a long time, because it suited the colonial powers."	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
343	8	Yeah.  Hopefully with time, these nations will become stable.  It seems like there are many that are.	1	186.0	92.0	342.0
343	9	I think that in the absence of solid help from us they need to band together, unforunately they have more than their share of opportunists as well.	2	186.0	83.0	842.0
349	0	hey what did you think of that article	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	1	I thought it was a pretty well written, but I wonder who is supposed to receive our empathy... the children or the smokers?	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	10	I wish but I know that would be so hard to do maybe more education for parents about how much it effects kids	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	11	Well, maybe. But really just educating the politicians should be enough, right? They could then pass the law	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	12	yeah but the amount of backlash people would have about it being there own home i think educating parents would be a great step maybe at prediatricians offices	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	13	WHy do you think, though, that there hasn't been the backlash for that really...	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	14	I dont think i understand the question backlash for the house law>	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	15	I mean, backlash for the car law.	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	16	oh okay, i see your point maybe because its still kind of public others can see im not to sure	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	17	Back to the kids, what about their current suffering - do you think the smoke is dramatically affecting them, or marginally?	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	18	there little bodys and influences probably drastically! well I have to go great talking to you! bye	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	19	bye	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	2	I think it is suppose to make you choose, I can see both sides but I really have to side with the children	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	3	I agree with that. It is good to protect the kids.	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	4	Yeah there bodys are so fragile as is	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	5	As they are developing it is important to make sure they can develop safely.	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	6	I agree I think this kind of law should be everywhere	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	7	What do you think of the law about preventing parents smoking in the car they own?	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
349	8	I love that, personally my father went outside to smoke and never smoked with us in the car but my friends parents did and I would feel so sick after being in there car no child should suffer through it	1	113.0	96.0	348.0
349	9	I agree with this too. Do you think it should extend to homes?	2	113.0	76.0	848.0
352	0	Good morning or afternoon. What was your initial thought on this article?	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	1	I think its at least a good sign that they are trying to find a solution.	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	10	Interesting because that was my other point I wanted to make. I am a generally liberal person. Certainly on a social level, but I also think a regulated and conscientious welfare system benefits the greater society... but I will be damned if reading a story like this doesn't make me at least understand the feelings of those people who want small government.	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	11	I think the people that want small government go to the extremes though. They want basically no government and that would be hard to live without.	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	12	Absolutely. I fundamentally believe a truly democratic government would struggle supporting leaders that make these types of decisions in this article.... but then again, we got a Trump, so I don't know...	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	13	Oh man I still don't know how Trump got elected...	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	14	"I felt blindsided that night. I didn't cry, but I was absolutely shocked. And I am really over the ""I told you sos."" Just for reference, the anti-vax neighbor is also a big Trump supporter hahaha... Anyway. back to the article - I don't understand how an organization like WHO doesn't have more ability to assist in this situation."	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	15	Why am I not surprised that someone anti-vax is a Trump supporter haha. And yeah, it seems to me that a lot of these organizations don't have the power they should have in these situations.	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	16	I saw that and then you see how the UN actually brought the epidemic. It's all such a mess. (This is turn 9 of 10 btw).	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	17	Yeah hopefully they can get this mess sorted out. And yeah should we end it now? It's been a good talk by the way enjoyed it!	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	18	One more round (be sure to stay and answer the extra question). I do hope the best. As a parent I really do have a lot of feelings for what these communities are going through.	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	19	Couldn't imagine being a parent and not having proper healthcare access  for them	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	2	I agree. There are so many things this article brings up in me. I think the first is the access to vaccines, their use, and extrapolated to my situation as an American - the current anti-vaccine movement. This doctors had to go through hoops to get a vaccine for a dying population, and we take it so much for granted here that we have a significant group of people undermining the entire concept of vaccinations.	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	20	It's awful. We were on the marketplace for years and that was awful - $7k deductible! ANyway. It has been nice. Have a good day. bye	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	21	have a great day. bye	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	3	Agreed that we take it for granted here, to have some people hate vaccines like they do	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	4	I think of my son, who is 8, and the possibility that he will be exposed to something, and it makes me frustrated. Our neighbors and anti-vaccine and they have a peer for my son. I don't think they understand that a vaccine works when the community uses it. When there are people who exempt themselves, it creates problems with the strategy to eradicate a disease. Then I think of these poor kids who are just trying to get through each day. Not only dealing with dirty water, but also no vaccine...	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	5	have you heard about the re-emerging diseases because people arent taking vaccines	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	6	Absolutely. OK, that neighbor used to work in my office. She quit, then sued us for harrasment because we didn't let her work from home full time after having a baby. THEN she moved in next door and the first thing that happened was that her son got whooping cough - which is in the vaccines. The poor kid looked like death and was still going to school like it was nothing. That was the day I started driving my son to school every day - just in case.	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	7	jesus you would think once her kid got that whooping cough she'd realize maybe the vaccines aren't so bad after all. People like that ruin it for the rest of us.	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
352	8	I agree. I think I got over empathic and took over the conversation with my personal story haha. What else did you feel in the article?	1	116.0	76.0	351.0
352	9	its fine I like to hear stories like that lol. Also, I feel like when the Haitian government said no to distributing vaccines, that was just terrible to read.	2	116.0	71.0	851.0
361	0	Hello, that was a sad article.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	1	It was terrible. I feel so bad for the girl.	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	10	I didn't hear about that, sounds a bit sketchy. I wonder if there's any charity or something that can help that girl?	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	11	I'm sure there are some out there. I can't even imagine having sight and next thing you know, you're blind. It's horrible	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	12	I think that if there were more publicity/press coverage here of these kind of things, they might happen less.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	13	yeah, i never hear anything about this. All you see are celeb gossip and things of that nature	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	14	Exactly. I don't think most people here even know that there's tension in Kashmir on a daily basis.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	15	Sad to say but i definitely didn't know. I hope that girl is able to live a decent life	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	16	I hate to say it but I kind of doubt it. Women are not in a great position in that society to begin with, marriage is very important.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	17	Totally forgot about the position she's in. Great point. Well let's just hope she's able to find a great husband!	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	18	Sad that we're saying something like that in modern times. Yes, hopefully things work out for her.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	19	Just shows that we're not really improving as humans. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	2	I'm not sure why Indian security forces are firing on civilians, it wasn't stated.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	20	You too, bye	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	3	I think there was just tension and war in the area and the girl was caught in a bad situation	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	4	I know that Kashmir has been a big problem area for a long time, it flares up now and again.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	5	It's just sad that a civilian that has done no harm gets caught in something like this.	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	6	The other thing is the weapons they're using - kind of like shotguns, it's so random.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	7	That's a great point. War sucks cuz civilian casualties are almost a guarantee	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
361	8	You would think that India would take a more benevolent attitude towards a disputed region.	1	163.0	83.0	360.0
361	9	Agreed. I think i recently saw some news that US is sending in drones that killed a couple hundreds of civilians as well	2	163.0	70.0	860.0
367	0	What did you think about the article?	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	1	I thought it was a little aggressively written but it got the point across.	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	10	I honestly don't even know but it does seem like forever. We should feel so grateful that we don't have to live life like those people. I can't even imagine	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	11	Me too! Do you live in the US?	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	12	Yup! I'm just glad to have a roof over my head. You?	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	13	Same! It definitely makes you appreciate countries like are more when you think about what it could be.	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	14	Have you ever traveled out of the US?	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	15	Yes I went to Germany once and some of the surrounding countries. They were all really nice and full of culture. I haven't been to any like none 1st world countries. Hbu?	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	16	I've been to Thailand but even though it's third world, it's definitely not like the situation that we read in the article	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	17	Yah that makes sense, did you go to like the touristy areas?	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	18	Yup mostly visited temples. Looks like that's 10 turns, nice talking to you! bye	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	19	bye!	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	2	Agree. I just think that war in general is so terrible.	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	3	"Me too... It's sad too that people try so hard to help, like those doctors and stuff, but there will always be some ""bad guy"" undoing that and making things worse it seems."	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	4	Yeah.. and the families of those that are in war. All they can do is worry and grieve	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	5	Yes, they must feel very hopeless	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	6	It's also sad to know that tehre is absolutely nothing we can do about this.	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	7	Yah not people like you or me... At some point it has to be up to the higher ups and the people in charge over there.	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
367	8	Hopefully they do something because so many innocent people are getting hurt and it's so unfair	1	80.0	70.0	366.0
367	9	Agreed... How long has this kind of stuff even been going on? it seems like forever	2	80.0	68.0	866.0
376	0	What did you think about this article	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	1	I think it is absolutely disgusting that a pair of parents could do that to their children personally, and i think she should not forgive them or even be in contact with them for what they did.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	10	yah thats true	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	11	What makes me upset is thinking about why she would even do this in the first place. I can only imagine she needs the money from the show or something cause why face these people.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	12	That's true, usually people with childhood tramua such as that struggle with holding steady jobs and their finances. So she probably doesn't want the whole world to know those secrets but now they do because she needs the money most likely.	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	13	maybe she has just come to terms with the experience and now sees it as a paycheck that can also help her get some closure. But yeah that makes sense. I also think it is awful how the mother is claiming it was all the fathers idea and she just gave in to his idea after three months, you don't just become okay with the idea of abusing your child.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	14	True a good mother would like divorce or be strongly against the husband/father for even bringing that up in the first place. I would be beyond disgusted if my husband said anything like that	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	15	Exactly or report him to the police or try to get him help, but to give in? Absolutely disgusting and for her to try and just shrug it off as his idea shows she did not learn anything in prison and is still rotten to the core.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	16	Agreed... she is just as at fault as she is. Parents are supposed to protect, not enable or roll over and let evil things happen	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	17	Exactly, it really makes me wonder why she was even released from prison if she did not improve or was not rehabilitated in any way  since she clearly doesn't show true remorse.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	18	"Yah... Also why, if she was ""less' at fault, did they get the same sentence length? IMO life would have been enough for both. There's no reason people like that need freedom and to have the opportunity to hurt someone else."	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	19	I agree there are certain people who cannot be redeemed and crimes that cannot be forgiven and this is definitely one of them.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	2	Agreed! It's awful. I can't believe they only got 20 years.	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	20	Agreed. It's been great talking but I think we at 20+ turns right?	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	21	10+ 2 messages count as one turn, but yes it was nice talking to you. bye	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	22	goodbye	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	3	That was what i was thinking too, 20 years for scaring your child forever and sexually abusing them. Do you think they have really reconciled with what they did?	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	4	No I think if someone is evil enough to do that, that evil can't go away. They may have buried it or learned to hide it, but that is evil at it core.	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	5	I agree, it just goes against too many natural instincts that we as humans have. To think that they could look at their child and only see the money that they could gain from it digusts me. And honestly the fact that they even allowed the mother or father to go on the show seems very wrong to me also.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	6	Exactly! Yah that seems like a grab for views which is sad on Dr Phils part. He should have focused on the abusee and trying to help her.	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	7	Definitely,  i know that their show is about making money and saying that the abuser and abusee will confront each other is good for views but i just think about how their parents are once again profiting from their childs abuse and it just makes my skin crawl.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
376	8	Ew that's true, I didn't even think about them profitting. That's even worse. I wonder if the daughter will even think it's worth it at that point	1	91.0	68.0	375.0
376	9	I don't personally see how it could be but if it gets her any closure or helps her then i guess it is fine.	2	91.0	72.0	875.0
381	0	What did you think about this artivel	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	1	I just feel awful the way these people suffered and died	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	10	hopefully the government or that company offer some.	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	11	yeah and some assistance to the families that have lost loved one	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	12	Yes for sure... they shouldn't have to pay any of those bills	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	13	i agree and i wonder what the town looks like after such a big explosion probably needs to be rebuilt somewhat	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	14	that's true... do you think there are laws in place that will make them pay for this? I hope so	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	15	no with s place that you randomly get gas on the side of the road from a truck i bet there laws are iffy	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	16	that was kind of my thoughts too.... and those people who that happened too were probably not well off...	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	17	yeah probably very poor lived a not great life then died suffering so sad	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	18	it's awful.... and even worse that with not a lot of laws in place probably, this could happen again and again	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	19	yes true i think this should be on the news and some aid should come help and set up laws	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	2	Me too... i wonder how long they could feel it for before they died	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	20	agreed. then maybe bigger countries could chime in an help. would you like to keep talking for 5 more turns	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	21	yes I would like thar, i think bigger countries have responsibility to guide small poorer countries	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	22	i thnk so too because they have the experience	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	23	yes and resouces these people dont	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	24	exactly. what else could they do to help you think? send like guidance people down	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	25	yeah maybe create a task force to aid the social and economical aspect of it	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	26	that's a good idea. And we could send them down to prevent events like that not just after them	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	27	yup a preventative task force train them and then eventually they will have the tools and knowledge to do it themsleves	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	28	that would be great. I wonder if anythign like that is in place already? Probably is but it's not that great	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	29	yeah i dont know something needs to be done so this doesnt happen yet again they dont need this death toll with in the society	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	3	i know especially the ones that ran off and just waited in mysery	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	30	agreed! it's been nice talking to you goodbye	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	31	goodbye!	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	4	yah that sounds awful.... I wonder if this could have been preventsed	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	5	yeah it sounds like the way these people get gas should be more regulated	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	6	I agree... I hope they do something to prevent this happeneing again	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	7	yes, me two this was such a mass casuality they need to do something	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
381	8	Agreed... and think of all the people that saw the even happen. I bet they are traumatized.	1	23.0	68.0	380.0
381	9	yes especially the workers that came to help and these people were in so much pain and suffering they must need therapy	2	23.0	96.0	880.0
387	0	what did you think about this article	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	1	It's really sad, but I'm so glad no one was killed!	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	10	true, it would not be worth it for simple things like some inhalation.	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	11	I wonder how the people outside the apartment got hurt. There was an explosion, right? I wouldn't want to get caught in that.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	12	Maybe like debris flying or something like that? It said minor so they probably just got knicked with something	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	13	Yeah, I think only one person had to go to the hospital, so the explosion must have happened in an area a decent distance from the inhabitants.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	14	That would make sense yah, which is good. It probably means the building was like set up like it was supposed to be, safety wise and all	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	15	Yeah. I wonder if they had to find somewhere else to live, at least while the investigation's underway?	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	16	Hopefully they did, i didn't think about that. I hope there is some sort of law or policy in place that the landlord would have to pay for a hotel for them or something	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	17	It'd definitely be the respectable thing to do. I wonder if any of the building was salvageable.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	18	Hopefully so... it didn't have much detail on all that. and hopefully not a lot of people's stuff was ruined! that would suck	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	19	Ooooh, yeah, that would be awful! Especially if you'd lived there a long time and had lots of memories and stuff. :(	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	2	Right? I thought it would be way worse initially. Still sad but could have been so so much worse	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	20	I know! To just have it all be gone in a moment, no warning. That would really really suck, on top of being injured and not having a place to stay.	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	21	Eeeep. My worst nightmare :/	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	22	Same here....and those things can't be brought back with time or money.	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	23	Yeah. :( Well, I think that's about everything... did anything else in the article strike you?	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	24	do you want to go for like three more turns to get the bonus? We could talk about insurance on it and stuff	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	25	Sure, that's fine! I know most people have to have rental insurance; does that cover fire damage?	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	26	When I had mine it did, and it would cover the cost to replace any damaged or destroyed items	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	27	That's good, hopefully everyone involved will have that. I wonder if the people just on the street will get anything for health insurance.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	28	I hope so too... I know a lot of my friends who rent don't. Which is silly cause it's like 10 bucks a month. They probably could get it covered by the property owners insurance	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	29	Eep, that's not a good idea. Renter's insurance is super cheap comparatively and can save you a lot of heartache. I had a pipe on the washing machine break one time and it flooded the whole floor. No insurance would've been a nightmare.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	3	Yeah. I feel like as soon as I hear any bad news these days I immediately brace for the worst.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	30	Oh yes that would have been awful! Even just for the peace of mind it's worth it. I think that is 15 turns. Are you ready to be done?	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	31	Yep, I'm good. :) It was great talking with you!	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	32	you too! goodbye!	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	33	bye!	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	4	Same...I wonder what caused it	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	5	Oh, I guess it didn't say, did it? That's odd. I feel like a gas leak is usually the suspect.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	6	I dont think so.... and yah that would seem most common. I wonder if anyone will sue the landlord. I would haha	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	7	Haha, probably depends on what they can afford, honestly. If only eight people were inside it must have been small.	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
387	8	That's true.... I've always had bad landlords, but if it were a nice guy who I knew I might think twice and just be glad it wasn't worse	1	66.0	68.0	386.0
387	9	Yeah. I feel like it would also depend on how bad my injuries were — like, are we talking smoke inhalation or 3rd degree burns?	2	66.0	67.0	886.0
391	0	what did you think about this articel	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	1	I thought it was sad just due to the massive loss of life, what did you think?	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	10	I hope something will be done to punish those people that caused this	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	11	Yes, although I would say it seems unlikely.  It seems like these things tend to go unpunished, like the factories in INdia that collapse and kill hundreds of workers	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	12	Yah they do have a track record of that... Probably pay someone off or something	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	13	Yeah, it seems especially bad in certain countries	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	14	Yes, the poorer ones, where the officials in charge have way too much power	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	15	Yes, and there is always so much corruption amongst those in power	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	16	For sure... so sad, money over human lives	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	17	Yeah, that is the ultimate tragedy right there	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	18	And the two people who survived, I bet they are traumatized	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	19	I'm sure they are.  What a horrible thing to go through.  Well it has been nice speaking to you, I must go.  goodbye	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	2	I think it's awful... So much loss. and it could have been prevented	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	20	goodbye	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	3	Yes seriously, these mines are too dangerous	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	4	Agreed, and they could be so much safer if they had just put in the vetilation. But they were trying to be cheap.	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	5	Yep, sounds so typical.  Putting profits over the lives of humans	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	6	23 humans... that's a small number but think about that. 23 whole people. 23 families. all so someone could get a little bit richer.	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	7	Yeah, I was feeling awful for the families.  They all lost a husband, a father	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
391	8	Yup.. and somebody lost a son or grandson	1	270.0	68.0	390.0
391	9	Yep, exactly!!!  That is just terrible.	2	270.0	73.0	890.0
396	0	What did you think about this article	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	1	I think it was interesting the women went to have sex with him and then changed their mind	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	10	OK and I could agree with that for the most part.	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	11	yea sometimes both parties are equally drunk now say the girl after the fact changes her mind and thinks you know what I was too drunk maybe I was raped	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	12	and I get that, and those are the iffy situations especially if both parties are drunk. But those aren't the majority of cases. and then it's mindsets like that that can hurt or delay the real victims getting the help they need	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	13	I agree but we live in a victim culture now where everyone is offended and victimized I think we are letting it get out of hand and the women who are bringing up frivoulous cases are hindering the real victims of sexual abuse	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	14	I agree with the second part of that yah... They are doing an injustice to the real victims.	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	15	the me too movement bought up legitemate cases but many women saw an opportunity at a paycheck as well taking away from the message	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	16	Yup... but that is the same kind of case with a lot of things. Like that chick who spilt hot coffee all over her and sued mcdonalds. A lot of people tried to follow in suit for silly things like that, and it made real suing cases seem less real	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	17	lawsuits american as apple pie	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	18	haha yup	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	19	justice for the rich chains for the poor	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	2	Interesting how? They changed their mind because he started choking them and being aggressive	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	20	yup. And it makes it harder than it should be for the real victims.	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	21	sure doues	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	22	"I feel bad for these girls though... because see like we were talking about, some of the first thougths were ""maybe they were lying or weren't sure"""	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	23	I do too nice chatting goodbye	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	24	bye	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	3	they should have never been there	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	4	They were having consensual sex. and then changed their mind. There is nothing wrong with that. are you trying to blame them?	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	5	there needs to be a sex waiver form with check lists	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	6	"No people need to know what the words ""no"" and ""stop"" mean. Simple as that."	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	7	also sign a waiver though and record all sexual acts	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
396	8	I mean if you think it's neccesary but you'd have to be pretty bad at understanding situations. I just hope you are not trying to blame these girls. he RAPED them. It's all on him	1	368.0	68.0	395.0
396	9	no this guy sounds like a creep but there are other situations where its not this clear cut	2	368.0	78.0	895.0
400	0	Hello what u think about the article	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	1	I think that it's a sad story it seems like we hear all too often...	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	10	definitely! I hope he gets what he deserves	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	11	Me too... And I hope the women he hurt get justice	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	12	I hope they aren't scarred for life.	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	13	They might be.. but knowing he's behind bars and got what he deserves might help	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	14	I agree. I just wonder how can someone be so tempted that they'd be willing to commit a crime	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	15	I think rage or evilness... like they want to hurt people	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	16	Yeah, let's hope people are better in the future and we evolve as humans.	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	17	Agreed... it's so barbaric and unhumane	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	18	It was nice talking to you!! bye	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	19	bye	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	2	It's terrible that someone can do this to others..	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	3	Agreed... I really hope people don't try to victime blame this poor woman	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	4	Do you think people like this should be put behind bars forever	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	5	Totally! if you are evil enough to do it once, you'll do it again	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	6	I agree! I believe he sexually assaulted multiple women as well	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	7	Yes, so even more reason... I don't get how someone can be that evil	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
400	8	I wonder if people are just born that way.	1	368.0	70.0	399.0
400	9	They could be, or how they were raised im sure plays a big role	2	368.0	68.0	899.0
403	0	It is truly unfortunate that this kind of stuff happens on an almost daily basis. I couldn't imagine being that boy's dad.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	1	Ugh, I can't even imagine. To know your kid is just forty feet away and you... you can't get to him.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	10	It's a true wake up call for most I'm sure.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	11	Life is precious. I wonder what will happen to the well now, since i guess it's torn up.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	12	It really is. I don't understand the people who don't see it as that. Hopefully either restored completely or torn down completely but it is China so I'm sure safety standards are slightly different	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	13	Yeah. Or even in the US standards are a little different if you're in a rural area.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	14	Yes that's very true. I can relate. I'm out in the country but born and raised in a larger city and it still surprises me the differences here.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	15	Opposite here -- born and raised country, moved towards the city. Good and bad things to both.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	16	Yes of course. I just wonder how different it is in China.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	17	Yeah. It sounds like it was a freak accident, and if they dug all around it, I don't know if it's even usable. For that matter, what would you need a well with a hole that small to start with?	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	18	That's very true. It could have been an unused well that was already in bad shape.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	19	Yeah, and it just kinda got grown over. I guess it was in the middle of their farm though, if they were getting vegetables?	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	2	Exactly. His dad probably always took him out to help him work and he'd never imagine how unfortunate he'd be that day.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	20	They may have not even realized it was there until it's too late. Sad to think this could happen to anyone.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	21	Indeed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article?	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	22	No, I think we've exhausted most thoughts. goodbye	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	23	bye!	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	3	I mean, what are the odds? It was only a foot wide; the kid had to have fallen just so to even fit.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	4	Very true. It just makes you really think about how lucky some of us are to be alive. Freak accidents happen everyday to people who I think don't deserve it.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	5	Yeah, for sure. I hope the kid died on impact. Waiting in the dark, injured, would be awful. :(	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	6	Yes that's true. Especially if his dad was just a few feet away having to basically hear his child die.	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	7	Ugh, nope, no. On the one hand at least then the kid could hear his dad's voice, but on the other... nope.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
403	8	Yeah, not ideal either way. I would not be able to live with myself if I had to endure either way. Just hopelessness I'm sure	1	92.0	84.0	402.0
403	9	It's humbling how we can do so much and yet be thwarted by just a too-small hole.	2	92.0	67.0	902.0
404	0	what did you thingk about this article	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	1	It's horrible. I can	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	10	I think so too...	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	11	Really, I'm having a hard time discussing this story because it's just too hard to think about. It is just so sad. I can't imagine if this happened to one of my children.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	12	Honestly same here.... I could never stop thinking about the what ifs... Or how long he lived for down there.	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	13	I know, it's heart wrenching.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	14	I'm glad thought that the workers did all they could... it's good they tried	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	15	That's true, I'm sure they probably worked night and day.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	16	Which I'm sure made it harder to find that boy. the way he was... but easier to live with knowing they did all they could	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	17	Hopefully they can have peace with it. I'm sure they did all they could.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	18	me too	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	19	It's been good talking to you and thanks for trying to find some positive in the situation!	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	2	It's super sad... I can't imagine what that little boy went through	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	20	you as well! bye	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	21	bye	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	3	Yeah, that's what I was going to say but I accidentally hit enter. I can't imagine what he went through and his family. It sounds horrible, but I hope for him that he died quickly and wasn't in the well scared for days.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	4	I hope so too, I wish the article had said...	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	5	Me too, but I am kind of grateful the article didn't give a lot of details. It's just terrifying.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	6	It is... I feel bad for the workers too... It must have been devastating to find	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	7	I wonder if his dad knew that the well was there. He probably feels so guilty either way since the boy was helping him when it happened.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
404	8	I wondered that too... And yes that would be so so hard to live with	1	92.0	68.0	403.0
404	9	I don't think it said how old the boy was either. I thought it just said young.	2	92.0	98.0	903.0
406	0	what did you think about this article	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	1	I'm surprised that the gap is not close to closing. How about you?	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	10	Yes that is true, there are physcial limitations that are harder for women to achieve in some jobs. BUt they should still have an opportunity at them	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	11	I agree with that.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	12	I also think it's sad women aren't advancing in their careers as much as men. All the women i know in power positions work just as hard or harder than their male counterparts	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	13	I agree, but this system was not built was everybody in mind so its going to take a while to change it.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	14	Yes... probably longer than everyone would like. It makes me sad as a women in the workforce, trying to advance. ANd I am in Electrical so it's a very male driven workforce	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	15	As a man, I'm glad that you are doing what makes you happy and as a father of three girls I'm happy to see women push into uncharted territory	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	16	Thank you! It is a great caree	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	17	I know it pays good too.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	18	yes it does!	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	19	I'm too much of a scary cat to touch electric.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	2	me too, i was surprised that it is growing, as that is not what i see in field	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	20	haha it is kind of scary at first! But once you get shocked a time or too i think your body realizes it's not that bad. Luckily right now I do residential so there isn't a ton of high voltage	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	21	Good lucky with your career and it was very nice chatting with you! bye.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	22	you as well :) bye!	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	3	Yeah, to me it's simple equal pay for equal work.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	4	Yup... I don't get why it can't be implented or why there cant' be some sort of check in place	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	5	That should be a simple law to pass	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	6	You'd think... I also think it's sad that a country as advanced as the US can't figure it out. It should be a priority. We are 51% of the country afterall	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	7	I think we think we are advanced but we are behind the times on a lot of things.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
406	8	Agreed, especially in this area. IMO it's because there are so many more men running the country than women. It is just not as important to them	1	331.0	68.0	405.0
406	9	Agreed. I do think some jobs by their nature will have more men than women working them. Like firefighters, If a woman can pass the physical part of the job then she should have it.	2	331.0	75.0	905.0
409	0	what did you think about this read	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	1	I guess I think that restructuring society in a more egalitarian fashion is going to take a lot longer than it should.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	10	I think that head people should be making it known that they are actively working on it, and actually do so	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	11	Simple enough. Do you think it is in the hands of businesses and corporations to spearhead the change, or does the responsibility lie with the public, or both?	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	12	I think both, but mainly with businesses and such	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	13	I think they definitely have the greatest capacity to incite social change, but also the biggest incentive to maintain the status quo.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	14	Agreed... There'd almost have to be some sort of incentive	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	15	Like a carbon tax, but for gender inequality.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	16	yah exatly	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	17	Do you think it's a realistic goal? Or, do you think it's overly idealistic to attempt to overthrow centuries of social norms and inequality?	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	18	I think it is a very big goal, that we would have to go about slowly... unfortunately	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	19	I agree. Thanks for chatting with me today! bye	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	2	Agreed... there's no real rhyme or reason this is still such an issue	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	20	bye	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	3	I equate it to self help for an entire species. People just can't be bothered to do anything about it until it gets out of hand.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	4	That is a good viewpoint... I also feel like the disadvantage of it only being half the species dealing with the gap plays a role	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	5	That's a very good point actually. Most men are content to sit on their hands on this particular issue.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	6	for sure! And fixing the gap could result in lower pay for them, so why would they want to help fix it	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	7	I honestly don't think it would result in lower pay. That's one of the scare tactics used by anti-feminists to scare men into their belief system. The same is used as a foil for affirmative action and other progressive initiatives.	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
409	8	That's interesting to hear... makes sense though	1	331.0	68.0	408.0
409	9	It's just that diversity in the workforce actually creates more opportunities in the long run for all concerned instead of filling up a limited number of spaces. What do you think should be done to stimulate the closing of the gender gap?	2	331.0	74.0	908.0
412	0	hey what did you think of the article	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	1	I think that it's sad... it makes me worry more and more about the ocean. what did you think	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	10	agreed i think once it's to late they are going to be very sorry	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	11	Or we are... I just wish that people wouldn't forget about this stuff a week after it happens. We need to stay on it and care about it and force them to change something	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	12	yeah i remember about learning of that big one when i was in elementary school and all the animals it killed and that was so long ago i was suprised it effected the same capacity now	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	13	Oh yah, I think that was the one that kind of like first started the trend of them appearinig in the news. I can't remember the name of it. started with an O?	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	14	yeah i honestly cant remember either just how hard of an impact it had then that big one with i think shell	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	15	Yah I remember that... it probably wwas like it is now... A big fuss and first and then everyone forgot so they did nothing	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	16	yeah swept under the rug its so sad	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	17	very sad.... i wonder if theres an organazition for this sorta stuff. you'd think there would be	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	18	yeah there should be a central one would probably make it easier to fix	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	19	yah. Then there could be like  a task force when this sort of stuff happens	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	2	its so sad i feel for these innocent animals	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	20	that is a great idea i wonder if you could write congress or something some advice	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	21	I could probably look into it online and see. There might already be one. I wouldn't be surprised!	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	22	that would be a great idea no harm in trying!	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	23	I think i will look into it haha cause no I am curious.	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	24	wow that's great see some good can come from a sad article haha	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	25	Yes i'm glad we talked about all this. It's kind of interesting to talk in depth about stuff and think about it more than base level.	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	26	i agree it's nice to step out of your own little bubble once and a while	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	27	yes and hear new ideas or get some different opinions	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	28	one voice can change the world in my opinion just need to put ideas in motion	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	29	yes very true!!	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	3	Me too... I wish the goverments would do more to prevent this	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	30	well i had a really great chat with you!	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	31	I had a great chat with you as well! Goodbye	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	32	bye!	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	4	me to and act more quickly after it happens	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	5	Agreed. IT seems like we never hear about the aftermath of this or the punishment	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	6	yeah you would think by now with so many oil spills there would be more done	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	7	Right? They are all over it if it's their paycheck on the line, but things liek this seem to have no resolution in sight\	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
412	8	yup true and with it impacting species in danger of extinction how is it not a bigger priority	1	112.0	96.0	411.0
412	9	That's a good point. Things like that can't wait, they should be acting quick.	2	112.0	68.0	911.0
423	0	What did you think of the article?	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	1	I think it's sad... I don't get why people do stuff like that	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	10	Yeah. Poor guy. :( I wonder what the rest of his flock is like.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	11	Aw they probably will miss him I did not think about that.	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	12	I know elephants mourn their dead for a long time. I wonder if flamingos are the same. :(	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	13	I'm sure most animals can mourn in some sense.... That's sad. I also worry for the people around this guy. Because if he thinks that is ok to do in public, what does he think is ok to do behind closed doors?	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	14	Yeah, no kidding. It said he was with his family — I'd be worried for their safety, honestly. He's clearly capable of random acts of violence.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	15	Me too.... I'm sure for him to do that in public, he has done something like that before in private	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	16	Yeah. It's creepy that he'd already picked up a different flamingo. I wonder what was going through his head??	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	17	I wonder if there's some mental illness going on	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	18	Hard to say. I know that most people with mental illnesses are more likely to be abused than cause abuse, so idk if I'd want to stereotype, but. Yipes.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	19	Yah I don't want to sterotype either, just throwing it out there. Maybe he has suffered some sort of abuse, so his mind is more prone to thinking those actions areok	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	2	It just seems so senseless; I can't imagine why someone would do it.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	20	Yeah. Just sad all around, I guess. :(	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	21	For sure....	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	22	Well, if we've covered everything, it was nice talking to you. :) bye!	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	23	you too! bye	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	3	Me neither... Do you think his punishment was fair/	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	4	I honestly don't have much of a frame of reference, but $2K for an animal's life seems fair.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	5	I would agree for the most part... I think therapy or something else should be required too, because that is not the actions of an OK person	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	6	Yeah, agreed. And some kind of training/learning about animals.	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	7	Yes that's a good idea too.	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
423	8	I was surprised that the flamingo was 19. I wonder how old they can be?	1	133.0	67.0	422.0
423	9	I have no idea, but I would assume that's an older flamingo, probably getting up there in age.	2	133.0	68.0	922.0
425	0	what did you think about this read	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	1	It was really sad.   Why would any human being kill a flamingo in a zoo	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	10	Yup... all trapped behind screens. We're all so desensitzed	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	11	"School shootings are interpreted as ""oh another shooting"" when children are dead or severely injured"	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	12	Right? It's like people see them as just another normal news story	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	13	It really bothers me - people seldom help others anymore.	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	14	Yah I've noticed that too... We either think they are not deserving of help or think that we'renot in a position to help, when most likely we are	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	15	We are - the numbers of people that are homeless or living in welfare situations are now viewed if they would only try - so much more they won't accept.   Mental illness is part of homelessness and poverty is a result that our wages are not keeping up with what it just costs to live anymore.	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	16	Yes! But no one can afford help for their mental illness! Minimum wage hasn't gone up in 10 years... how crazy is that	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	17	Very crazy when housing has gone up from 25-50%.    No healthcare - no family to check on their state of mind.   I see many veterans that need so much.	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	18	Me too... but yet we as a country seem to be able to afford to help other countries	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	19	I know.  Makes no sense.    It's been so nice chatting with you.    goodbye	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	2	i have no idea... some kind of evil in him	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	20	you too! bye	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	3	Something - the fine was way too small in my opinion	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	4	agreed... he killed an animal, for no reason, in public. Should have been a way harsher punisshment	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	5	Busch gardens is so beautiful - he must be psychopath since he hurts animals	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	6	I've never been there... do you think there were a lot of people around when he did it?	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	7	Normally it's packed - I'm sure people were videoing it but never stopped to help.   That kills me - videoing the attack but doing nothing	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
425	8	That would be awful... People have become so disassociated	1	133.0	68.0	424.0
425	9	They really have.   Humanity as we use to know is slowly slipping away	2	133.0	65.0	924.0
431	0	what did you think about this artivel	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	1	I think we've been seeing articles like this for far too long.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	10	What kind of foreign policy	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	11	Drone strikes and killing civilians.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	12	Oh yes I totally think it does. it gives them motives	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	13	I agree. I can't imagine coming home in the evening and finding my entire family killed. That kind of anger must be all consuming.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	14	It would be unimaginably awful..> and like you said, for what? Most americans can't tell you. I cant really	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	15	I think it's to prevent the expansion of ISIS and Al-Qaeda after the Iraq war, but even i'm not positive.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	16	I have heard something along those lines as well. You'd think the media would keep us more informed haha	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	17	Unfortunately, Trump and climate change have dominated the news cycle for the past three years. Most Americans know very little about what is going on abroad.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	18	I totally agree. that and memes, pointless celebrity news and drama, all to keep our focus off the important stuff, so they can make decisions and changes behind our back.	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	19	It's a race to the bottom. Well, thanks for chatting with me! bye	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	2	My thoughts too! It seems like it's been going on forever	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	20	bye!	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	3	Seems like the civilians always outnumber the soldiers too.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	4	Yes which is not a good thing....	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	5	I mean, the soldiers know what they signed up for. They pay the ultimate price in service of their country/ideology, but we're blowing apart entire families on a regular basis for a reason most Americans don't even remember anymore.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	6	That is a good way of putting it. I'm sure MOST of those soilders have good intentions but there could be some ill advised things hire up. And it's those civillians paying the consequences.	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	7	They have just started dropping bombs indiscriminately, very few strikes are based on reliable intel. I read a story yesterday that schools and hospitals are being hit. I believe that constitutes a war crime.	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
431	8	Oh no that's awful if it's true. I would think that would be a war crime yah	1	13.0	68.0	430.0
431	9	Do you believe that this kind of foreign policy encourages terrorism?	2	13.0	74.0	930.0
445	0	The situation in Syria is really a gut check, even from the perspective of a helpless bystander.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	1	For real... It's so hard to read about	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	10	Not generally, but lack of affordable healthcare is responsible for a lot of premature deaths especially among the unemployed and underemployed.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	11	That's a valid point... and workplace stress too... We have such a lack of working laws for being a developed country	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	12	But no shortage of laws and deterrents to keep people from forming unions that would demand equitable treatment for workers.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	13	Right? It's crazy how anti union places are. LIke it makes sense, for the business, but not for the individual workers supporting them.	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	14	In these uncertain times businesses have to focus on turning the largest profit in the shortest amount of time, I guess/	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	15	Yes... but at our cost	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	16	Always, but what can you do?	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	17	Honestly I have no idea.. it seems overwhelming to try to start as just one person	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	18	It's absolutely impossible. Well, thanks for chatting today. bye	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	19	bye	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	2	It blows my mind that there are any people still trying to eke out an existence there after this has been going on for almost a decade.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	3	Right? With how advanced we are in other countries, it's crazy to still see a country struggling like this	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	4	It's hard to progress when the governing body has dug in its heels and is content to murder its own citizenz.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	5	I have heard that a lot of times... That they do what is best for them, even if it costs the lives of their own	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	6	I think the mindset that they have is that the citizens are simply a resource to be exploited, like lumber or minerals.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	7	How awful is that...	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
445	8	It's actually not uncommon, the results in more advanced society just have lower fatality rates. Think about how replaceable the average American worker is.	1	7.0	74.0	444.0
445	9	That's very true... at least we don't generally die because of it	2	7.0	68.0	944.0
449	0	what did you think about htis read	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	1	It is sad that these two countries can not reach an agreement. What do you think?	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	10	Me neither.... like the entire worlds fate in one persons hand.. doesn't make sense	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	11	I agree, I bet they have bombs and weapons that we don't even know about.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	12	Oh yah for sure....	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	13	I worry about biological warfare	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	14	Yes I worry about that too... So many things oculd go wrong	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	15	It may get worst as resources get tighter.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	16	that's definitely a possibility	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	17	Do you think we will every have world peace?	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	18	Not in the near future no...	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	19	I agree	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	2	I think it's sad and scary	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	20	well it has been great chatting! goodbye	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	21	you too! bye	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	3	Yeah bombing are scary.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	4	nuclear war terrifies me	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	5	hopefully we will never find out.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	6	I hope not! It seems like countriies are always on the verge of using it	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	7	I agree with that, but I did mutual damage keeps them from being used.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
449	8	That is true... but if one dumb leader got angry enough think about what couldhappen	1	11.0	68.0	448.0
449	9	I do not like the fact in most countries they are controlled by one person.	2	11.0	75.0	948.0
451	0	poor kitten	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	1	 I know it's awful...	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	10	yes they do but do you think a minute spent to save animals is one less minute you could give to kids dying in chicago everyday	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	11	That is true, but you have to think, their drive is now for saving animals. They'll be more passionate and productive in that aspect. People are going to do what their going to do,i'll just be happy its a good thing they're doing.	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	12	I suppose personally I would kill all the kittens in america if it would ensure the life of one human child	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	13	That is hard to think about... But I think i could come to the same conclusion.	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	14	yea its tough but I value human life more then animal life like there is no way I would give money to any animal charity because there is still too much human suffering to solve first	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	15	I agree with that as well.. I think the amount americans spend on unneccary animal stuff is crazy when there are people starving to death or can't afford medical stuff	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	16	i know people are literally starving to death around the world everyday drinking dirty shit water while we spend billions on animals	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	17	I know, it's kind of crazy. I do think that we should still take care of animals and care about them, but not to the extent that a lot of people do. Like don't buy your dog a sweater or halloween outfit. Donate to a charity or something.	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	18	I agree with that nice chatting with you bye	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	19	bye!	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	2	yea it is people are sick	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	3	Like dumping a kitten is one thing, but wrapping it up the way he did? That's evil	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	4	probably some satanic ritual they like to use cats	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	5	Ew I didn't even think about that. It could be	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	6	yea they do all kinds of sick depraved acts to animals	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	7	Yah... I just don't get it. They  can feel pain just as much as us...	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
451	8	yea what do you think about the people trying to save these animals do you think they should spend their time to help human children first	1	182.0	78.0	450.0
451	9	I mean I think that all causes should be represented. Given children are more important, but animals need a voice too.	2	182.0	68.0	950.0
455	0	hey what are your thoughts on the article	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	1	It's super sad... I don't get how someone can do that to a cute kitten... hbu	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	10	I would be scarred for life!	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	11	me too....	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	12	there should be better laws in place to prevent this	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	13	Or even easier access to help for mental health... the person who did this obviously has issue	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	14	yes i agree so crazy	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	15	Do you think the police will do anything to find the guy	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	16	I hope so could lead to a serial killer	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	17	honestly could.. or he could start hurting people or his family if he has one	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	18	yup agreed! it was nice chatting today have to go! bye	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	19	bye	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	2	same like what goes through your head	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	3	I want them to find this person and punish him	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	4	me two there is no excuse for this behavior	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	5	like dropping it on the side of the raod is one thing... but tying it up just to hurt it is evil	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	6	exactly they wanted to see its suffer so terrible	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	7	I'm glad someone found it though	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
455	8	i cant imagine how traumatized that couple is	1	182.0	96.0	454.0
455	9	probably quite a bit... that had to have been hard to see	2	182.0	68.0	954.0
456	0	hey how did you feel about the article?	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	1	I think i've heard way too many of these stories..	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	10	true like a taser is usually a go to now	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	11	Yes, there are so many other options	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	12	hopefully they take a better loo at training	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	13	agreed... I hope the officer gets some sort of reprimand	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	14	im sure something big will come of it i hope	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	15	We can hope! It seems like they dont sometimes	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	16	true i think more diverse places care	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	17	Yes probably... I hope the women got some sort of like... not apology... but some sort of reconcilliation for it	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	18	yeah some sort of justice for the situation	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	19	exactly	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	2	who's side are you on>	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	20	its been nice talking to you bye	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	21	you as well bye	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	3	I could be on eitherdepending on the situation.	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	4	same i think i need to see more background and the video	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	5	agreed. It does sound like she was being unneccasrily resistant, but a punch to the face is still not a professional way to subdue someone.	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	6	both true the gathering crowd probably fueled it to	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	7	yes, it probably added tension for everyne	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
456	8	must have hurt really bad	1	371.0	96.0	455.0
456	9	Yah... I just think a punch is so aggressive. They are trained in how to take people down, and I'm sure a punch to the face is not part of that so much	2	371.0	68.0	955.0
459	0	what did you think about the article? I thought the cop was wrong in this.	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	1	I do agree that the officer is incorrect here. I can't even figure out why they were detaining her in the first place. Did you see that part? Was it an expired or already served warrant?	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	10	the kids will never forget that image as long as theyre alive	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	11	I am sure of that. I guess since this study seems to be about empathy, what do we feel from the officer's perspective?	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	12	Thats a tough one...what do you feel?	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	13	I mean, I understand it is a high stress job. So let's assume there was a clerical error and he sincerely believed there was a warrant for her. If she is denying that, then maybe he did feel she was resisting. I mean, I have trouble with the idea of punching her in the face, but we don't know what the warrant may have been.	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	14	I know most cops are good definitely. It's just when these things happen it buries all the good and brings all the bad to the forefront.	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	15	"I am very much in favor of monitoring the police and I think the same is said for ""my"" side of this - there is a lot of good in the people who want to police to be carefully monitored, but there are a few bad apples that ruin it - like the people who killed the cops in Texas."	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	16	we need to find a way to monitor them as they have guns and the majority of citizens do not.	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	17	I agree, and I think you said before that they need better training?	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	18	yes thats what I think, do you?	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	19	I always thought that was the case, but one friend of mine said cops are trained to kill witht heir guns, not to incapacitate - on purpose. This guy was a cop too, so I don't know. Maybe it isn't more training, but better training?	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	2	She was saying the issue was resolved, so by that I guess she called for help but no longer needed it? Not sure!	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	20	Yes quality over quantity	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	21	I think so. That is ten turns, by the way.	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	22	was a good chat. bye	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	23	You too, bye	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	3	Regardless, I have a friend who was arrested and the only charge was resisting arrest. How does that even work? How can your only charge be resisting arrest? What arrest were you resisting if there are no other charges?	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	4	Yeah its weird how the law works for some and not for others. If she tells you the issue is resolved one would think that's the cue to move on to the next call.	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	5	Absolutely. It seems like they are wasting time. And then they punch her!	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	6	Seems to me like cops are undertrained. Anybody can be a cop and it shouldn't be that way.	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	7	I had to track down the video, by the way. There is no dispute that she was legitimately punched in the face. It isn't like a maybe she was punched: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cop-punches-woman-video_n_582ddbd0e4b030997bbdd8c3	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
459	8	wow thats crazy to watch	1	371.0	71.0	458.0
459	9	And what makes me most upset is that her kids saw it. I really feel bad for the kids. Look, maybe mom isn't the best if she had a warrant at one point, but those poor kids seeing her get punched in the face.	2	371.0	76.0	958.0
462	0	Did you have a particularly strong emotional reaction to this article?	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	1	It made me feel concerned.	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	10	It's just the new imperialism. Instead of actively occupying a region with strategic value, just install a government that will play ball and silently control policy within the country from abroad.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	11	That sounds very unfair for the people living in that country... Sad that this still goes on and there is no real end in sight.	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	12	Quite. But, the fact is these countries couldn't properly function without aid from more developed nations. Governments use that as leverage and the populaces interests fall by the wayside.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	13	How do you know so much about all this? It's interesting to learn all this, as my knowledge is lacking in that area, as Im sure you can tell	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	14	I really don't know very much at all, but I do try to keep up with international politics. It's something I never could have pictured myself doing even five years ago because it can be very depressing, but here we are. Plus, I like history and learning about other cultures.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	15	Good for you! We could all stand to be more aware of what is going on in the world. It's so easy to avoid, because it is sad.	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	16	It's also very telling about the core concepts of human nature. It's a shame that we've essentially been solving disputes the same way since the beginning of recorded history.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	17	It is... It's crazy with how far we have come as a human race, we have more or less stayed the same in a lot of ways.	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	18	Yep, well thanks for chatting today. Hope you have a pleasant afternoon! bye	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	19	vye	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	2	How so?	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	20	bye	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	21	sorry, bye	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	3	Becuase it seems like this is going to be another very long, deathly war that we are fighting for who knows what reason	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	4	Which war in particular? I read this as an isolated incident concerning an ally and miscommunication.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	5	The war that is starting in Syria... America is starting to send troops over there. How did this article make you feel	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	6	The Syrian civil war has been going on for eight years and America has been at least tacitly involved since the get go. Anyway, I think that this was just Jordanian soldiers being a little jumpy because of the recent terrorist attack and American soldiers not following protocol.	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	7	You sound knowledgeable on this subject. That makes sense though... Do you think there is any resolution in the near future for this war?	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
462	8	It's a war of attrition that has many foreign interests in play. The fact that it boils down to having a secular government or a Muslim government makes it even more volatile. Since there have been hundreds of thousands of refugees and more than half of the internal population displaced, I think the question is: What will be left to claim if it ever does end?	1	18.0	74.0	461.0
462	9	That is a gruesome statement.... hard to think about. But it makes sens	2	18.0	68.0	961.0
471	0	what did you think about this article	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	1	I thought it was very sad what happened to the victims. You	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	10	That does sound convenient. Do you drive a lot on your own then?	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	11	Yes i do, i use both ways of transportation. But about the story, i feel so bad for the families of the victims	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	12	Me too... That's another reason I hope they can find out the cause, is to give the families some sort of closure or reasoning. It would suck not knowing.	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	13	Yeah definitely. Let's hope they have a decent future moving forward	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	14	I hope so too... I also feel bad for the people that witnessed the incident. That had to have been tramautizign	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	15	Yeah! I would have gone into depression if i saw something like that..	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	16	"Me too... and the people injured, that would be evne worse. Probably left thinking ""what if"""	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	17	I wonder what the world would be like without trains	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	18	Probably a lot less developed	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	19	I can see that. Well it was nice talking to you! bye	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	2	Same here.... I hope they can find out what caused it	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	20	you too! bye	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	3	Yeah, i ride trains all the time so this is scary	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	4	I've actually never ridden one so I can't relate. But I'm sure it would make me more nervous if I was...	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	5	Wow! That's very interesting. Whats the reason for never riding on a train?	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	6	I just live in a small town, we can drive everywhere so we do. I dont think there even is any sort of like passenger trains, just stock ones	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	7	Wow thats very cool. Have you ever flown?	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
471	8	Yah I flew to Europe once! So do you ride trains for like commuting? Or travel?	1	297.0	68.0	470.0
471	9	Trains are very convenient. There's almost a stop everywhere	2	297.0	70.0	970.0
478	0	The amount of food that the US wastes is beyond comprehension.   Your thoughts?	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	1	I agree! It's insane... But I definitly do it myself and it's something I need to work on	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	10	I go more often instead of a larger purchase.  I have found you do not throw away so much food.   I also do not believe all the expiration dates, use by this date, etc.   I have eaten it if it has never been open.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	11	That's not a bad idea... I usually don't follow the use by dates either, I've read they can be scammy, just to get you to buy more	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	12	Exactly!   Same thing with medicine.   I have even asked the doctor about expiration dates and he said no such thing.   Big Pharma doing the same thing you noted.   I just want to do something to adjust everyone's thinking but few get on board	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	13	Me too! Think how much we could save as a whole! Money and resources	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	14	We could do so much just here in US.   I work with a great deal of at-risk children and refugee families that have been located here.    All of those folks stay hungry.   Public assistance isn't enough and the refugee families have extremely large families.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	15	That is so sad... With how much food we have, nobody should be going hungry.	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	16	It is sad.   The % of American children that go to bed hungry every night makes me sad.  Yet it's never discussed	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	17	It's awful... And there's no reason for it. Why can't we donate just a bit of money? Rice and beans, oatmeal. It's all nourishing and cheap	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	18	yes it is and ramen.   A few stores here do it only at Thanksgiving or Christmas.   Why is it limited to those?	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	19	Right? People need to need every other day of the year too.	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	2	"Everyone does.   I believe a ""portion"" of the problem is there is no where to take it in most communities."	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	20	And the hunger in the rest of the world is astounding.    Occasionally you will get the sad TV commercial of malnourished kids in Africa, etc. but I don't give to those.   Most of it is given to huge executive salaries (mad face)	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	21	I've heard that too... LIke these company's CEOs are millionaires or billionaires	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	22	Agreed.   Mark Cuban takes a big piece of Goodwill sales as if he needs more money.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	23	Really?? That's awful	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	24	Yes it is - March of Dimes, etc. all the same way.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	25	That's so sad... the rich get richer while the poor continue to suffer and strrve	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	26	It has been a pleasure indeed talking with you.    Have a blessed day.   goodbye	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	27	you as well! bye	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	3	That is a good point... If I knew where to take food that I knew I wasn't going to use, I definitly would.	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	4	Exactly!   I have had parties in the past where there are trays and trays of great food that could be taken somewhere.   There isn	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	5	Do food banks accept food like that? I'm not sure	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	6	I apologize for hitting send too quickly.  :)  They do not here in Colorado.   They will take unopened boxes or cans and that's about it.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	7	No worries :) Interesting... But i guess that kind of makes sense. I'm sure it's the same here in Idaho	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
478	8	I just think about all the homeless shelters as well as those that are on the street.   Every community knows where they are so a drop off place should be available.	1	53.0	65.0	477.0
478	9	Yes, convenience is key in getting people to help out. Those numbers definitly make me think twice about what I'm buying when grocery shopping.	2	53.0	68.0	977.0
484	0	hey what did you think about the article	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	1	i thought it lacked info... but it was sad	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	10	Me two! i can barely afford it	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	11	did you know we spend $80 a day on each prisoner	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	12	Really that makes me so angry!	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	13	yah! More than some people make in  a dya	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	14	how is that possible !	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	15	minimum wage/part time	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	16	Yeah true I just got fulltime i had no idea	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	17	I know.. it's sad. I used to make less than that! The world is so backwards sometimes	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	18	I agree, have to go great chatting bye	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	19	bye	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	2	I agree I wish I knew more of motivation	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	3	and how many people were hurt	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	4	True it is such an odd occurance	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	5	Yah... I'm honestly kind of glad he killed himself	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	6	Yeah we don't need that kind of person running around society	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	7	agreed... and that way money/time isn't wasted on him	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
484	8	true alot of tax dollars go to horrible people in prison	1	292.0	96.0	483.0
484	9	right? They have better healthcare than I do	2	292.0	68.0	983.0
494	0	What did you think about thsi read	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	1	I think it is so scary	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	10	haha it is wierd to think about	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	11	glad i get bottled water	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	12	Yes me too	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	13	one day it will be fixed	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	14	hopefully! And hopefully soon for the poor people living there	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	15	yeah horrible quality of life	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	16	yah.... i hope people can get out of there	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	17	They need fema or something	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	18	that's true	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	19	it has been great chatting! bye	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	2	it totally is! Crazy that it is happening in such a develped country	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	20	bye	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	3	I agree it is scary how much is hidden from us	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	4	Right? and why is this even an issue... Clean drinking water isn't a luxury. IT should have been solved asap	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	5	I agree especially after flint !	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	6	Right?? and it's sad nobody has really covered it this is the first im hearing of it	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	7	I know isnt that scary just poison in our waters no coverage of it	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
494	8	right? what if the water we are drinking right now is poisonous	1	218.0	68.0	493.0
494	9	im am so freaked out!	2	218.0	96.0	993.0
497	0	So what do you think. Accident or foul play?	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	1	I'm not sure really... My gut says accident	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	10	Very strange, honestly.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	11	Maybe he was passed out when they did it? from drinking?	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	12	Or it didn't happen in the room and he was deposited there after.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	13	That's a good persepective... Maybe they took him somewhere for questioning	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	14	Or he knew too much about something, yeah.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	15	Could be yah...Poor guy, what a sad thing to die over.	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	16	Yeah, I guess that's the case no matter how it happened. He wasn't even 60, iirc. :(	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	17	yah I don't think he was either :(	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	18	I wonder if he had any family. :(	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	19	Probably at that age... or even if he didn't have his own, his mom and stuff probably were still alive... It's sad that people will kill over that, if that is what happened.	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	2	Haha, mine was the opposite, but maybe I'm just jade.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	20	Yeah. Do you have any further thoughts on the article?	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	21	I don't	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	22	Okay. It was good talking to you then. bye!	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	23	you too! bye	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	3	I just can see  a drunk person doing something dumb alone in a hotel room to get himself hurt/killed. I dont think I had enough info tho to know for sure haha	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	4	True. I just hear ex-aide to Putin and immediately assume something's up.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	5	Ohhh I didn't catch that part.. That does make me more suspicious of foul play then	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	6	Ah, gotcha. Yeah no, this was one of Putin's aides and he apparently did a lot of propoganda work for them.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	7	I can see foul play then.. And the people involved in that would have the know how to keep it clean and under wraps	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
497	8	Yeah. I mean, it said he had blows to the head, neck, torso, etc. that resulted in death -- and he just died alone in his hotel room without calling for help? Seems weird.	1	103.0	67.0	496.0
497	9	You think somebody would have heard something with all that going on	2	103.0	68.0	996.0
178	0	Do you think the campaign to end the guardianship system in Saudi Arabia will be successful?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	1	I hope it will. I think it is really messed up how women are treated over ther ein that culture. No one should be treated as property. Plus theya re their own person; why do they need the permission of a man do so like literally anything?	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	10	Well the short version is this: the first king of Saudi Arabia united the peninsula by warring with some tribes and allying with others. Classic Game of Thrones stuff. However in order to win his campaign he decided to ally himself with the Wahhabis. They were known for being particular good soldiers, but there was one catch: they are extremely orthodox and they made him promise that the new kingdom would follow their religious ideology. The new king began trading oil with the west and opened Saudi Arabia to westerners culturally and economically. The Wahhabis did not like this and they have been expressing their frustration about it in many ways for years, sometimes violently.	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	11	Oh wow. I did not know any of that. That explains why their ways over there seem like they are set in stone; because the pretty much kinda are.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	12	Yes, the king made a promise he could not keep and the rest is history. Western culture has been slowly becoming more popular through trade, media, and now the internet. The traditionalist have been getting angrier and angrier about it over the years and I am concerned that this new movement will enflame these tensions. If that happens I don't think the west will be insulated from it.	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	13	You know that kinda reminds me about all the church groups here that really hare lgbt and leftist pollitical ideals here in the south. So in that regard the traditionalists there and here aren't that different.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	14	Yeah they might read different books but they are pretty much the same, but the traditionalist in Saudi Arabia have a lot more money and sometimes fund extremism.	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	15	 I don't think extremism is ever good but that's just me. I hate violence. I don't think it is right to hurt people over beliefs. I'm sure there are groups here though that also fund violence. How does the KKK get all of it's funding? Someone's gotta be donating to them right?	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	2	I don't think we should criticize their culture after viewing it through a lens of our own. I also don't believe women are treated more in a cherubic sensed as property. I would say they are regarding more	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	3	You make a valid point that is pretty unfair of me to apply my values onto them in that way.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	4	What do you think about the women who support guardianship? What is your impression of them?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	5	I'm not sure. Like i guess they are used to the set ways over there, or they just aren't bothered by it. I mean at the end of the day it is their choice to go along with it or oppose it, and since they are okay with it I guess it would be wrong of me to judge them for that since they are the primary party effected by the rule.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	6	I agree that is their choice. I sincerely hope some compromise can be reached because it does appear that there are some women who are dissatisfied. I worry about how this movement will affect relations between Saudis and westerners	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	7	Yea. Like my first impression was bad for sure because I immediately looked at things from like, our culture's point of view. I didn't think about it from their perspective. Which makes me kinda look like an ***hole. I hope things work out ok though for both parties of women over there though. Pollitical reform is always a hard road to travel. I hope that some positive progress is made.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	8	Do you know much about Saudi Arabia's history?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	9	Personally no, all I know is that there is a lot of conflict in that area and there has been for a while. Please enlighten me if you can; I am always open to learning new things	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
26	16	Hmm. Not sure what we could do in that regard. I don't think they'll listen to the UN. Ugh it's just a complicated situation.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	17	Yes, and after having this conversation definitely something I need to get more information on. I don't know about you but i've only about ten minutes left on my HIT timer, so why don't we wrap this up relatively quickly?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	18	Same here.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	19	So, do you hail from the states?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	20	Indeed I do. Right in the bible belt.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	21	Ha! Me too.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	22	Yea. Thats why when you mentioned Westboro I immediately was like. Ew.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	23	I've just seen them mentioned in mainstream media on occasion. Do you usually keep up with new?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	24	Yea most of the time. People around here hate that group. They picketed at a marines funeral here once.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	25	I actually heard about that. Totally shameful. Do you have family in the military?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	26	Yes I do.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	27	My younger brother is currently serving in the army.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	28	My Uncle is in the Marines haha. Anyway, It's been a lovely conversation with you random turker. Have a great rest of the work day c:	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	29	Back at you!	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	30	bye	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	31	bye	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
84	22	Man cops get too much flak. Yes some of them are corrupt and some are trigger happy, but the majority are legit there to do their job.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	23	Cops are more good than bad	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	24	Yea. Around my area they are really good. I think only one in the past 6ish years has been thrown off the force for doing something dumb.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	25	they give out toys to kids at the local parks around LA all the time	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	26	They do that here too around christmas. Although I have a feeling they are underfunded as well. They still drive beat up partol cars from the 90's	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	27	yeah all that money is spent on the military probably which is not even that needed	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	28	Amen to that. But of course we gotta be the world police right? Ugh.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	29	world police that never does a succesful intervention which makes it worse	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	30	Yea it's all just a waste of lives, money, resources, etc.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	31	aren't we still in Afghanistan? lol	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	32	We are in Afganistan, Iraq, Iran (unofficially, but I know people based there,) basically like every country in the middle east at this point.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	33	don't forget we have bases in Germany, Japan, etc for no reason. If Russia did that we'd be calling them evil.	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	34	Oh man yea truth for sure. I bet that new space force is gonna get proper funding though amirite? Man we are in such a pit as a country right now.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	35	yeah its quite depressing to see some people without health care and then see new fighter jets being built	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	36	Yea I know how that feels personally. It's bull. Our monetary allocation is all over the place.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	37	1st world country btw	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	38	Yea totally. Hell my mom can't even afford her medication to function every day. It is ridiculous.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	39	yeah its not very fair how they allocate everything	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	40	Maybe one day things will get better. One can hope.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	41	One can only pray	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	42	Anyway rantom Turker it's been a great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday! :) goodbye	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	43	bye	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
23	0	Hey there, this article is pretty morbid. It really hits home for me though since I've dealt with this subject before.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	1	Yeah, I thought it was very troubling because of the number of times she went for help, and she was always just turned away, essentially.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	10	Honestly, the first step is that people just need to take these things seriously. And insurance companies need to start covering treatments. It took me forever to find a decent psych. And of course insurance doesn't cover it. It's messed up. It all comes down to money these days I think.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	11	Yeah, I think it would take a generational change, like starting with education in schools about mental health care and that it's just like any other illness that needs to be respected and understood.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	12	For sure. Through my experience I find that it is older people that are the most..uh.. skeptical when it comes to topics/illnesses like these.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	13	"Yeah, they were raised with a ""suck it up"" attitude and people with more severe mental illness were hidden away or sent away. I don't know how much can be done about people like them, would be best to focus efforts on the young and then try to change society from the bottom."	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	14	"Oh man the amount of times I heard ""suck it up"" or "" you have no reason to be depressed."" That messed me up bad."	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	15	I'm sorry that happened to you. It's so ignorant. We definitely need education campaigns and PSAs to try and educate people.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	16	"For sure. It's kinda messed up when your own family is ignorant to your blatantly obvious issues. Which ties back into that article. I can't even inagine what it feels like for a doctor to just tell you to get over it. That's like going to the police to report a major crime and they just say ""deal with it yourself."""	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	2	Yea suicide is no joke. It took me a couple of years before I received the help I needed and still it was a struggle. I feel so bad that this poor woman didn't get help. It's really messed up.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	3	That's really sad to hear that it took that long. I'm not surprised at all, but it's ridiculous that mental health issues aren't treated as seriously as other medical issues since they can be just as fatal.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	4	Exactly. Plus it really really hurts when people like, look at you as less of a person for having these issues.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	5	"Yeah, there is definitely an incredible stigma around it, treated as a weakness rather than a health issue. Can see that in this article too, a constant attitude of ""you're all right, go home."" Until the worst happens, then they act surprised."	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	6	I always hated it when people told me that. Especially family members. Never had a doctor say that though. Must've been so so rough for this woman.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	7	Yeah, if you can't get help from doctors, who can you get help from? I definitely have heard stories like this before though, since mental health care is so overstressed and understaffed, people who aren't considered 'in immediate danger' just get sent home.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	8	It's a shame and just messed up. I can't imagine the extent of the dread she felt. Like I've been there, but for so many repeated attempts to get help, just to be turned away.. that'll mess you up so much more.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	9	Right, because I imagine she felt hopeless or unimportant. I guess the question is how things can be improved in the mental health care system?	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
84	0	Hey there, I think it's pretty messed up that those people died from a result of the chopper being borked.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	1	Yeah and the fact that the helicopter had a power failure when trying to get to them is disappointing.	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	10	Real talk. Those people go at their job hardcore. Although seeing as Cali has wildfires literally every year they are probably better funded as well.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	11	Search and Rescue just aint that known like firefighters are	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	12	True. Their role is equally as important though. Too many ill prepared people do risky things and end up in trouble.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	13	I remember hearing Trump wanted to cut federal aid to Cali which is probably why the rescue team is so bad.	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	14	Wait really? What the hell? That's kinda messed up. Even if they oppose him pollitically like, their people too dude.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	15	Yeah, politics is crazy	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	16	Yea for sure.. I guess he's gotta funnel all that money into the wall though right?	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	17	Who knows what he'll do he's out of it. I think we did 15 turns though lol.	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	18	It's gotta be 10 each.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	19	All in all, search and rescue teams need to have a huge upgrade	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	2	You would think that they would have some sort of backup plan or maybe a spare chopper though.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	20	Yea for sure. Any service does when people's lives are on the line.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	21	Yeah they are equally as important as everyday cops.	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	3	Yeah doesn't really make me feel like they can be relied on	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	4	I wonder if they are underequipped to handle situations. Maybe they don't get enough funding.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	5	Maybe they dont have the funding youre right	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	6	I mean if so that is pretty messed up; especially in Cali. People get hurt hiking and rock climbing all the time there so you'd think they'd beef up the rescue response.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	7	They definitely need to be more prepared	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
84	8	If I recall the response to the recent wildfire was kinda eh as well. Search and Rescue wise I mean. The firefighters worked their butts off.	1	353.0	63.0	83.0
84	9	They can learn a thing or two from firefighters	2	353.0	71.0	583.0
328	16	Yes indeed. It's very difficult, I think. Science makes it harder and easier. It's a double edged sword.	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	17	Same thing with computers.   Old days it was simple.  Now you have to do 4x the work to enter what the computers say.    I did find it interesting that both Rackover and Dilione had their heads hung very low when they were charged.   Body language says a lot.  I would love to see expressions and listen to their statements to see if you can detect a lie.	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	18	Yes, we speak so much without words. DO you have any final ideas?	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	19	None.   I know we have to do at least 10 turns and we can earn more.  What's your interest?	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	20	"I can do a few more rounds. What do you think the impact would be of a ""partying"" lifestyle for the jury?"	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	21	I think it sways the jurors to a guilty verdict.   Sex and partying got out of hand so IT has to be him........  I do not buy the sex piece.   They knew each other too long for that.	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	22	"You see these studies about rape cases and women ""deserving"" it. I was thinking more about the sympathy for the victim? Does it lessen that sentiment?"	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	23	No one deserves rape.   It's the only criminal offense that I can think of that always blames the victim because of previous six life, provocative clothing, etc.   It has nothing to do with the crime.   Victim is used a great deal in court - both sides play it.	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	24	I agree with that, of course, but if there wasn't some general sentiment about it, there wouldn't be so many studies. I would hope something like that wouldn't sway anyone.	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	25	I am a firm believer you have to pass a test to be a juror.   This article made me think a great deal about what Comunal was feeling when his surrogate son was stabbing him.	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	26	Comunale was the friend who died, but the surrogate father was Jeffry Rackover - a jeweler for celebrities like Melania Trump.	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	27	That's right!	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	28	I am shocked that you meet someone at a gym and then go to lunch and then just let them take your last name. The kid was an expert grifter for sure.	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	29	He obviously had no morals or remorse about anything.	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	30	And back to evidence - how can that attitude about life that is so clear and evident - be used in court these days? It seems so hard to trust anyone.	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
328	31	You are exactly right.  It's not easy anymore.   It's been very nice chatting with you.  I did the other Empathic Conversation a couple of days ago.  Whoever it was had not read it, so it was hard completing it.   Enjoy MTurking!   Don't forget to include the word goodbye when you receive this!  Goodbye!	2	89.0	65.0	827.0
328	32	bye	1	89.0	76.0	327.0
23	17	Yeah I feel like that whole system needs a massive overhaul. Like that's their government system so they need to be extra accountable over there.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	18	Yea and you'd think that they would be. But of course healthcare takes a backseat to like idk.. butter knife licenses or something pointless. On a side note though.. drowning in the ocean must be one of the worst ways to go. Like thats prolonged panic and suffering before lights out. Legit sounds absolutely horrible.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	19	Yeah, she took one of the worst ways out. She must have been desperate.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	20	For sure. You have to be really desperate to put yourself through that. I'm glad I never hit that point; I'd rather it be quick if it was gonna happen. But lord, that woman's death was so needless. It did not need to happen and the fact that help was refused is so disgusting. I wonder if those doctors even felt remorse about it.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	21	I feel like it probably happens a lot so they might be numb to it.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	22	Ah yea they probably deal with death all the time. Didn't think about that.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	23	It's something that needs to be investigated by people above them though, like by politicians etc, they need new directives to properly handle things.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	24	For real. But will they actually do anything is the real question. I'm not sure if half of them take mental issues seriously either.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	25	I wonder if in that particular case, in the UK, if it will help that it was someone involved with the news media. Like it might make the media pay more attention to it and they'll get more pressure because of that.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	26	That is a good point. Sometimes it does take a tragedy from someone famous to get the ball rolling. Kinda sad that it does take that though to be honest.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	27	Yep, I feel like that's typical though, and we just need to work with it.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	28	As with most things in our lives I suppose.	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	29	Yeah. If the media puts pressure, that might actually cause some change, even if it's sad that that is what it takes. It's better than nothing. Could be the start of a good education campaign.	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	30	And honestly that is what we need. Just some good education to get people to realize that this stuff is serious. Well anyway, it's been a lovely chat with you Random Turker. Here's hoping the rest of the work day goes smoothly :)	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	31	For sure. Have a good rest of your day. :)	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
23	32	bye	1	281.0	63.0	22.0
23	33	goodbye	2	281.0	89.0	522.0
178	16	Maybe you are right. I hope that the Saudis can find some compromise, but if our culture is causing tensions between them maybe we should just back off. I would like whatever outcome allows us both to coexist peacefully. What do you think?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	17	Of course. Coexistance is what we need. We don't need to try to constantly police everything over there for sure.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	18	Yea I agree. Do you think guardianship will ever change or be abolished?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	19	I mean anything is possible. It just might take some time. Hopefully no violence comes out of it though.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	20	It seems like the opposition to it has been peaceful so far. Let's see how long that lasts. I found it interesting that the article mentioned there were women who support guardianship. I was hoping to hear more about them and why the support it	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	21	Yea it would be interesting to hear more from their side about it. It's always nice to gain an understanding of both sides.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	22	Why do you think some Saudi women might be in favor of guardianship?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	23	"Maybe they don't want to ""rock the boat."" Or maybe they are just used to the system the way it is and don't mind it. I wish we could ask them."	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	24	Good points. I was also curious what some of the Saudi men had to say about the issue but the article did not mention it	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	25	Yea it would be intersting to know now many men are willing to end the system.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	26	What do you think they might say about it?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	27	I'm not sure. On the one half, you have the men who want to keep everything the same, and on the other there may be some who think that the women deserve a little more freedom on what they do. I'm sure there's plenty of arguing on both sides. Just like there is here about lgbt issues.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	28	Yes I am sure there is much debate. The article mentioned they were also discussing changing some aspects of guardianship. What changes do you think could be made that would ameliorate the concerns of some Saudi women?	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	29	Hmm. Not entirely sure. Maybe they could reduce the senarios where they would need permission from a man to do things? Like working or studying.	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
178	30	That might be a good place to start. This has been a great conversation. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye	1	283.0	79.0	177.0
178	31	Likewise! have a great rest of the workday random turker! bye!	2	283.0	63.0	677.0
72	0	Isn't this heartbreaking? It makes me never want to go on another ride at an amusement park.	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	1	Yeah...Whenever I'm on a huge roller coaster or something, I always have the thought that I just could fly out and die. And I guess that's where some of the excitement comes from. For these lives to be ruined on that ride though, it's terrible.	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	10	True. We have our local fair going on right now and I took my daughter on the giant slide and going up the stairs that thing was so rickety I really don't think it was put together right. lol	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	11	You probably feel worse after reading this story lol. And the problem with these small fairs is they probably can't afford the safety checks and engineers to properly maintain the ride.	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	12	No they probably can't which is too bad because they're such a fun thing to do once a year that doesn't require traveling far	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	13	Yeah and the food is usually incredible too. I love fairs!! Do you think the park will be liable for this accident? Or maybe you waive your rights when you purchase tickets?	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	14	I bet they are liable. I don't think that you would waive your rights unless you explicitly sign a waiver. But who knows maybe they make everyone sign a waiver.	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	15	If they are liable, they're in trouble. I'm not sure how much money it would require to replace having a mother for your life. And that's just the one person, I think four people died in this situation.	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	16	Yeah 4 and I'm sure they will all sue for whatever they can. I think they can not only sue the park but probably whoever the person is that allowed the ride to continue to stay open after failing the safety checks	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	2	It is terrible. It doesn't even sound like its a thrill ride. It sounds like its just one of those water rides that you kinda float along and get wet but no massive drops or turns. I wouldn't have thought about getting hurt on a ride like that.	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	3	I agree. The boat or whatever they were on capsizing is basically the only way you could get hurt. This story makes me angry too, how could a ride with so many problems pass inspection 3 days earlier?	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	4	I don't know that makes me angry too. Because of someones incompetence people are devastated by the loss of someone close to them.	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	5	Yup. Also that ride was problem plagued pretty much the entire day. If they're having that much trouble with a relatively simple ride, how about you shut it down for the day??	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	6	No kidding. Its not like there wasn't other rides to go on. just shut it down. Since its in Australia I wonder if they have to follow the same guidelines the theme parks here in the US have to follow? I'm pretty sure there's restrictions and guidelines. Or maybe thats just wishful thinking. lol	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	7	I think 3rd world countries are the only ones with less restrictions than America lol. At least they shut the park down but I think we would do that too.	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
72	8	I don't know lol I'm not really familar with any theme parks other then Disney and I think they're kinda a class unto themselves. lol I'm not one for roller coasters and after reading this I'm not sure I want to go on any water rides now lol	1	3.0	77.0	71.0
72	9	I think that's a little bit of an irrational thought. It happens to everyone though. Just because a plane crashes doesn't mean you should drive 30 hours to your destination instead. Roller coasters are a little bit different but on those water rides, you probably have a .0000000001% chance of dying. And I haven't been to an amusement park in a while. I go to fairs sometimes though and I doubt they have much restrictions regarding ride safety.	2	3.0	81.0	571.0
26	0	Hey there! So this article is something. I can't help but wonder why people of different religious backgrounds can't seem to get along in that part of the world. We seem to do ok over here in the West.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	1	Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	10	Don't forget the oil as well. We gotta chug that sweet sweet crude at the expense of our own soldiers lives, and the natives lives. It's a vicious cycle of greed, and power	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	11	Right, it's a crying shame. I have a very difficult time attempting to put myself in the shoes of the people who are affected by these types of problems. I mean, waking up in the middle of the night to your family being slaughtered or sold into slavery and being told to just deal with it?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	12	And the trauma of war in general as well. Always living in fear of weather or not you are going to get bombed, shot, raped, etc. I'm sure that there is an immense amount of suffering in that region.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	13	It's insane. The question is, what can we in the west even do to help? Is there anything at all?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	14	Well the only thing we can do is use military, but that in and of itself is a bad thing because then they hate us even more.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	15	I think that it would depend on the approach. I've heard there has been some success in the US forces training a standing army in Afghanistan, but not much. I was thinking more about humanitarian efforts.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	2	Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	3	I agree and am on the same page when it comes to religiosity. It seems like these militant groups in the Middle East are sincerely devoted to unmaking thousands of years of human progress.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	4	Yea. I don't understand it personally. I guess their religion demands them to kill? Or maybe people in power have just twisted it into that meaning. It's just a shame though that people are being persecuted for their beliefs. What does it matter if someone else worships a different being than you? How does that effect you?	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	5	From what I understand about these groups is that they have decided to pervert their sacred texts in their interpretation so that they are in fact called to violence. An analog would be the Westboro Baptist church here in the states. If someone is not following the same religious tenets as you it makes them much more difficult to control; you aren't playing by the same rules.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	6	Of course it comes down to control. I hate that people ar elike that to eachother tho. But of course I suppose it is in our nature to try to be dominant over eachother. Also as for Westboro, those people disgust me. Absolute degenerates full of hatred.	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	7	Hatred can be a very powerful force. Unfortunately, it seems that our world is filled with more of it every day; or at least those who are full of hatred have the loudest voices. I'd like to think that these militants truly believe that they are saving peoples souls, but the fact that they would allow them to stay as long as they paid a tax kind of robs the whole process of any mystique. This whole thing is about power. I agree about any self righteous group too. Can't you find something that is actually productive to do with your time?	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
26	8	I just hate that so many people need to suffer. It isn't right, no matter the reason, to persecute and murder people. And using religious views as a cover isn't an excuse. It also doesn't help that entire part of the world is so volitile in general. Hasn't there been conflict there for literal centuries?	1	171.0	63.0	25.0
26	9	Exactly, and that conflict prevents them from making any marked social or political progress at the lower levels of society. The rich get richer and the poor are left to fight each other over the scraps that remain. Plus, in a lot of ways America specifically has been spurning on this conflict for it's own vested interest in arms sales.	2	171.0	74.0	525.0
