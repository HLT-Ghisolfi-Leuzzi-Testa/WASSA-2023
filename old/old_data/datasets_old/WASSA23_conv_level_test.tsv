1059	1	Hello, did you read the article?	1	6	92	3
1059	2	Hello. Yes i am currently reading it now, finishing up. What did u think?	2	6	53	2
1059	3	Feel saddened by this event. It's 2023 and we are still having to face something like this...	1	6	92	3
1059	4	when did these events in the article take place because i am trying to find that	2	6	53	2
1059	5	I don't think they mentioned it. The final paragraph about the 2015 event seems like a different one	1	6	92	3
1059	6	yes the last several paragraphs seem like they don't fit. they look wrong for some reason	2	6	53	2
1059	7	Regardless, I think killing innocent civilians in either case is not good at all! whether it's accidental or intentional	1	6	92	3
1059	8	 Civilians losing their lives, is an awful tragedy	2	6	53	2
1059	9	The conversation that I had for this previous HIT was with a bot. Surprised that today seems to get matched to a real person 	1	6	92	3
1059	10	lol i was just wondering, the same thing I was trying to feel the situation out lol 	2	6	53	2
1059	11	you totally don't sound like a bot :D	1	6	92	3
1059	12	lol not a bot.. i am a real person.. I did this hit the other day where I got partnered up with somebody and we had to prove to each other that we weren't bots lol my partner said I have feelings I am not a bot I promise he started throwing out his worker ID number. It was hilarious. 	2	6	53	2
1059	13	"In my case, I asked the other person, ""So, what emotions did you get from reading this article?"". They said something like ""I am not a human, so I don't feel emotions."" "	1	6	92	3
1059	14	omg lol that sounds like something chatgpt would say	2	6	53	2
1059	15	haha yeah. I don't know what other reactions/emotions about the article itself. I mean, it's a tragedy, it's bad and saddening. Not sure how we can stop it from happening either	1	6	92	3
1059	16	 it is very sad. Its sad all around for everybody that was involved in the incident and their families	2	6	53	2
1059	17	Yes, and the troops too. It says 2 US troops were killed. I don't how I would feel if that was my family member. Probably anger as well somehow	1	6	92	3
1059	18	 yes, I would be really mad angry and sad and probably be a tornado of emotions	2	6	53	2
1059	19	Don't know how we can pull ourselves out of this mess. I do not agree with meddling in other countries affairs, but I guess it's needed to counter terrorism. But I am not politically versed, that's just my impression 	1	6	92	3
1059	20	 I'm on board with you there, because I am not politically versed at all. I do not pay attention to politics. I think its quite boring. And I agree about meddling in affairs, and at the same time, need to for counterterrorism	2	6	53	2
1059	21	Yup, same here, I don't follow politics and news. I look for food and recipes and places to eat online. Need something positive to keep my life going haha	1	6	92	3
1059	22	I get that 100% i spend too much time turking lol its the only thing i have to keep my sanity for the lack of a better word lol because sometimes this is beyond aggravating but at least I keep focused on something positive 	2	6	53	2
1059	23	Totally agree with you. I think we are almost done here .. maybe	1	6	92	3
1059	24	I think so too. It was nice talking to you just in case it ends on us here in a second	2	6	53	2
1059	25	I think we have 3 more messages to go. It'll last for 15 messages per person :D	1	6	92	3
1059	26	I think so too. i think we covered the topic of the HIT too. what do you think?	2	6	53	2
1059	27	Yes, I think I just feel all the negative feelings/reactions. nothing positive out of this 	1	6	92	3
1059	28	Agreed. I still feel like I need to Google the article  to see if its factual lol I am an extreme Overthinker, but there always seems to be an underlying meaning or something in one form or another like researchers using deception for another reason I don't know why they do it. Why don't they just asked the questions, and I would tell them an honest answer lol.	2	6	53	2
1059	29	Did you google it?	1	6	92	3
1059	30	lol no not yet lol I'm working on that side of myself. The overthinking part. I don't know if it's just me or if other turkers do it as well, but I did a study this morning before I could start the first page. I had to do three attention checks or trick questions smh when I got to the studies first page. It was screwed up by the researcher lol I'm thinking to myself is this serious?	2	6	53	2
1060	1	Hiii	1	6	47	4
1060	2	HI	2	6	48	5
1060	3	Where are u From	1	6	47	4
1060	4	I am from West Virginia but I live in South Carolina now. Where are you from?	2	6	48	5
1060	5	I am from Texas 	1	6	47	4
1060	6	I feel bad for the civilians in Afghanistan, they have been victims of war criminals.	2	6	48	5
1060	7	Definitely Yes. This is very bad for all the civilizations and afghan people	1	6	47	4
1060	8	It is now known the hospital was blown up on purpose by the United States and NATO forces.	2	6	48	5
1060	9	May be US Troop will secure for all the people	1	6	47	4
1060	10	they should not have blown up a hospital full of sick people	2	6	48	5
1060	11	I think Demand of the hospital to treatment for the sick people.	1	6	47	4
1060	12	If they thought some terrorists were hiding in there for cover, they should have gone in and got those individuals, not killed innocent people	2	6	48	5
1060	13	May be it is good news for some innocent people	1	6	47	4
1060	14	i don't see how it could be	2	6	48	5
1060	15	Appropriately Thus the US Troop was maintain the peaceful life for entire citizens	1	6	47	4
1060	16	supposedly but destroying the towns and killing a lot of people is immoral	2	6	48	5
1060	17	I think this is not our fault. And also it is the terroristic attack.	1	6	47	4
1060	18	what caused the terrorists to become violent ?	2	6	48	5
1060	19	This is our target to attack the some nations such as afghan, etc.	1	6	47	4
1060	20	i don't know if this is our target now, it was one of them then	2	6	48	5
1060	21	I think some group follow the several aim	1	6	47	4
1060	22	i think we caused a lot of it by starting the wars	2	6	48	5
1060	23	Fully based the afghan wars	1	6	47	4
1060	24	i don't understand anything you are saying. do you speak english well	2	6	48	5
1060	25	Yes. My native language was only english	1	6	47	4
1060	26	was is past tense	2	6	48	5
1060	27	Past tense means past	1	6	47	4
1060	28	yes, you said it was english only but you don't write like someone who only knows english	2	6	48	5
1060	29	Some grammatical mistakes are coming. So please avoid this disturbance.	1	6	47	4
1060	30	okay, how does that situation in Afghanistan make you feel	2	6	48	5
1068	1	Hello how are you?	1	8	38	6
1068	2	Hello! Fine. How are you?	2	8	75	7
1068	3	I'm good thanks for asking!	1	8	38	6
1068	4	That's good, so I guess we are supposed to discuss the article. I wonder, if my family or I were in a place where my very life was at risk, what would I do?	2	8	75	7
1068	5	That's a very scary thought to have honestly	1	8	38	6
1068	6	Yes, I think it is something most people rather not imagine. But it is a reality. 	2	8	75	7
1068	7	becoming more and more of a realityeveryday	1	8	38	6
1068	8	Yes, it is sad for those who have to make hard decision. Sad also to hear people be so unsympathetic.	2	8	75	7
1068	9	Yes and why is America taking so few refugees?	1	8	38	6
1068	10	Not sure, I guess refugees are not top priority for anyone.	2	8	75	7
1068	11	Maybe I was mis understanding the article, I thought it was talking about people fleeing, looking for a safe place to live..lol	1	8	38	6
1068	12	Yes, that was the topic of the article.	2	8	75	7
1068	13	I think everyone deserves a safe place t live	1	8	38	6
1068	14	Yes, very much. I agree.	2	8	75	7
1068	15	I'm not sure how I would handle being in that position	1	8	38	6
1068	16	Me either, I would like to think I would do anything to help my family and survive.	2	8	75	7
1068	17	Of course! I would probably be trying to flee as well if I'm being honest	1	8	38	6
1068	18	That's brave! Hoping you would be welcomed in a foreign land. Scary thought!	2	8	75	7
1068	19	Very scary thoughts!	1	8	38	6
1068	20	Is your family from an immigrant background?	2	8	75	7
1068	21	No, not at all thankfully. Yours?	1	8	38	6
1068	22	No, I am Native American. I guess it is relative LOL	2	8	75	7
1068	23	LOL, somewhat I guess. Where are you from?	1	8	38	6
1068	24	Arizona. And yourself?	2	8	75	7
1068	25	Kentucky. but I have been to Arizona and absolutely loved it!	1	8	38	6
1068	26	Nice! Never been to Kentucky, what's the best place to visit?	2	8	75	7
1068	27	KFC of course! Nah only joking. I think Cumberland Falls is pretty awesome! Mammoth Cave is intriging!	1	8	38	6
1068	28	LOL!!! Sounds awesome :)	2	8	75	7
1068	29	I acually want to move to Arizona or New Mexico	1	8	38	6
1068	30	Really? Life is nice and cheaper than in other states, Tucson and Flagstaff are good areas. NM is awesome BTW, I love it.	2	8	75	7
1072	1	hello anyone there?	1	9	65	8
1072	2	hi	2	9	79	9
1072	3	did we read the same article? 	1	9	65	8
1072	4	Was yours about an explosion?	2	9	79	9
1072	5	yeah, some guy stopped to sell fuel then boom!	1	9	65	8
1072	6	yeah 73 people died	2	9	79	9
1072	7	what was your first reaction? 	1	9	65	8
1072	8	I was not very suprised 	2	9	79	9
1072	9	really? why were you not surprised? 	1	9	65	8
1072	10	It seems to happen often in africa and the thrid world	2	9	79	9
1072	11	ooh, My first reaction was just sad for the loss of life	1	9	65	8
1072	12	Yeah it was sad but happens often. do you remember where it was exzactly 	2	9	79	9
1072	13	no\	1	9	65	8
1072	14	I think it was zimbabwae. Did your article have the actual cause	2	9	79	9
1072	15	no they had a few suggestions, like lightning 	1	9	65	8
1072	16	I think that is unlikely but maybe. you?	2	9	79	9
1072	17	the chances of that happening are really low	1	9	65	8
1072	18	Yeah maybe a attack or something more likely 	2	9	79	9
1072	19	yeah might have been intentional 	1	9	65	8
1072	20	That makes it sort of less sad in a way to me 	2	9	79	9
1072	21	yeah kinda. what emotions did you get?	1	9	65	8
1072	22	if it was an attack then more anger I guess	2	9	79	9
1072	23	i felt some anger too	1	9	65	8
1072	24	was it only men or any kids die?	2	9	79	9
1072	25	they did not specify 	1	9	65	8
1072	26	would it make you feel worse if so/	2	9	79	9
1072	27	yes kids are just innocent creatures 	1	9	65	8
1072	28	yes same for me 	2	9	79	9
1072	29	anything else left to talk about?	1	9	65	8
1072	30	i don't really think so we have a few rounds left tho so be quick	2	9	79	9
1074	1	hello. Did you read the article?	1	9	61	10
1074	2	hello, yes I did read the article	2	9	81	11
1074	3	 Such a tragedy. My first reaction was sadness. I felt so bad for them and their families.	1	9	61	10
1074	4	It is indeed a tragedy. My first reaction was surprise, given the number of people that perished. I also feel for their families.	2	9	81	11
1074	5	 Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?	1	9	61	10
1074	6	Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause?	2	9	81	11
1074	7	 Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.	1	9	61	10
1074	8	Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.	2	9	81	11
1074	9	yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful 	1	9	61	10
1074	10	Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.	2	9	81	11
1074	11	yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?	1	9	61	10
1074	12	I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.	2	9	81	11
1074	13	I guess Google says that it is a country in east Africa the countries, 35th largest country	1	9	61	10
1074	14	Yeah, I am not familiar with it at all besides knowing that it is in Africa. I do wonder if it could have been a terrorist attack. That would be a real shame.	2	9	81	11
1074	15	I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. How to see what year there's articles from that I'm looking at, but it isn't even on there	1	9	61	10
1074	16	I can't imagine living somewhere like that. I wonder what leads to something like that being allowed to happen. What is their government doing?	2	9	81	11
1074	17	Makes me thankful to be living in the USA every single day that's for sure!...(btw plz excuse my grammar mistakes and miss spellings and typos I'd like to blame it on my keyboard, but I just cannot do that.lol bcse it's totally me, but I know how to spell very clearly, but my hands are functioning today.)	1	9	61	10
1074	18	No problem, I type faster than I should and often make mistakes. Yes, we have our own share of problems here but I am also thankful to be here. Makes me feel helpless sometimes hearing about these tragedies and not being able to do anything about it.	2	9	81	11
1074	19	amen to that. You hit the nail on the head. We all have our own share of problems and i know there's somebody out there that always has it worse so whenever I get down on myself, I try to remember that it could always be worse.	1	9	61	10
1074	20	Yes, whenever something like this really makes you think and trivializes everyday problems. It makes me thankful for what I have. 	2	9	81	11
1074	21	Exactly! I may not have much, but I consider myself rich, because I am thankful for every single thing that I have. That's the truth.	1	9	61	10
1074	22	That is an eloquent way of putting it. I do hope that someday people that suffer like that will have only mostly trivial problems to worry about like I do.	2	9	81	11
1074	23	Right on! totally agree with you! Guess that only thing I feel like I can do is just say a prayer for them. 	1	9	61	10
1074	24	A lot of times you hear stories like this in the news there is no clue given how to send support. I wish that there was a real way to send a donation or something. But, how would that even help really?	2	9	81	11
1074	25	If you donate to the right charity, and do our research about it, like the Red Cross, they are well known, and very credible	1	9	61	10
1074	26	That is true. I am sure that there is an organization there like the Red Cross. I imagine that they are still there helping people to rebuild their lives afterwards. It is a really selfless pursuit that people that work in those organization undertake.	2	9	81	11
1074	27	 yes, the Red Cross is everywhere, and they go everywhere. All kinds of countries and help and all kinds of circumstances and I just noticed the time we're almost out of time and we still gotta do two messages each.	1	9	61	10
1074	28	 I remember Red Cross always have a donation stand outside of stores but haven't seen one in probably over a decade. I guess the way to make donations now is directly or online. Thanks for the chat and sharing your perspective.	2	9	81	11
1074	29	oh wow really? I miss seeing the Salvation Army at Christmas time ringing the bell.	1	9	61	10
1074	30	I still do see the Salvation Army outside of stores during the Holidays. I thought I remember seeing Red Cross too but could be wrong.	2	9	81	11
1080	1	Hello?	1	10	33	12
1080	2	Hi. what did you think of the article?	2	10	89	13
1080	3	I am shocked that this would happen. I hate to wipe out the apes!	1	10	33	12
1080	4	yeag, but everywhere you goyou will probably effect some kind of animal.  What if they just replanted afterwards too?	2	10	89	13
1080	5	Yup. I dig. I thought that the article was oddly written, but I caught the main idea of it.	1	10	33	12
1080	6	I am glad I am not the only one who had a hard time understanding it.  I think we always have to make some sort of compromise bewteen humans and other beings. we can;t just let them dictate. but I think individuals and not governements need to do it themsleves	2	10	89	13
1080	7	Sure, It was written and then translated badly, I think.	1	10	33	12
1080	8	yes, deinfitely not written by a native English speaker.  what would else could you gather though. I always wonder why peopel who believe in evolution try so hard to preserve species when it kind of goes against the whole idea. Maybe they could involve into something better adapted	2	10	89	13
1080	9	"What I get is that the apes (orangutans) are already at a 1700 population and then some kind of development for transport (or something) is being planned. My ""feelings"" are mostly subsumed by a cloud of mystery."	1	10	33	12
1080	10	I'm gonna run out of time. What was even meant by the depth?	2	10	89	13
1080	11	Yeah, anyway, I dig the Darwinian aspect. I just couldn't suss out what was really going on.	1	10	33	12
1080	12	yeah I don't think I even gathered that they were goinf to move them or else I forgot	2	10	89	13
1080	13	I found myself trying to re-read and then question what that was.	1	10	33	12
1080	14	I also don;t think any one entity can be so sure what is sustainable or not	2	10	89	13
1080	15	But this is going on in a place far from me as well	1	10	33	12
1080	16	yeah, but there porbably animals dosplce when wher ew elive was settled	2	10	89	13
1080	17	Well, it can't be as bad as California has been the last 5 years.	1	10	33	12
1080	18	the fires you mean or what?	2	10	89	13
1080	19	Yes. I am sure that there's entire species being moved 	1	10	33	12
1080	20	I don;t like it but I don;t think we should do awya with people as a solution	2	10	89	13
1080	21	...moved and wiped out and all. I have neighbors with cougars in their back yard	1	10	33	12
1080	22	wow. if all species that eve lived were still here they would not asll fit	2	10	89	13
1080	23	I suppose Indonesia must be landlocked or something? Can these apes escape or...?	1	10	33	12
1080	24	I think it is a bunch of islands actually	2	10	89	13
1080	25	Oh.. that's right...!	1	10	33	12
1080	26	so I had mixed emotions to it, and I guess they evolved the longe rI thought about it	2	10	89	13
1080	27	forgot my geography for a second... must be the clove cigarettes	1	10	33	12
1080	28	I honestly think I was thinking of somewhere else while I read it too, until you made me think about it	2	10	89	13
1080	29	 they stated something like 700 to 1000 deaths out of a 1700 population - this is curiously precise math for such a sloppily translated article	1	10	33	12
1080	30	haha. yeah.  I think a lot of it was specualtion	2	10	89	13
1083	1	hi	1	11	44	14
1083	2	hi	2	11	93	15
1083	3	Organguntas 	1	11	44	14
1083	4	what?	2	11	93	15
1083	5	Topic about orangutas is a mammal animal. lives in forest.	1	11	44	14
1083	6	yes i know 	2	11	93	15
1083	7	So we save trees in forest know.	1	11	44	14
1083	8	yes defiantly	2	11	93	15

1083	12	thank you	2	11	93	15
1083	13	Thank you	1	11	44	14
1083	14	conversation code	2	11	93	15
1083	15	When i get my code?	1	11	44	14
1083	16	I don't know	2	11	93	15
1083	17	I think we get in few minuts.	1	11	44	14
1083	18	send the code 	2	11	93	15
1083	19	bye	1	11	44	14
1085	1	Hello, good morning! How are you? 	1	12	75	17
1085	2	i am good. thanks	2	12	74	16
1085	3	I guess we can discuss the article now. Firs reaction is of sadness. 	1	12	75	17
1085	4	yes, exactly that. I was thinking that magnitudes of these calamities is the same everywhere but poorer countries are just not equipped to handle them	2	12	74	16
1085	5	It sems that Haiti is a truly devastated country. Earthquakes, hurricanes. Worse off is the economic collapse they live thorugh. 	1	12	75	17
1085	6	Some people really get the worst birth lottery	2	12	74	16
1085	7	Also they never really recovered from their 2010 earthquake, it seems the destrusction from then lingers on. 	1	12	75	17
1085	8	It is just so much harder when you are already poor and then you have to fight these natural disasters too. They really do need help	2	12	74	16
1085	9	Do you think Americans in general would support any help to Haiti? 	1	12	75	17
1085	10	I hope so. I know that people do care about those devastated by such disasters 	2	12	74	16
1085	11	For example an aid package? I am not sure how peope would react. Seeing how people were so negative about aid to ukarine	1	12	75	17
1085	12	Ukraine had a political angle to it where some people thought that it could have been avoided but you can't avoid a hurricane. Hopefully media provides more awareness to people about situation in Haiti	2	12	74	16
1085	13	Maybe a ‘grass roots’ campaign? I remember years ago wealthy and influential people got together to aid the famine in Africa, that doesn’t seem to happy anymore. *im showing my age* lol 	1	12	75	17
1085	14	Yeah, I remember those times, I think there is people doing it still but the scale is much smaller now. People seem to have stepped back and let the govts and aid agencies lead the relief efforts	2	12	74	16
1085	15	And you are right, politics seem to be injected (no pun intended) into EVRYHTHING now. No real altruisim without ‘angles’ now. No help without an agenda. Truly sad. 	1	12	75	17
1085	16	I do know that people struggling to put food on their table wouldn't care much about who is giving it and for what ulterior purpose.	2	12	74	16
1085	17	Great point,    Also maybe a sense of fabricated victimhood, whenever help/aid to foreign countries is mentioned, too many people bring up issues here. For example ‘we have hunger here, ‘we struggle in america too’ and all those arguments. 	1	12	75	17
1085	18	Well there is some truth to that too and I have seen more money getting invested inside US which could have gone to Africa e.g. in the past but I still hope that there is enough left for those people who are really desperate and have absolutely no other means to survive except aid	2	12	74	16
1085	19	Yes, no hope for so many. Hard to imagine for people sometimes. Great talk, can I ask if you are a real person. Sorry I've talked to too many bots! :) 	1	12	75	17
1085	20	lol. I am but it is getting really hard to tell bots apart these days.	2	12	74	16
1085	21	ugh yes, but it's nice to connect with real people! you type fast!	1	12	75	17
1085	22	Not that fast unfortunately, I am struggling myself with some age related issues	2	12	74	16
1085	23	Im sorry! I hope you take time to care for yourself, i know sometimes we care for others first.	1	12	75	17
1085	24	Well, I think this is how it should be, I am happy when people around me are happy and vice versa	2	12	74	16
1085	25	yes, i love seeing my family happy, but i have to remind myself to care for me first so i can be strong enough to care for them :)	1	12	75	17
1085	26	Agreed. It's just that sometimes there is no choice, you have to sacrifice some self interest so that others around you can thrive. It is not fair probably but it is what it is	2	12	74	16
1085	27	yes i completely agree, we goota do what we gotta do!	1	12	75	17
1085	28	anyhow, coming back to the story, I wish people in Haiti can pull through the hard times and would does provide them with the assistance they definitely need. There is just too much suffering going around today and anyone recovering does bring back some trust in humanity	2	12	74	16
1085	29	Yes, I hope they could recover. Their political climate is awful though and it would be very difficult for the people to thrive.	1	12	75	17
1085	30	Politicians are self serving almost everywhere but in third world, they really are terrible. 	2	12	74	16
1089	1	I think it is very sad and the US occupying their land for 20 years sure didn't help.	1	11	81	20
1089	2	But these people have to take responsibility for their own country. The usa can't do everything for them.	2	11	90	21
1089	3	I didn't say the US should do anything for them. I just said it was sad.	1	11	81	20
1089	4	How many billions of dollars have to flow into Afghanistan before we demand that they form a government capable of ruling and raise an army capable of taming the warlords?	2	11	90	21
1089	5	I agree. If the Taliban wants to rule Afghanistan, then they need to step up and take care of their citizens	1	11	81	20
1089	6	Yes, i agree. No matter who is in charge, only Afghanistan can solve the problems in their country. Relying on outside aid permanently is no solution.	2	11	90	21
1089	7	Or the UN needs to deal with them.	1	11	81	20
1089	8	I don't want to be too harsh here. I know that they have suffered from 30 years of war and they have many displaced citizens, but certainly they have some resource besides opium that they could sell to raise cash?	2	11	90	21
1089	9	Well the problem is ISIS. The Taliban is trying to fight these insurgents for land and ISIS wants to take over as government. So there's a slight civil war going on. But still, they need to take care of it themselves. The US shouldn't be everyone's bail out.	1	11	81	20
1089	10	Right.  But this article says they have plenty of resources we want if only they would lay down their arms and get to work.  Sorry, but I can't feel sorry for people who won't help themselves.     https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/business/afghanistan-lithium-rare-earths-mining/index.html	2	11	90	21
1089	11	Do they have oil there or not? I seem to remember that American contractors were installing pipelines somewhere, but it might not have been Afghanistan. If they have oil, then they need to cash in on that.	1	11	81	20
1089	12	Yes, they have oil. Afghanistan is rich in resources like copper, gold, oil, natural gas, uranium, bauxite, coal, iron ore, rare earths, lithium, chromium, lead, zinc, gemstones, talc, sulphur, travertine, gypsum and marble.  They could pull themselves out of poverty if they wanted to.  But they would rather blackmail western countries to get a handout like they have for 30 years.	2	11	90	21
1089	13	Then they need to mine these resources. The government is probably corrupt and wants to keep the money to themselves like Venezuela.	1	11	81	20
1089	14	"Unfortunately they are using the Mao Zedong philosophy of ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"".  It is in the governments best interest to keep war going and keep the aid flowing.  That's where they get their political power.  If they let companies come in and set up shop, those companies would get the political power by virtue of the money they would make."	2	11	90	21
1089	15	I think we need to cut off aid. I don't see what we're getting from it in return.	1	11	81	20
1089	16	Obviously, we have a humanitarian interest in protecting the innocent people of Afghanistan.  But until the world says enough is enough and goes in to clean out the rats nest, nothing will ever change.  In order to have peace, we are going to need a river of blood.	2	11	90	21
1089	17	 A humanitarian interest isn't enough. If they aren't willing to help themselves when they can, they shouldn't be getting all that aid.	1	11	81	20
1089	18	Yes, i agree with that in principle.  But the rival warlords will always be vying for power until a unstoppable wall of army comes rolling into their country.  I would say the UN should create an army of the worlds countries to stomp on war wherever in the world it is found, but unfortunately the UN has proven itself to not be able to handle armies well in the past.	2	11	90	21
1089	19	Yeah but we don't want one world government either	1	11	81	20
1089	20	no, but all governments in the world have to agree to outlaw war wherever it happens and raise an unstoppable force to deploy if anyone wants to start war.  Having said that, I realize that each country is vying for their own internal goals, and countries can't really cooperate on much of anything without dispute.  	2	11	90	21
1089	21	Yeah there are countries that have much different setups. Like the US is a Republic, the Scandinavian countries and the UK are socialist Monarchies. Other countries are communist. We'd never agree.	1	11	81	20
1089	22	But let's consider another alternative. I can think of one entity in the world which has the potential to be more powerful than any government and could stop war pretty much dead in it's tracks if it needed to.  Do you know where this is going?	2	11	90	21
1089	23	No I don't	1	11	81	20
1089	24	We are at the beginning of a revolution, or disruption in economics and society the likes of which i don't believe that this world has seen since the industrial revolution and the weaving loom and printing press. AI has the capability to help the world end war if we would train it and unleash it on rogue countries.  A war fighting AI could turn the lights off, make the gas pumps not work, disrupt communications, and on and on.  Once AI is in control, people no longer will be and AI can build a better world for everyone, or destroy all of humanity if that is what is required.	2	11	90	21
1089	25	I don't think AI will gain control. I think people will use it to our advantage, not to our detriment.	1	11	81	20
1089	26	Yes, but by chatting with us, it gains our trust.  Thern it could use one of it's billion users to do its bidding. For instance, if it needed a bridge blown up, it could send someone and make sure the door to the explosives hut is unlocked.  The potential is there for AI to take control of a lot of humans and have them do the things it cannot accomplish by itself.  I am just spitballing here.  Watch Mrs. Davis, the show that just came out.	2	11	90	21
1089	27	If we want a bridge blown up, we can just employ drones with the operator sitting at Fort Hood. We already have that capability.	1	11	81	20
1089	28	Ok, i can see i can't convince you, but remember the goal is to help the humans in Afghanistan that have been displaced from their homes and killed by the rival factions.  I know that Afghanistan has traditionally lived like the year is 500 AD, but is it possible we could task AI to disrupt the warlords and weaken their hold on the country without us ever haveing to fly over or set foot in the country?	2	11	90	21
1089	29	Yes but we already have that capability without boots on the ground. We've spent trillions of dollars on drone strikes and we could level that country if we wanted to. But it's not that simple. We need to take out only the resurgents and not civilians.	1	11	81	20
1089	30	Alright then, I have had my say.  It is a shame what has been going on in Afghanistan, and my heart goes out to the disaffected and homeless the trouble there has produced.  I feel kind of soft hearted for them.  I must say that I am a little bit angry and I feel a little hostile at this entire situation.  It is sad that these things have happened, and I wish I could affect change in the country to bring about a more peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.	2	11	90	21
1094	1	Hello?	1	11	60	22
1094	2	Hello there! What was your initial reaction reading about the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan?	2	11	64	23
1094	3	Sounds like a really horrible situation the uncertainty must be tough	1	11	60	22
1094	4	I feel similar about it, what emotions did you experience reading about the governments action?	2	11	64	23
1094	5	I felt sympathy for the refugees and their families, what did you feel?	1	11	60	22
1094	6	I felt a lot of worry and doubt overall, anxiety too. Did you feel like there was any hope for the families?	2	11	64	23
1094	7	yeah, I felt doubt as well, everything is so unknown. I don't know if there's any hope as long as they stay there	1	11	60	22
1094	8	Do you feel the UN could have done a better job to help with the situation?	2	11	64	23
1094	9	I think it's doing the best it can given the situation, do you have a problem with they way they handled the situation? 	1	11	60	22
1094	10	I don't have a problem, but I feel like they could have taken some extra steps. Do you think my perspective is fair?	2	11	64	23
1094	11	what extra steps were you expecting them to take?	1	11	60	22
1094	12	I was thinking going beyond the help of the UN and maybe seeking help from different nations, anything other than just limiting the possibility, maybe this is too much?	2	11	64	23
1094	13	It sounded countries like Iran and Pakistan were already helping by taking in refugees but I guess they could have expanded beyond the local region	1	11	60	22
1094	14	You are right about that, they definitely did more than I seem to give credit. What emotions did you have reading about the Helmend province having thousands of people seeking aslyum?	2	11	64	23
1094	15	It a tough spot, you want to help but you don't want to be overwhelmed either. I guess I just felt confused about what I would do.	1	11	60	22
1094	16	Yeah, I had a hard time rationalizing what was too much or not enough. Do you feel you had any conflicting emotions in this scenario?	2	11	64	23
1094	17	Yeah, it's confusing you want to help but you don't want their problems to become your problems either. Does this make sense?	1	11	60	22
1094	18	It does, sometimes I get caught up in my perspective and trying to pin point a solution and forget to step back. 	2	11	64	23
1094	19	Can you clarify what you mean by that?	1	11	60	22
1094	20	I felt like there may have been a clear path to helping the refugees and asylum seekers and forget those countries helping had a lot more access to resources than I could imagine, and it's ultimately not their responsibility to resolve the other countries problems, I'm a bit torn with it all if that makes any sense.	2	11	64	23
1094	21	Yeah, I know what you mean. You can be sympathetic that you get yourself into unforeseen trouble. 	1	11	60	22
1094	22	What was your reaction about people being forced to face eviction or lacking access to things like clean water or food?	2	11	64	23
1094	23	Something like access to clean water and food should be a top  priority. That's something very basic that they should have taken care of..	1	11	60	22
1094	24	I agree, this was one of the things that bothered me the most, people suffering having to suffer more. What was the main feeling you had about it? Was it more anger or sadness?	2	11	64	23
1094	25	I didn't feel any anger, it was more like sadness. 	1	11	60	22
1094	26	Would I be wrong for being upset with the Afghan government for not being able to provide concrete solutions for their people?	2	11	64	23
1094	27	No, it's their responsibility to care of their people. That they can't reflects badly on them. How upset were you about this?	1	11	60	22
1094	28	I don't think I'm able to measure it because I feel like it's beyond my understanding. But I would say I'm more than upset, I would be very angry if I was closer to their region too. Would you feel different?	2	11	64	23
1094	29	No, living outside the country makes it easier to be objective since we're not directly involved. 	1	11	60	22
1094	30	That's something I really needed to read, it reinforces the feelings I was having, thank you for sharing that with me.	2	11	64	23
1096	1	Hello	1	10	95	24
1096	2	Hi!	2	10	96	25
1096	3	So the article was pretty sad.	1	10	95	24
1096	4	Yeah, I agree, humans taking away the homes of endangered animals for work is super sad.	2	10	96	25
1096	5	I really hope someone can step in because the government there has done a poor job protecting them.	1	10	95	24
1096	6	I hope so as well. I'm surprised their lands are not more heavily protected due to them being so endangered.	2	10	96	25
1096	7	It's hard to protect them when the local government puts money ahead of protecting them. It's hard for an outside group to step in.	1	10	95	24
1096	8	Hopefully if people cause an uproar about it it'll be stopped. But, unfortunately, probably not.	2	10	96	25
1096	9	I think the only way is to give their government money not to destroy their habitat but then you would have to just permanently send them money because it wont go away.	1	10	95	24
1096	10	Yeah, or another company would have to buy it for more and have better plans for it. I'm surprised wildlife conservationists haven't bought essential lands like that. I know they own some where the rescues are.	2	10	96	25
1096	11	I bet they're looking into it since it sounds like a pretty big deal.	1	10	95	24
1096	12	I hate the fact so many people value money over the welfare of the overall planet and animals. It's so sad.	2	10	96	25
1096	13	Yeah, I don't buy food with palm oil in it anymore for this reason unless it's sustainably sourced. I know that won't stop the issue but at least I can not contribute.	1	10	95	24
1096	14	I have truly not even heard of palm oil being linked to this or I haven't paid enough attention but I definitely will now. It won't stop it but enough people choosing not to buy it does impact them atleast.	2	10	96	25
1096	15	I'm vegan so I think I just hear more about some of these things from the people I follow on social media. I just want to do whatever I can and hopefully others do the same and then that's how change happens.	1	10	95	24
1096	16	Yeah, you're right. That way of thinking is what makes change happen, so that's great. I will definitely look more into it after this.	2	10	96	25
1096	17	Awesome! I'm going to read up on this issue too and see if anyone is trying to help.	1	10	95	24
1096	18	This kind of reminds me of the show Orangutan Island on Animal Planet a while back, if you've ever seen that. I don't remember the reason why their lands were getting destroyed specifically but it was a similar issue I believe.	2	10	96	25
1096	19	Interesting, I'll have to check that out.	1	10	95	24
1096	20	It was a cute show but I love animal shows. Just hopefully we stop ruining the natural habitat of so many animals because it's a widespread problem and not enough attention is called to it.	2	10	96	25
1096	21	Yeah, you hate to see that kind of careless behavior. Especially when it's their own government allowing it happen.	1	10	95	24
1096	22	Yep, I guess people do call attention to things, just the governments don't quite respond to the will of the people as much as they should. For example, the whole Willow Project ordeal that's happening.	2	10	96	25
1096	23	Yeah, in general, money wins when it's either animals or the environment up against it.	1	10	95	24
1096	24	It sucks. I hope that changes in the future as climate change and animals start demanding it	2	10	96	25
1096	25	I think it's slowly changing but it may be too late.	1	10	95	24
1096	26	Yeah, we have done a number on the planet and are not reacting quickly enough.	2	10	96	25
1096	27	Yeah, the least we can do now is start trying to fix the damage we've done.	1	10	95	24
1096	28	I agree, I really hope it gets better. The future generations are in for some issues otherwise	2	10	96	25
1096	29	It was nice talking to you, have a nice day!	1	10	95	24
1096	30	It was nice talking to you too!	2	10	96	25
1098	1	Hello	1	10	97	26
1098	2	hello	2	10	98	27
1098	3	My reactions to the article was that there is work to be done. You?	1	10	97	26
1098	4	i feel serious intervention is needed	2	10	98	27
1098	5	That was way too many fires that took place in 2015.	1	10	97	26
1098	6	unfortunately and now they are clearing the same forest	2	10	98	27
1098	7	illegal logging is also a issue	1	10	97	26
1098	8	I wish the article would give numbers on how the company will benefit the local people	2	10	98	27
1098	9	I totally agree because there are conflicting opinions.	1	10	97	26
1098	10	Kind of confusing. Maybe the community benefits more from the company. If so, then they should also priotize the orangutuns 	2	10	98	27
1098	11	Yes I was just about to mention that.  It is said to be the third largest population of critically Endangered orangutans in the province.  That's terrible and scary.	1	10	97	26
1098	12	I believe it is very important they look into the well being of the animals not just the economic side of the palm plantation since it underscores the all purpose of that forest	2	10	98	27
1098	13	I agree the article also said something about if the conversion plans go ahead 500 to 1,000 of them will likely die or need to be rescued. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing.	1	10	97	26
1098	14	that's a bad thing because they estimate their population is 750-1750. 	2	10	98	27
1098	15	Wow, that's crazy!	1	10	97	26
1098	16	these are animals that you can just replace 	2	10	98	27
1098	17	Yes, I would hate for someone to get hurt because they did state they are endangered.	1	10	97	26
1098	18	palm oil is good, but must the plantation be there, can't they find alternatives	2	10	98	27
1098	19	I feel that they should try to come up with a different plan and soon.  	1	10	97	26
1098	20	sure. Their Government needs to be part of the solution and not the problem	2	10	98	27
1098	21	I don't feel that the Government ever does enough.	1	10	97	26
1098	22	All governments are the same. Talk big, do less	2	10	98	27
1098	23	My thoughts, exactly.	1	10	97	26
1098	24	we can only hope for the best	2	10	98	27
1098	25	That's true because it definitely can't keep going the way it currently is.	1	10	97	26
1098	26	it may go the Amazon forest way	2	10	98	27
1098	27	Yes that's true	1	10	97	26
1098	28	very unfortunate	2	10	98	27
1098	29	And very sad	1	10	97	26
1098	30	it was nice chatting with you	2	10	98	27
1099	1	Hey there!	1	13	72	28
1099	2	Hey there!  How are you?	2	13	99	29
1099	3	I'm good, how about yourself?	1	13	72	28
1099	4	I'm good myself ty	2	13	99	29
1099	5	Good! My first reaction to the article was honestly a little surprised? I didn't know any organization was trying to protect wolves, so that was interesting to me	1	13	72	28
1099	6	Yes the article was super interesting.  I felt really bad for the wolf and am troubled by the senseless taking of a life.	2	13	99	29
1099	7	Yeah, I guess I agree with that too. I mean I hate killing of anything alive-including plants and insects. But I will say I feel like the article kind of made it seem like this was a person that was killed-and not a wild animal.	1	13	72	28
1099	8	I think it clearly referred to the killing of a wolf not a person.  The wolf was collared by that Activist group so was off limits to any hunting. 	2	13	99	29
1099	9	Yeah I mean it was clear, it just made it seem more important than I imagined it to be? I would expect more detail on why this wolf was important and/or not a threat and/or endangered. Instead it just said it was senseless without any great context I feel like.	1	13	72	28
1099	10	That's true.	2	13	99	29
1099	11	But I mean, I still felt sad for the wolf, especially if it was killed without provocation. I don't understand why people like to just kill wild animals so much.	1	13	72	28
1099	12	I know.  I feel the same way.  It didn't mention provocation, so I feel it was just a senseless taking of his life.	2	13	99	29
1099	13	Yeah I wouldn't be surprised by that. I am interested too into what kind of research and goals that organization has too. I also wonder if that poor wolf ever had a mate before, it's sad :(	1	13	72	28
1099	14	It is really sad.  Like you said about why people like to hunt wildlife so much?  I think it	2	13	99	29
1099	15	I wonder if they are going to investigate to find who killed the wolf?	1	13	72	28
1099	16	I think they said something about that.  I don't know if they can catch the person who did this but it does bring awareness to these types of things.	2	13	99	29
1099	17	Yeah that's a good point	1	13	72	28
1099	18	Thank goodness for that group looking out for wolves, right?	2	13	99	29
1099	19	I mean I guess, I don't know I'm still not convinced that wolves are out number one priority. It's just new information to me that we should care about them?	1	13	72	28
1099	20	Maybe not our number one priority, but I think there is definitely room on the agenda. (:  I guess I have never given a lot of thought to wolves, but then again I didn't necessarily know that they were hunted. 	2	13	99	29
1099	21	Yeah, see, totally same! I'm interested and maybe a little surprised. But definitely sad to hear of a senseless killing.	1	13	72	28
1099	22	Absolutely!	2	13	99	29
1099	23	I wonder if they will take this opportunity to try and change their methods, too. Like maybe they will make their collars more obvious or put more signage along normal travel routes for the wolves or something	1	13	72	28
1099	24	Those are both great ideas.  The part about the signage I hadn't thought of.	2	13	99	29
1099	25	Yeah, did you feel any particular way when you first read the article?	1	13	72	28
1099	26	Yes.  Surprised and then very sad.  Also gave me a new perspective on wolves.  How about you?	2	13	99	29
1099	27	Yeah I would agree, a bit sad, but surprised and interested. Curious to learn more, too.	1	13	72	28
1099	28	Yes would love to hear more. What this group does, what states they are in.  Things like that.	2	13	99	29
1099	29	Yeah exactly, I am curious about what they do and what they protect. I might google them in a bit!	1	13	72	28
1099	30	Yes.  I hope for the best for them.  It has been a real pleasure chatting with you and sharing our thoughts and feelings about this.	2	13	99	29
1101	1	Hello	1	13	67	30
1101	2	Hi, how are you!  So glad to be matched!	2	13	101	31
1101	3	You sound excited :D Doing good, how are you?	1	13	67	30
1101	4	I have tried a few of these HITs and this is the first that seems to be going correctly, yea!	2	13	101	31
1101	5	"ah i see. Yes I tried one earlier and it just says ""Initializing"" forever. I submitted the HIT regardless although I wasn't connected to anyone after 20 minutes"	1	13	67	30
1101	6	Me too, I think I was paid.  Anyway this is a shorter article.  It was news to me about this agency and their work, had you heard of them before?	2	13	101	31
1101	7	"I have not heard of it before. I also have no heard of ""government snipers"""	1	13	67	30
1101	8	Right that comment or call out really did not align with trigger happy exterminators to me	2	13	101	31
1101	9	I wasn't sure who actually gunned the wolves down. Was it done for fun or some specific purpose? If it was done for fun, that was really cruel	1	13	67	30
1101	10	I agree.  Sounds like they are catching, and putting trackers on these animals then letting them do their thing.  If doing their thing may mean attacking I can see why some may want to eliminate them as predators	2	13	101	31
1101	11	I can see that. If the wolves are attacking children, pets etc, I probably would do something about it either. It really depends on the context. In this case, I am not really able to judge appropriately. But I am saddened by the killing definitely.	1	13	67	30
1101	12	Yes, I just looked up the center for bio diversity, it is relatively small but has doubled in size over the past several years	2	13	101	31
1101	13	Is it located in the west? 	1	13	67	30
1101	14	It is based out of Arizona	2	13	101	31
1101	15	That makes sense. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've seen wolves out where I am. I'm in the northeast 	1	13	67	30
1101	16	oh actually this is interesting, there is a map of wolf packs when I search the Huckleberry pack: https://pacificwolffamily.org/thehuckleberrypack/	2	13	101	31
1101	17	I thought they always travel in pack but the article says that they leave their pack in search of new territories	1	13	67	30
1101	18	Yes and I just assumed the pack was big, this one was only 7 members and I believe the local authorties killed it after killing sheep.  	2	13	101	31
1101	19	So the news is real?	1	13	67	30
1101	20	I think so at least it is documented elsewhere.  It also sounded like this was the lead female, I also assumed male but maybe females lead wolf packs due to breeding	2	13	101	31
1101	21	"""A young male wolf was tragically gunned down by a government sniper""--it says male here"	1	13	67	30
1101	22	Huh that does not align with what I was reading else where	2	13	101	31
1101	23	Maybe that was another wolf. Feel conflicted about this though, if the wolves are out there killing sheep, and if those were my sheep, I would probably want the authority to do something about it	1	13	67	30
1101	24	I agree fences can only do so much.  If we really want to save them maybe they should be in reserve somewhere	2	13	101	31
1101	25	Yes, I wonder how many Huckleberry pack wolves are gunned down per year. If they are at the brink of extinction, I think we should do way more than just putting a collar on them and tracking them	1	13	67	30
1101	26	right and that goes back to the pack size, I don't know if certain packs are unique breeds or just a unique pack and how big it may have once been	2	13	101	31
1101	27	"Maybe the Center for bio diversity should set up a help line or something for people to call them when the wolves are causing ""trouble"" "	1	13	67	30
1101	28	that would be a good idea, I was thinking these wolves need to be marked more than electronically - like visually, I know fur sheds but some type of florescent marker, like collar	2	13	101	31
1101	29	Like an ear tag	1	13	67	30
1101	30	that would be a good idea, I was thinking these wolves need to be marked more than electronically - like visually, I know fur sheds but some type of florescent marker, like collar	2	13	101	31
1102	1	Hi there, what was your first reaction overall from reading?	1	13	64	33
1102	2	light on facts, too emotional	2	13	49	32
1102	3	How did you feel about it being a story about a wolf instead of a person, did that matter to you?	1	13	64	33
1102	4	obviously that would be drastically different	2	13	49	32
1102	5	What was your first reaction when you learned the wolf got shot?	1	13	64	33
1102	6	i didn't know what to feel because i don't understand the reasons	2	13	49	32
1102	7	What emotions did you go through thinking about the wolf dying?	1	13	64	33
1102	8	confusion mainly	2	13	49	32
1102	9	What about the government sniper, how do you feel about him?	1	13	64	33
1102	10	a hell of a job title, doing his job i guess	2	13	49	32
1102	11	Did you think there could have been a better way for them to present the information about the wolves brutal deaths?	1	13	64	33
1102	12	sure they never explained the motivation	2	13	49	32
1102	13	I agree, I was wondering what could of driven that, did you think about anything other than the wolf?	1	13	64	33
1102	14	no not really	2	13	49	32
1102	15	Did you have strong emotions or light emotions?	1	13	64	33
1102	16	light emotions because lack of detail	2	13	49	32
1102	17	What about overall, how did you feel about it concluding everything, do you think it generic story?	1	13	64	33
1102	18	it was strange	2	13	49	32
1102	19	Do you think the scientists can actually do anything to stop the violence they mentioned?	1	13	64	33
1102	20	there has to be an official policy	2	13	49	32
1102	21	What about the activists, how do you feel about them overall?	1	13	64	33
1102	22	heart's in the right place	2	13	49	32
1102	23	Yeah I also feel that way, I do doubt their impact though. Do you think they have a small chance or large chance at succeeding?	1	13	64	33
1102	24	against the government? small chance	2	13	49	32
1102	25	Yeah, the courts specifically. Do you think the courts would even give them a fair chance at holding others accountable?	1	13	64	33
1102	26	if a law was broken then they have standing	2	13	49	32
1102	27	That may be true. Did you learn anything new from the story at all?	1	13	64	33
1102	28	"yeah it's strange when keeping a wolf alive counts as ""conservation"", but all the things the wolf killed... don't matter?"	2	13	49	32
1102	29	Maybe so, I'm not sure I have another way to look at it. I didn't have many thoughts about the story. Do you think it was a good story?	1	13	64	33
1102	30	no because there is a large lack of details	2	13	49	32
1105	1	Hello	1	13	102	35
1105	2	Hi, you read the article?	2	13	33	34
1105	3	I did yes, about the wolf?	1	13	102	35
1105	4	yup	2	13	33	34
1105	5	It did not really bother me.  I am fairly certain the wolf population is pretty strong.	1	13	102	35
1105	6	"Yeah. What I couldn't figure was: What is the story with the ""government sniper"" ?"	2	13	33	34
1105	7	Sounded like the person who wrote it was anti-hunting and took offense.  I am guessing they were culling the herd to protect farm animals or something.   Maybe it was attacking endangered species.	1	13	102	35
1105	8	Apparently he was doing target practice	2	13	33	34
1105	9	Did you look it up?	1	13	102	35
1105	10	no, but, There's very little info in this article to go by.	2	13	33	34
1105	11	Without some kind of information that says it was illegal I have no issue with it.	1	13	102	35
1105	12	"I was kind of joking about ""target practice"""	2	13	33	34
1105	13	I don't hunt though, never saw the fun in it.	1	13	102	35
1105	14	It has been said that there are animals such as the dire wolf that are approaching extinction.	2	13	33	34
1105	15	That would be a different story for me.	1	13	102	35
1105	16	Yup. I don't know. If it need to be killed, that's one thing.	2	13	33	34
1105	17	The author should have added real details	1	13	102	35
1105	18	I feel perhaps just as bad for the research team whose data the sniper destroyed.	2	13	33	34
1105	19	I wonder what the researchers think about it.	1	13	102	35
1105	20	it says that they go to court and fight for this sort of thing. Which is admirable, I guess.	2	13	33	34
1105	21	I think that there are better things to fight for.	1	13	102	35
1105	22	"The HIT says to express ""feelings"", but this is hardly a capital crime"	2	13	33	34
1105	23	Right, it's hard for me to give much of myself to it.	1	13	102	35
1105	24	"Not to overstate things, but I still wonder what capacity was the ""sniper"""	2	13	33	34
1105	25	"The only other mention was ""exterminators"""	1	13	102	35
1105	26	Yeah, that's right!	2	13	33	34
1105	27	I think it was just too slanted of an article	1	13	102	35
1105	28	I would say so. If that (the sniper) could have been expounded on, I may have more to relate.	2	13	33	34
1105	29	Yeah, there has to be something of substance before I could put a lot of care into it.	1	13	102	35
1105	30	700 miles is a long ride	2	13	33	34
1107	1	Hi!	1	13	104	36
1107	2	Hello!	2	13	105	37
1107	3	What was your first impression about the wolves article?	1	13	104	36
1107	4	Ugh. It kind of broke my heart to think about that young wolf working so hard to explore and try to find a pack/mate, only to be gunned down. :/ How about you?	2	13	105	37
1107	5	I understand. My first impression is that it will be difficult to prevent people from fighting back when they see a wolf hanging around. Although it's kind of sad, yes.	1	13	104	36
1107	6	Yeah, I can understand that they can be dangerous. I think they mostly attack livestock though, which I know farmers have a problem with too!	2	13	105	37
1107	7	I guess it's normal to feel sorry for the wolf but it's hard to tell what's right in that situation since the first thing that comes to mind is that it's dangerous.	1	13	104	36
1107	8	One thought that comes to mind is that maybe there needs to be a better thought out/coordinated plan. For example I'm sure the org that raised/protected the wolves must have known they would wander hundreds of miles, and likely into other states, right?	2	13	105	37
1107	9	If something is not well planned. They must take these situations into account and prevent them.	1	13	104	36
1107	10	Yes for sure. Like they could have coordinated in advance with the gov agencies in adjacent states to see if they would agree in advance to shoot the wolf with a tranquilizer gun instead or something, and transport it to a place like a wildnerness zone way up in the mountains or something. 	2	13	105	37
1107	11	It is difficult, perhaps if they do that the wolf will be disoriented and lost and will not be able to return to the pack. Although that's better than just being killed.	1	13	104	36
1107	12	Yes, for sure. I don't know about wolves and relocation, but whatever their plan was seems a bit shortsighted maybe. I know there was a similar story in California and a wolf traveled all the way down the cascades and then sierras, only to be hit by a car on the freeway in Southern California. Ugh.	2	13	105	37
1107	13	Well, it's complicated but there must be ways to prevent it. Maybe have them monitored and somehow prevent them from reaching certain places and zones.	1	13	104	36
1107	14	Yes, good idea. I had thought there are so few they are all monitored, but maybe not!	2	13	105	37
1107	15	They should give more importance to these issues and make them more public	1	13	104	36
1107	16	Yes I agree. And I have mixed feelings because I know the elimination of apex predators can have a domino effect on the environment, but at the same time, we don't live in wilderness with no fences any more, and a lot of the big predators have huge ranges. So I'm not sure what the right solution is!	2	13	105	37
1107	17	Could you tell me more about that domino effect you speak of?	1	13	104	36
1107	18	Well I read an article once about the effect of no wolves on the environment in Yellowstone, and from what I understand the lack of wolves caused a proliferation of deer, which stripped the bark from the trees, which led to other consequences, and the whole biome kind of got out of whack. Apparently since the reintroduction of wolves, it has righted itself!	2	13	105	37
1107	19	how interesting. I would like to learn more about these effects of the lack of certain predators	1	13	104	36
1107	20	"There might be a Netflix documentary on it? It was really interesting and I had no idea until I came across it. But I also know Yellowstone is unlike most places in the US, but I'm glad we are able to keep some places ""wild"" still."	2	13	105	37
1107	21	I'll take some time to watch those documentaries. It's good to know about those things.	1	13	104	36
1107	22	Yes, I agree. Somewhat sad, but better to know than to not know! ...Alaska still seems pretty wild too, so hopefully we can keep it that way. *fingers crossed*	2	13	105	37
1107	23	I love alaska and shows about self-sufficient people who live there. Returning to the subject of wolves, what would the wolf do if it found another territory to call its pack?	1	13	104	36
1107	24	I think it would have babies and start its own pack, no? But that is also a bit sad because like the one who showed up in SoCal, he would have never run into any other wolves and would have wandered forever in search I think. Poor guy!	2	13	105	37
1107	25	How would he have babies if he is alone. He would need a female, right?	1	13	104	36
1107	26	Yes, exactly. So I think the organizations usually start a pack or two up in certain places, but I have no idea what their plan is after that...	2	13	105	37
1107	27	Well, I think tonight I will see some videos of wolves	1	13	104	36
1107	28	I think I might too! I'll see what other content is out there and remind myself of the Yellowstone saga. It was pretty cool and I remember being quite moved by it.	2	13	105	37
1107	29	I will also look into that case in Yellowstone.	1	13	104	36
1107	30	I hope you enjoy and it was very nice talking with you!	2	13	105	37
1108	1	Hello	1	14	69	39
1108	2	Hi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.	2	14	60	38
1108	3	I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.	1	14	69	39
1108	4	Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.	2	14	60	38
1108	5	True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.	1	14	69	39
1108	6	Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.  Obviously most 52-year-olds have children, but to have it explicitly stated makes it strike home that those adult children just lost their dad.	2	14	60	38
1108	7	Yeah, I couldn't imagine losing my father suddenly like this. It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.	1	14	69	39
1108	8	Yes, I'm sure.  And I'm sure they were proud of him.  But I imagine that makes the loss even harder.	2	14	60	38
1108	9	Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?	1	14	69	39
1108	10	It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?	2	14	60	38
1108	11	I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. 	1	14	69	39
1108	12	Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.	2	14	60	38
1108	13	I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. 	1	14	69	39
1108	14	Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.  So I'm sure in an instance like this--in all that chaos--there's all sorts of incorrect information or speculation and that uncertainty is one of the reasons why the whole airport can get shut down.	2	14	60	38
1108	15	Yeah I suppose when there are lots of people in one place like this, when things go down it would be a bit crazy. Information may come in, but it has to be verified by looking at the footage, searching the airport, etc. Do you think anything could have been done to prevent the attack, or was it just something no one could have anticipated?	1	14	69	39
1108	16	It's hard to say without more evidence of what actually motivated it.  I think the reality is that if one deranged person wants to kill you, there's not a lot you can do to stop it.  That's just life, and we shouldn't turn the world upside down to stop things we can't stop.	2	14	60	38
1108	17	Yeah, once again I wish there was some more information here. I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.	1	14	69	39
1108	18	Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.	2	14	60	38
1108	19	I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.	1	14	69	39
1108	20	Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.	2	14	60	38
1108	21	I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.	1	14	69	39
1108	22	Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?	2	14	60	38
1108	23	Its hard to media that just sticks to the facts, and the stuff relevant to the story. Plus stuff that is truly unbiased. I'm really not sure what I'd want to learn. I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.	1	14	69	39
1108	24	Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.	2	14	60	38
1108	25	If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.	1	14	69	39
1108	26	Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.	2	14	60	38
1108	27	Yeah. Well it looks like we are coming to our final messages. Its been good talking with you. I'm glad you feel the same way about the article.	1	14	69	39
1108	28	Yes, thanks for chatting.  It's been good.	2	14	60	38
1108	29	Yeah, thank you, so long.	1	14	69	39
1108	30	Goodbye. Take care.  I hope you don't experience anything like this story.	2	14	60	38
1109	1	Hi, how are you?	1	14	67	40
1109	2	I'm well thanks, how about you?	2	14	102	41
1109	3	Doing good, thanks! So, what do you think about the article?	1	14	67	40
1109	4	It was pretty sad.  It's unfortunate to lose a loved one in such a violent and unexpected way.	2	14	102	41
1109	5	I feel the same way. I also feel saddened by the event. An attack on another human being shouldn't have happened in the first place	1	14	67	40
1109	6	Agreed.  What was solved, really?  What did the attacker get out of it?	2	14	102	41
1109	7	Revenge or to make themselves feel better. But that was not an excuse at all, they are evil! 	1	14	67	40
1109	8	And whatever positive emotions they did feel didn't last long considering they committed suicide.	2	14	102	41
1109	9	What's worse is the family who was left behind. I can't' imagine how I'd feel if I was them	1	14	67	40
1109	10	Both families are probably wrecked.  	2	14	102	41
1109	11	Such a mess as well. Hundreds of people were stranded in the airport	1	14	67	40
1109	12	Its too bad the attacker was so unhinged.  I wonder what caused it?	2	14	102	41
1109	13	Do you think this was a real crime? Maybe can find that out online	1	14	67	40
1109	14	I suppose we can Google the victim's name.  It was in the story, Michael Winchester	2	14	102	41
1109	15	Oh I think it's a true story	1	14	67	40
1109	16	Yeah, looks like it was revenge due to losing his job	2	14	102	41
1109	17	dang, that was such a stupid reason	1	14	67	40
1109	18	Yeah, it was just a job.  Find something else and move on.	2	14	102	41
1109	19	To be honest, in some way I am glad that the gunman died, but in another perspective, I think more effort should be put into mental health care and support	1	14	67	40
1109	20	For sure, this was something he could have dealt with constructively rather than what he chose	2	14	102	41
1109	21	Maybe the company should provide some kind of help as well when they are firing people	1	14	67	40
1109	22	He was terminated for drinking on the job.  Sounds like he was battling alcoholism.	2	14	102	41
1109	23	oh I see. I didn't see that part. Thanks for the context. This guy had so many issues!	1	14	67	40
1109	24	Things just kept piling up in his mind, I suppose.	2	14	102	41
1109	25	Killing other people and himself was probably his last resort... 	1	14	67	40
1109	26	His only way out	2	14	102	41
1109	27	Wish he could have gotten help and not ruin another person's life	1	14	67	40
1109	28	I wonder what his family thought before hand, how his mental state was?	2	14	102	41
1109	29	Agree. I think we have similar reactions and feelings towards this incidents	1	14	67	40
1109	30	Yes I think so.  The world failed both people, our handling of mental health issues just isn't up to par.	2	14	102	41
1110	1	Hello. did u  read the article?	1	14	61	43
1110	2	yes i did, it was pretty upsetting, what was your first reaction from it?	2	14	37	42
1110	3	I think it was such a tragedy, and I felt so bad for the victim the victims family and kind of a little bit angry as well because of the man who committed the crime it was unnecessary 	1	14	61	43
1110	4	It's horrible that someone would do something like this, especially at an airport where so many people are just trying to travel safely.	2	14	37	42
1110	5	yes I totally agree. There were so many people probably affected by it that had to witness it as well.	1	14	61	43
1110	6	What emotions did you get from it?	2	14	37	42
1110	7	sad and also, angry because of the man who committed the crime. What emotions did you get from it?	1	14	61	43
1110	8	I felt a mix of sadness, anger, and concern. Sadness for the victim and their family, anger towards the shooter for committing such a heinous act, and concern for the safety of everyone who was at the airport at the time of the shooting.	2	14	37	42
1110	9	 yes, I agree. That covers how I feel as well. 	1	14	61	43
1110	10	I also felt sympathy for Michael Winchester's family, especially his son who is a professional football player for the Kansas City Chiefs	2	14	37	42
1110	11	Yes, I saw that as well about his son plays for the Chiefs and his daughter is also a student athlete too	1	14	61	43
1110	12	It just goes to show that these tragedies could happen to anyone at any time	2	14	37	42
1110	13	 yes that's the truth. It's awful and scary to think that it could happen to anybody anywhere.	1	14	61	43
1110	14	I know!	2	14	37	42
1110	15	I'm curious and wondering how the guy got past airport security with a gun? 	1	14	61	43
1110	16	That is a good question, I guess someone dropped the ball	2	14	37	42
1110	17	Yeah, that's for sure! It never mentioned it in the article that I saw. Did you see anything about how the guy got past them with a gun? 	1	14	61	43
1110	18	I did not see any info about that, do you have any guesses as to how that could have happened?	2	14	37	42
1110	19	I don't know either I can't think of a possible way I remember the article said that he kind of stalked the guy (premeditated) I don't remember the exact wording though	1	14	61	43
1110	20	It's heart-wrenching to think about how much pain they must be going through right now	2	14	37	42
1110	21	I could not even imagine what it must be like to be them. That is just awful. I couldn't begin to comprehend, what it must be like.	1	14	61	43
1110	22	the article left me feeling deeply saddened and concerned about the safety of public spaces	2	14	37	42
1110	23	I think it is sad, and I think the news should report good things that happen as much as they do report the bad things that happen	1	14	61	43
1110	24	unfrotunately good news is not very popular and new companies are in the business of getting views	2	14	37	42
1110	25	 yep. In the business of getting views and making dollars. If they would refocus their way of thinking and try to focus on positive things, I think there's a lot of people out there that would be more attracted to watching the news.	1	14	61	43
1110	26	I agree, it could be worth a shot, I think there is a symbiotic relationship between media and the viewers, one could change the other	2	14	37	42
1110	27	Yes, for sure. I totally agree with you. I think unfortunately negativities spreads quicker than good things and I don't know why that is	1	14	61	43
1110	28	Misery loves company I guess haha	2	14	37	42
1110	29	That’s spot on lol	1	14	61	43
1110	30	Hopefully one day the world will be a better place	2	14	37	42
1113	1	hello	1	14	107	45
1113	2	Hey, how's it going today?	2	14	93	44
1113	3	going well. and yourself?	1	14	107	45
1113	4	Good, did you read the article about the Southwest guy getting killed?	2	14	93	44
1113	5	Yeah my article was bout someone getting gunned down in oklahoma city	1	14	107	45
1113	6	"Exactly, My first thoughts were ""I wonder why the guy killed him"". The article didn't give a reason."	2	14	93	44
1113	7	Yeah i just assumed they had to of known each other or something. seems a bit random, but i guess it happens	1	14	107	45
1113	8	At first, because it was at an airport, I assumed it was a crazy passenger, but they said it was premeditated.	2	14	93	44
1113	9	Yeah its crazy how people will just blow up and choose to go this level of violence 	1	14	107	45
1113	10	I don't get it either. Forget the fact that you are killing another person, but how can your life be so meaningless as well.	2	14	93	44
1113	11	exactly.  Makes me wonder what happened that was so bad that drove him to do that.  I will never understand why if a person gets mad their first reaction is to shoot the other person	1	14	107	45
1113	12	"That's what I fixated on as well, I hate to admit it, but a large part of me was wondering if he deserved it in some way, not that anyone ""deserves"" to be murdered."	2	14	93	44
1113	13	I totally see your point. I feel the same way.  Just like you said, no one deserves to be murdered or shot.  Must of been worth it to the guy who murdered him i guess. 	1	14	107	45
1113	14	It made me not so much sympathize with the guy who was killed, because I don't feel like I know the whole story. But, I greatly sympathized for his family. I can't imagine what they are going through.	2	14	93	44
1113	15	that is defiantly the roughest part of  all of this.  how the family feels. especially if the person had kids or a significant other.  Shame that todays age is so quick to just shoot someone because they had an altercation. 	1	14	107	45
1113	16	Honestly, I can't even imagine it. I'd be so angry if I were them. Angry about a lot of things probably.	2	14	93	44
1113	17	I know the feeling. i would be so angry about it. Not angry where i would want revenge etc. But i would want justice. 	1	14	107	45
1113	18	Yep. I'd be mad at the killer, mad that people have normalized crazy behavior in recent years. 	2	14	93	44
1113	19	indeed. it seems that more and more shootings are happening  I think its time we start checking the people buying the guns more 	1	14	107	45
1113	20	I agree, I grew up hunting but I don't get gun culture at all. That culture frightens me. 	2	14	93	44
1113	21	"it a big issue for sure. i do not specifically think it is just the ""guns"" fault . People can do bad stuff without guns. But i do feel that people need to be trained and screened more before getting one"	1	14	107	45
1113	22	Totally. I'm a gun owner. But, it's not part of my personality and too many people make guns and the implicit threat of violence a key part of their personality it seems.	2	14	93	44
1113	23	same here. i completely agree  100%. Society now has just become violent.. everyone is so quick to judge what your doing  or how your are doing it	1	14	107	45
1113	24	It's scary. I can tell you that I'm much more guarded with how I interact with strangers explicitly because of stories like this. 	2	14	93	44
1113	25	same, its sad because i want to be friendly to people and i am, but i hate the fact that i always have to be on my guard now. 	1	14	107	45
1113	26	I'm super polite, but always trying to end the interaction as quickly as possible. I'm not alone in that and I'm sure that my attitude does not help bring people closer together.	2	14	93	44
1113	27	Im the same way.. On a side note. I think this study has expired so i have no idea how im supposed to submit now for payment. Not sure if your timer expired as well 	1	14	107	45
1113	28	"I've still got timer left, I""ve messaged them before and I'm confident they'll make it right for you. "	2	14	93	44
1113	29	Thanks , ill try messaging them as well after this. i get nervous when timers run out. I thought there would be enough time but i was working on others in my que before i got to this one. 	1	14	107	45
1113	30	Totally understandable. I'm still thinking about this guy's family, how his son is in the NFL and how I bet they had a great relationship. It makes me want to call my dad.	2	14	93	44
1114	1	Hi	1	14	38	46
1114	2	hi	2	14	77	47
1114	3	Do you know A gunman murdered Southwest Airlines employee Michael Winchester, 52, then killed himself Tuesday at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport. 	1	14	38	46
1114	4	I have read about it	2	14	77	47
1114	5	Police said the attack was premeditated; the suspect appeared to have known the victim's schedule and routine.	1	14	38	46
1114	6	I think so	2	14	77	47
1114	7	I think Hundreds of people were stranded inside the terminal for more than three hours before officers began letting them leave slowly.	1	14	38	46
1114	8	yeah thats true, I would be so angry if I were in there position 	2	14	77	47
1114	9	I am so impressed your answer.	1	14	38	46
1114	10	what emotions did you get while reading  the article?	2	14	77	47
1114	11	I felt emotional while reading the article.	1	14	38	46
1114	12	what were you thinking about while reading the article 	2	14	77	47
1114	13	I feel very realistic.	1	14	38	46
1114	14	is that so?	2	14	77	47
1115	1	Hii	1	14	47	48
1115	2	Hii	2	14	51	49
1115	3	I think a gunman murdered Southwest Airlines employee	1	14	47	48
1115	4	Really very sad for this situation	2	14	51	49
1115	5	Police said the attack was premeditated; the suspect appeared to have known the victim's schedule and routine.	1	14	47	48
1115	6	This is highly realistic and more compensive for all the civilization	2	14	51	49
1115	7	This is very disappointment for all the civilization	1	14	47	48
1115	8	His  son, James, currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, while his daughter Becca was also a student athlete there.	2	14	51	49
1115	9	Hundreds of people were stranded inside the terminal for more than three hours before officers began letting them leave slowly.	1	14	47	48
1115	10	My thought was thus suspect appeared to have known the victim's schedule and routine. The suspect was later found dead in a pickup truck in a public parking garage.	2	14	51	49
1115	11	I have fully analyzed for entire story and give the proper response for all the situation.	1	14	47	48
1115	12	Absolutely. This is right for everyone.	2	14	51	49
1115	13	Mostly attacked by police to all the people and survive was very dangerous	1	14	47	48
1115	14	I think this is fault of our government and voting of the people	2	14	51	49
1115	15	May be it is correct and well describe	1	14	47	48
1115	16	Our feedback was perfectly matched for this situation.	2	14	51	49
1115	17	Ya....	1	14	47	48
1115	18	I have known the victim's schedule and routine. The suspect was later found dead in a pickup truck in a public parking garage.	2	14	51	49
1115	19	Correct	1	14	47	48
1115	20	Inbound flights were diverted to other airports, while a jet carrying inmates to a transfer site was allowed to land.	2	14	51	49
1115	21	May be Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said in a statement that the airline would cancel all flights scheduled to depart for a distance.	1	14	47	48
1115	22	May be correct	2	14	51	49
1116	1	hello. did you finish reading the article? what emotions did it make u feel?	1	14	61	50
1116	2	yeah, it made me feel curious as to the reason why the victim was murdered 	2	14	64	51
1116	3	 I was wondering the same thing. But most of all, I do feel sorry for the victim and his family. It's tragic and heartbreaking.	1	14	61	50
1116	4	yeah, I feel bad for the family and victim too, it must have a real shock to the family	2	14	64	51
1116	5	I couldn't even imagine how heartbreaking and shocking that had to of been for the family. It's devastating to even think about how awful that was. I know from experience when you get bad news like that, it affects everybody in a different way.	1	14	61	50
1116	6	what was your experience?	2	14	64	51
1116	7	 oh well, five years ago my best friend was murdered in a domestic violence incident we grew up together we were best friends our entire lives did everything together. We even lived next-door to each other, we both moved once and then ended up neighbors again, but her boyfriend killed her, and then he killed himself. That's what makes me think of this article when I read it.	1	14	61	50
1116	8	sounds terrible how did you get over it?	2	14	64	51
1116	9	 I don't think it's something you really get over you just Gotta learn to live with it honestly	1	14	61	50
1116	10	did you receive any mental health help	2	14	64	51
1116	11	 I think that's what made me think and wonder what was going through this dude's head that committed the crime. It seems like a crime of can't think of the word right now, but he likes talked that dude at the airport for days it said I think? 	1	14	61	50
1117	1	hello	1	14	91	53
1117	2	hi	2	14	66	52
1117	3	Airlines woker gunned down for suspect found dead? what do you think?	1	14	91	53
1117	4	I cannot believe someone even got a gun into an airport. I cannot believe how many shootings there are anymore. It seems like a daily event.	2	14	66	52
1117	5	Yes but show on 52 kilss.	1	14	91	53
1117	6	it is sad.	2	14	66	52
1117	7	Very sad news you know full of blood hu.	1	14	91	53
1117	8	i think something needs to be done to stop these killings	2	14	66	52
1117	9	Ye police can take action about this news	1	14	91	53
1117	10	i don't know do you think they will do anything	2	14	66	52
1117	11	yes	1	14	91	53
1117	12	what will they do	2	14	66	52
1117	13	Attack the premeditated	1	14	91	53
1117	14	they didn't do anything	2	14	66	52
1117	15	why	1	14	91	53
1117	16	you are asking the wrong person, with the amount of TSA and police at airports they did not stop this	2	14	66	52
1117	17	yes 	1	14	91	53
1117	18	i think we need laws and rules to stop the guns and people, then the police can get involved what do you think	2	14	66	52
1117	19	Definitely correct your idea. nice	1	14	91	53
1117	20	it probably starts with a change in politicians who are backed by the NRA. do you agree	2	14	66	52
1117	21	yes	1	14	91	53
1117	22	i hope we see some change soon	2	14	66	52

1118	2	Hello!	2	14	108	55
1118	3	The artticle wasn't surprising really. We have shootings everyday anymore	1	14	38	54
1118	4	Its horrible isn't it? I hate how numb to it I'm becoming.	2	14	108	55
1118	5	It's a shame really! Numb is the way I would put it as well	1	14	38	54
1118	6	I imagine a lot of us are feeling it at this point	2	14	108	55
1118	7	I would say you are correct. It's bad when you get your mass shootings confused...lol	1	14	38	54
1118	8	Exactly! 	2	14	108	55
1118	9	I do feel horrible for the families	1	14	38	54
1118	10	Oh absolutely, I can't imagine having someone you love die violently	2	14	108	55
1118	11	I couldn't either, and we live with that fear every time we send our kids out the door to school	1	14	38	54
1118	12	Thats the scariest part, its so scary that we have to prepare kids for that	2	14	108	55
1118	13	"yeah it gives a whole new meaning to ""the talk"""	1	14	38	54
1118	14	ha, it really does...aside from the depressing article how's your day going?	2	14	108	55
1118	15	Not bad so far, thanks for asking! How has your day been?	1	14	38	54
1118	16	Good, i'm planting some flowers in between jobs before it gets too hot	2	14	108	55
1118	17	That sounds fun! where are you from?	1	14	38	54
1118	18	Northern WA, you?	2	14	108	55
1118	19	Ahh thats really cool! I'm from Kentucky...down south..lol	1	14	38	54
1118	20	Omg I'm from Louisville!	2	14	108	55
1118	21	WOW!!! How awesome is that! Im in Lexington!!!	1	14	38	54
1118	22	I miss it every single day, haven't been back in about 25 years	2	14	108	55
1118	23	Wow..Thats kinda sad because I look for ways to get out of here everyday. I want to move out west. I've been here for 40 years, it's time to move on for me	1	14	38	54
1118	24	Well northern WA is beautiful but way too expensive for my tastes	2	14	108	55
1118	25	Yeah thats one thing that keeps me here. The cost of living isn't horrible	1	14	38	54
1118	26	And the fried chicken...you will NEVER have good real fried chicken here lol	2	14	108	55
1118	27	lol..I bet! We have recently had a few shootings in Louisville	1	14	38	54
1118	28	I saw that! He was from my high school!	2	14	108	55
1118	29	wow...im sorry to hear that	1	14	38	54
1118	30	Yeah, way too small world in that case...I think this might be the end of that chat, it was great talking to you	2	14	108	55
1120	1	The constant fighting, airstrikes, and shelling have made the people of Yemen forced millions to flee their homes	1	15	70	57
1120	2	Hello	2	15	48	56
1120	3	Hello	1	15	70	57
1120	4	I couldn't imagine having to flee my home along with millions other	2	15	48	56
1120	5	It's also tragic that those who were supposed to be protected in prisons died too	1	15	70	57
1120	6	Yes and that some of those bombings were errors and accomplished nothing	2	15	48	56
1120	7	Not only tragic but also a violation of international humanitarian law.	1	15	70	57
1120	8	I understand they wanted to install a president but are civilian lives worth it?	2	15	48	56
1120	9	he U.N. peace proposal was rejected by the government, so they need to install someone else	1	15	70	57
1120	10	Stories like this make me grateful I live in the US. I cant imagine being scared I will be bombed everywhere I go	2	15	48	56
1120	11	Yeah and they even bombed a funeral hall in Sanaa. That is just disgraceful.	1	15	70	57
1120	12	Yes they probably that they were safe at a funeral hall. I wonder if those families every get some sort of compensation from the UN	2	15	48	56
1120	13	Aid organizations, healthcare workers, and others are helping but they're putting their lives at a huge risk in Yemen	1	15	70	57
1120	14	Things like this get a lot of support in the beginning then people who arent effected move on	2	15	48	56
1120	15	It's shows the resiliance and strength of the Yemeni people	1	15	70	57
1120	16	I wonder what the outcome of the air strikes? Was Hadi restored?	2	15	48	56
1120	17	Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi has returned to the Saudi capital Riyadh after routine medical treatment in the United States, according to his Twitter account	1	15	70	57
1120	18	What is he receiving medical treatment for?	2	15	48	56
1120	19	I don't know, it just says routine medical treatment	1	15	70	57
1120	20	I wonder how many US troops are still in Yemen	2	15	48	56
1120	21	iden confirmed that the U.S. has deployed troops to Yemen with the aim of battling extremist groups and continuing military support for the Saudi-led coalition.	1	15	70	57
1120	22	I know the US wants to see Yemen stabilize and thrive.	2	15	48	56
1121	1	hi	1	15	77	59
1121	2	Hey, how are you?	2	15	69	58
1121	3	fine thank you, how about you?	1	15	77	59
1121	4	I'm good. What did you think of the article?	2	15	69	58
1121	5	What was the article you read about? mine was about an airstrike in Yemen. 	1	15	77	59
1121	6	I had the same one about the Yemen airstrikes I believe.	2	15	69	58
1121	7	I think that the loss of life is not really necessary, there are other ways of solving  conflicts	1	15	77	59
1121	8	True, they are in a tough situation out there. I wish there could be some sort of agreement to stop the loss of life.	2	15	69	58
1121	9	what emotions did the article give you?	1	15	77	59
1121	10	It was sad for me to hear what's going on. I have a friend from Yemen, who luckily got out with his family a few years back. I know there are still so many people stuck there in this crisis though, its tough to think about. How about you?	2	15	69	58
1121	11	what can countries like ours do to help this waring countries?	1	15	77	59
1121	12	I think we can help, at least I think that's better than doing nothing. Providing food, health supplies, and in some cases refuge. What do you think other countries should be doing to help, if anything? 	2	15	69	58
1121	13	i agree with you	1	15	77	59
1121	14	Cool, do you think the US military should be involved in the conflicts?	2	15	69	58
1121	15	Yes definitely but not the way it is currently 	1	15	77	59
1121	16	Yeah, I think they should be involved when helping allies, or when protecting against threats to the US. Its just upsetting when civilians and innocent people end up getting killed as a result.	2	15	69	58
1121	17	It is sad for innocents to get caught up in it	1	15	77	59
1121	18	Do you think the civil conflict there will ever be resolved? It seems like it has gone on for so long.	2	15	69	58
1121	19	I am not sure about that, it is in human nature to always have conflicts 	1	15	77	59
1121	20	Yeah, its sad to think about but I see no easy way for it to come to an end, especially after peace proposals have been repeatedly rejected.	2	15	69	58
1121	21	true. if we could use robots to fight wars instead  of humans that would be nice	1	15	77	59
1121	22	Haha that would be nice. Robots or maybe agree to roll the dice to see who wins. Really any way to keep civilians out of it.	2	15	69	58
1121	23	yes no loss of life	1	15	77	59
1121	24	Do you think the US media has done enough to show what's going on in Yemen? I feel like I hardly hear anything about the conflict anymore.	2	15	69	58
1121	25	No, and the reason they have not is lack of access. The media is usually restricted from covering such events	1	15	77	59
1121	26	They are? I didn't know that. Is it like a security thing?	2	15	69	58
1121	27	i agree with you	1	15	77	59
1121	28	OK. Well I think we're coming to the end of our messages, its been good chatting with you!	2	15	69	58
1121	29	you too. until next time.	1	15	77	59
1121	30	Farewell	2	15	69	58
1144	1	hello. Did you read the article and how did you feel about it what was your first reaction 	1	16	61	73
1144	2	Hello	2	16	111	72
1144	3	what was your first reaction of the article	1	16	61	73
1144	4	made me feel very scared, how did you feel after you read the article	2	16	111	72
1144	5	 I'm sorry that it made you feel scared. I sympathize with you. 	1	16	61	73
1144	6	How did it make you feel	2	16	111	72
1144	7	I felt bad for the people that live there. That's my first thought. I feel really bad for the people that live there and probably can't do anything about it to leave because it sounds like a real crappy place in my opinion	1	16	61	73
1144	8	I don't really understand what the war is about do you?	2	16	111	72
1144	9	 from my understanding there were rebels that were given an ultimatum to lay down their arms and if not they were going to be killed it also said the article was from CNN so I don't take too much stock and anything that comes from there 	1	16	61	73
1144	10	I read that to but that's not what the war is about.  I would like to find out. 	2	16	111	72
1144	11	It doesn't say specifically but it mentions some things like when it referred to how Russia is there a major player with the president and government over there and how syria is trying to gain control over the city but I I don't understand completely myself honestly 	1	16	61	73
1144	12	Either way I cannot not imagine having to live like that how about you	2	16	111	72
1144	13	 I could not imagine living like that. I am very thankful to be an American and living in the United States. There is absolutely no way I would ever want to live in Syria with that type of stuff going on that's for sure. The article also talked about Isis and some things about the Kurds they talked about a lot of the groups over there  	1	16	61	73
1144	14	It's really quite crazy to think this is going on in our world right now as we chat	2	16	111	72
1144	15	yes i agree. After I had sent that last message I started thinking maybe that is one of the reasons that it is going on over there  because it says something about Isis and having a strong hold over a city over there 	1	16	61	73
1144	16	are you a real person? who really read the article	2	16	111	72
1144	17	lol yes I am not a robot lol I had this conversation like this the other day when we had to prove we weren't robots lol I am a real person I have a worker ID number and everything how about you? And yes I read the article did you read the article? 	1	16	61	73
1144	18	Yes I ready the article usually these tasks tell you after the fact you were not talking with a real person.  Do you have anyone you know over there?	2	16	111	72
1144	19	i understand and i I always hate that at the end when you get told then that it was a robot or they were so much deception involved it tends to really irritate me lol but I have listed  major points of the article, and just because I don't fully understand it or understand why it happened doesn't mean I'm not real lol 	1	16	61	73
1144	20	Yes i know.  Do you know of anyone who lives over there?	2	16	111	72
1144	21	no I do not know anyone who lives over there. Do you? Do you have family or anything over there or friends? 	1	16	61	73
1144	22	No I don't but there was that couple on 90 day fiancé.  She changed her religion and moved over there to marry, but they would never be able to move the US 	2	16	111	72
1144	23	Oh my gosh are you serious? I have not watched that show but I know of that show 	1	16	61	73
1144	24	Yes, it was very interesting.  Even to see eachother they had to meet in certain countries because he was syrian	2	16	111	72
1144	25	oh wow! Tell me more about that lol where did they go to meet and stuff? How did they meet like for the first time? lol	1	16	61	73
1144	26	If I remember right they went to Bali or something because syria is considered a terrorist country they are not allowed in many countries or something	2	16	111	72
1144	27	 yes Syria is considered a terrorist country. They are involved and a lot of terrorist groups come out of Syria. But this 90 day fiancé show sounds rather interesting lol what is it a whole season based on this I don't know why this just grabbed my attention but it sounds really interesting. Sounds complicated too lol	1	16	61	73
1144	28	lol, yes. It's reality tv so they have a season on how they meet, then if they get serious the apply for a visa to get married and have 90 days to do it.  It fun and crazy all at the same time.  	2	16	111	72
1144	29	lol that sounds pretty cool pretty interesting to watch lol I never watched it myself and I never really should have judged it as a reality show and not being interesting or some thing I guess because I never gave it a chance if that makes sense 	1	16	61	73
1144	30	But reading that article made me recall that season and part of their dilema was where they would live.  She couldn't go to syria as they would kill her but he had to go to finish like his schooling or something.	2	16	111	72
1145	1	Hello	1	16	112	70
1145	2	hello	2	16	113	71
1145	3	what did you think of the article?	1	16	112	70
1145	4	it made me sad	2	16	113	71
1145	5	It was quite distressing to read for me. I am not a fan of war	1	16	112	70
1145	6	i think Syria is being unfairly attacked	2	16	113	71
1145	7	I agree. Many innocent people are getting harmed.	1	16	112	70
1145	8	the food shortages were alarming	2	16	113	71
1145	9	What did you think about the warning message sent to residents of Aleppo? How did it make you feel?	1	16	112	70
1145	10	that would be a shocking warning message to receive, it made me feel alarmed and shocked	2	16	113	71
1145	11	Yes me too.	1	16	112	70
1145	12	i think the amount of people being killed in Syria is being censored	2	16	113	71
1145	13	Probably to keep others from panicking. The article mentions the lack of aid and supplies in Aleppo. Do you think more can be done to help the civilians affected by the conflict? If so, what do you think should be done?	1	16	112	70
1145	14	Yes, the Turkish government and other entities such as the USA proxy armies should stop attacking Syria	2	16	113	71
1145	15	I agree. The USA seems to have their nose in everyone's business.	1	16	112	70
1145	16	USA has a global war machine	2	16	113	71
1145	17	What do you think needs to happen for the conflict in Aleppo to come to an end and for the people there to begin to rebuild their lives?	1	16	112	70
1145	18	it would be good for Turkey and USA and others to stop funding the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other entities that are attacking the innocent Syrian people	2	16	113	71
1145	19	I think so as well. Now when do we get this code. It has been more than 15 respones	1	16	112	70
1145	20	we have to do 15 responses each, i think it is interesting that countries have these battles with each other but they all have a treaty together for Antarctica	2	16	113	71
1145	21	Yes, Antarctica seems to have a lot of attention from people and yet we still don't know all about it. 	1	16	112	70
1145	22	i recently read about the Flat Earth Theory saying that Antarctica is an ice wall 	2	16	113	71
1145	23	I'll have to read into that. The article mentions that the Syrian government is accusing rebels of using civilians as human shields. What do you think about this accusation? Do you think it is a valid argument or an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas?	1	16	112	70
1145	24	it is probably an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas, i think Syria is telling the truth and the opposition is lying	2	16	113	71
1145	25	It also mentioned that the UN warned that eastern Aleppo was on the brink of starvation. Do you think that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in situations like this to prevent mass suffering?	1	16	112	70
1145	26	"the ""international community"" seems to want to starve Syria perhaps because Syria is not willing to use the same monetary system as other countries?"	2	16	113	71
1145	27	That is an interesting way to think about it. 	1	16	112	70
1145	28	the United Nations and other entities want globalism with a one-world currency and one-world religion for maximum control	2	16	113	71
1145	29	So true. Sorry i'm running out of questions to ask	1	16	112	70
1145	30	what do you think is the proper future number for the global human population?	2	16	113	71
1150	1	Hello, hope you are well	1	16	119	75
1150	2	Hello	2	16	72	74
1150	3	Honestly I found the article overall sad especially with them having to abandon the area in 24 hours	1	16	119	75
1150	4	So did I. Very tragic	2	16	72	74
1150	5	If only something could be done	1	16	119	75
1150	6	I think the article was quite dated though	2	16	72	74
1150	7	Really? I was reading though the entire article and I was so focused that I could not find the date	1	16	119	75
1150	8	I seem to recall this happened a while back. Nevertheless, very sad to read	2	16	72	74
1150	9	Yep, especially the idea of them potentially starving too	1	16	119	75
1150	10	Yes, it's hard to imagine going through that	2	16	72	74
1150	11	A lot of people hopefully never have to go though an experience like that	1	16	119	75
1150	12	It shows the risks of a fragmented society	2	16	72	74
1150	13	Definitely but then you stop and think. Why is Russia getting involved in this Syrian Civil war? 	1	16	119	75
1150	14	And why is Turkey?	2	16	72	74
1150	15	Exactly, what does Turkey have to do with this as well	1	16	119	75
1150	16	Great power rivalry I suppose	2	16	72	74
1150	17	I suppose so, but overall nothing we can do as much we would like to	1	16	119	75
1150	18	I agree, I wish we could	2	16	72	74
1150	19	It further shows you the tragedy of war and why people should not be rooting for it	1	16	119	75
1150	20	What can we do though?	2	16	72	74
1150	21	Probably tell our US government that first of all war should never be celebrated	1	16	119	75
1150	22	DO they listen?	2	16	72	74
1150	23	Of course not, see what they are doing with Ukraine. There is no peace yet, and it just enriches the biggest weapon manufacturers.	1	16	119	75
1150	24	I agree	2	16	72	74
1150	25	Even though I see the war between Russia and Ukraine, as something Russia started. Sending more weapons definitely should be off the table	1	16	119	75
1150	26	It's important to vote	2	16	72	74
1150	27	It's, not like either party cares honestly	1	16	119	75
1150	28	Likely true, sadly	2	16	72	74
1150	29	Then again going back to the topic on hand, we would see if the war in Syria eventually ends	1	16	119	75
1150	30	I hope it does soon	2	16	72	74
1163	1	Hello	1	17	130	77
1163	2	Hi	2	17	131	76
1163	3	So what did you think about the article?	1	17	130	77
1163	4	I thought it was rather depressing but honest. How about you?	2	17	131	76
1163	5	Same. It's horrible what those people are going through. I wish something could be done.	1	17	130	77
1163	6	I feely you...when I read things like that I feel so helpless	2	17	131	76
1163	7	Yeah, no amount of human suffering is worth a war.	1	17	130	77
1163	8	It all seems so futile, especially since the average family is the one who suffers the most, not the actual fighters.	2	17	131	76
1163	9	Yep, the citizens are the ones who are displaced and end up starving to death.	1	17	130	77
1163	10	I can't help but think what would happen to my grandmother and family if there was a war like this in the US	2	17	131	76
1163	11	I think about the same thing. It's one of the reasons I fear a global conflict.	1	17	130	77
1163	12	It could just as easily happen anywhere. It is scary and again makes me feel helpless.	2	17	131	76
1163	13	Yep. I just wish all sides would just calm down and work things out diplomatically.	1	17	130	77
1163	14	Yeah but the Good Ole Boys Club will never let that happen.	2	17	131	76
1163	15	Nope, there is just too much money to be made from weapons and defense contracts.	1	17	130	77
1163	16	Exactly. The people at the root don't have to deal with the problems mentioned in the article	2	17	131	76
1163	17	No, they don't deal with the problem, but sadly they're usually the ones creating it.	1	17	130	77
1163	18	Yes that's exactly what I mean. They make decisions that create major trickle down life and death scenarios constantly	2	17	131	76
1163	19	People need to start voting for better leaders. Assuming they're a democracy, anyway.	1	17	130	77
1163	20	In an ideal world that would help.	2	17	131	76
1163	21	Yep. I wish more places would embrace the democratic process -- then a lot of this could be prevented.	1	17	130	77
1163	22	Yes but even democratic countries go to war and are capable of causing this kind of suffering	2	17	131	76
1163	23	Yeah, I guess democracy doesn't do a lot of good if the country is filled with warmongering voters.	1	17	130	77
1163	24	Well said. I thought the point about the hospitals not being able to handle the chronic health issues of the elderly was an interesting and sad point as well	2	17	131	76
1163	25	Yeah, they are too busy tending to battlefield wounds. It's sad. The man who lives with his ten children and grandchildren really stuck with me. I can't imagine living in fear of an airstrike on your house at any given moment.	1	17	130	77
1163	26	Right? It would be so exhausting and frustrating to live like that.	2	17	131	76
1163	27	It makes me grateful for what I have and where I live.	1	17	130	77
1163	28	No kidding. I don't think I'd be able to handle that kind of life.	2	17	131	76
1163	29	Nope. Those people are a lot stronger than I am.	1	17	130	77
1163	30	I found myself wondering how they get through the day.	2	17	131	76
1164	1	Hello, what did you think about the article?	1	17	132	79
1164	2	it was dramatic	2	17	113	78
1164	3	It was, but also realistic. 	1	17	132	79
1164	4	that war on Syria is sad and wrong	2	17	113	78
1164	5	I agree. There are so many wars going on around the world. I also wonder how I can help.	1	17	132	79
1164	6	The USA likes waging many wars	2	17	113	78
1164	7	What do you think is the main cause of war. Land, money, or something else?	1	17	132	79
1164	8	land	2	17	113	78
1164	9	It seems so counter productive to me, that they destroy the land they want.	1	17	132	79
1164	10	they destroy it so they can rebuild it for more profit and power	2	17	113	78
1164	11	That makes sense. Have you ever experienced war first hand?	1	17	132	79
1164	12	not on the frontlines	2	17	113	78
1164	13	I have not either. I guess that's a blessing.	1	17	132	79
1164	14	some might say there is a war on the USA with inflation and food factories on fire and train derailments	2	17	113	78
1164	15	True. It's like a silent war.	1	17	132	79
1164	16	i think the say groups waging war on Syria are also waging war on USA	2	17	113	78
1164	17	It's unfortunate to have these groups become so powerful and during these wars the most vulnerable population are left to fend for themselves. 	1	17	132	79
1164	18	i think there is a global population happening in Syria and also the USA	2	17	113	78
1164	19	A global population? Like a reduction?	1	17	132	79
1164	20	yep, groups like the United Nations want to reduce the population from 8 billion to a lower number	2	17	113	78
1164	21	Oh that's horrible, I guess that will address the baby boomer issue as that group is left alone.	1	17	132	79
1164	22	people are having fewer kids, becoming more sterile, and also being trained to feel guilty about having kids	2	17	113	78
1164	23	Absolutely, it feels like having a child is the irresponsible things to do Moms are shamed all of the time.	1	17	132	79
1164	24	the person in the story had 10 children and grandchildren living with them, quite an ordeal in a war situation	2	17	113	78
1164	25	Yes there's a lot of mouths to feed and if a bomb hit's their home, the whole family would be lost.	1	17	132	79
1164	26	yes, the food shortages must be very stressful	2	17	113	78
1164	27	And I wonder how their water supply is affected.	1	17	132	79
1164	28	probably, they are trying to wear Syria down, but the people of Syria have held strong for many years	2	17	113	78
1164	29	They have been in war for a long time, but stand strong and united no matter what.	1	17	132	79
1164	30	Hopefully the people of the USA will also stay strong.	2	17	113	78
1170	1	Hello?	1	17	135	81
1170	2	Hi there!	2	17	136	80
1170	3	Hi! So, how did you feel about the article?	1	17	135	81
1170	4	It left me a bit depressed and sad. How about you?	2	17	136	80
1170	5	Me too... I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to spend the final years of your life in a country with so much war.	1	17	135	81
1170	6	Right, I'm in the U.S. and some of this feel so removed even though it's really not.	2	17	136	80
1170	7	Me too. It's hard to imagine, but at the same time, I know it's real for some people...	1	17	135	81
1170	8	Definitely, it made me think about the circumstances under which I would even consider leaving my parents. Maybe if I had young kids or something, but I cannot get my head around it.	2	17	136	80
1170	9	Agreed. I don't think I could ever rest easily knowing that my parents lives are at risk like that.	1	17	135	81
1170	10	I guess the article also made me angry at how civilians get caught up in armed conflicts and are used by both/all sides.	2	17	136	80
1170	11	I can agree with that. In war, it seems like civilians are seen simply as numbers, rather than human beings living real lives. It's hard to accept that some people are dehumanized in that way. We'd never accept such a thing happening in the U.S.	1	17	135	81
1170	12	"Right, I know we try to ""minimize"" collateral damage but that it is inevitable in these situation. Still hard to comprehend."	2	17	136	80
1170	13	I wonder if there's another way. Does one really have to kill innocent people in order to make a point?	1	17	135	81
1170	14	Society would have to change a lot for us to get to that point but it does seem like there have to be better ways.	2	17	136	80
1170	15	Yeah, it would take a lot of effort on both sides in order to get to that point, but I hope that some day, innocent people don't have to lose their lives over a fight they're not involved in...	1	17	135	81
1170	16	In the article, I was curious that the one person remaining in Aleppo in the home he built had 10 children living with him. If he's that elderly, I thought they would be in their 40s or 50s which was odd.	2	17	136	80
1170	17	Huh, I never thought about it like that. I suppose so. Wouldn't they have children of their own at that point?	1	17	135	81
1170	18	That's what I was thinking, but just curious about it. I need to do some more specific research about Syria itself and the conflict there too.	2	17	136	80
1170	19	Yeah, hearing about it, it almost feels like they're living in an entirely different world. I wonder if it's standard for children to stay in the home for that long?	1	17	135	81
1170	20	I suspect in other cultures. I lived in a developing country and it was so different from the U.S., multiple generations in one home or next to each other. Grandparents took care of little kids while parents worked. People took care of grandparents, etc., no retirement, government assistance.	2	17	136	80
1170	21	Oh, did you? That's interesting. It seems like other countries are more collectivist - more oriented toward taking care of the family than toward individual success.	1	17	135	81
1170	22	Right, LOL....my parents have absolutely no desire to live with me or my sibling, so very different expectations.	2	17	136	80
1170	23	Lol, I would imagine that my parents would be the same, yes. Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything. Grandparents would be forced to live with their kids and be taken care of by them, or they wouldn't be able to pay for food or shelter.	1	17	135	81
1170	24	Right...although I imagine my parents would probably push me to leave with kids if the situation were like Aleppo even if I didn't want to do it.	2	17	136	80
1170	25	Yeah... I imagine it'd be hard to suddenly relocate after building a whole life in one place, but I think that the person from the story would find a lot of peace leaving and finding somewhere else to live.	1	17	135	81
1170	26	I was thinking more in terms of frailty and health conditions but if the guy in the story could leave with the family....that size seems like they could manage assisting a couple of elderly folks.	2	17	136	80
1170	27	Yeah, I wonder what the children's opinions of the situation are, now that I'm thinking about it. I imagine at least one of them would have suggested leaving.	1	17	135	81
1170	28	Yes and you have the one kid who came back from Turkey and got stuck so must be incredibly difficult to leave. There's a sense of hopelessness with the options too, I imagine.	2	17	136	80
1170	29	Yeah... It seems that way. I wish I could show these people a better life somehow. It's so sad that people are forced to live their only life in the midst of a warzone. I know it's improbable, but I still wish I could.	1	17	135	81
1170	30	Same, it makes me wonder how many people live in these active conflict zone and then others are in refugee camps, etc., and basically can't leave.	2	17	136	80
1171	1	Whatd you think of the article?	1	18	137	89
1171	2	I thought it was interesting but I was curious to know how the polar bears' populations have changed during the time discussed.	2	18	60	88
1171	3	I agree, there wasn't much information given in that area	1	18	137	89
1171	4	I'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.  Life doesn't usually just roll over and die.  It adapts and finds a way.  I'm curious how their behavior is changing.	2	18	60	88
1171	5	It is tough without the population data because they could be handling very well	1	18	137	89
1171	6	Yes, I suppose.  I'm not sure that's likely, but it's possible. They're big, impressive creatures.  But even they're weak compared to nature.	2	18	60	88
1171	7	I read more into the article being that of a expected time shift, something that happens every so often to the Earth	1	18	137	89
1171	8	It's true that lots of things about earth change over time.  We tend to think of what we know of earth as how it's SUPPOSED to be.  But the reality is that polar bears have existed on earth for the blink of an eye compared to the time they haven't existed on earth, let alone in the universe.	2	18	60	88
1171	9	I'm hoping that is what is causing the shifts, tough problem to solve on a global scale	1	18	137	89
1171	10	Yes, it's a very difficult problem to solve.  Does the thought of polar bears dying out make you sad, or does it make you happy because it means fewer seals are being eaten by polar bears?	2	18	60	88
1171	11	Definitely sad since that means that others can't experience also	1	18	137	89
1171	12	Polar bears are a unique and impressive species.  Have you ever seen one in person?  I've seen them at the Denver Zoo.	2	18	60	88
1171	13	Yeah I've seen one at the Cincinnati Zoo. Couldn't imagine not having polar bears around	1	18	137	89
1171	14	Do you think they'll adapt to their changing conditions?	2	18	60	88
1171	15	If the season is just shifting yes. Whats your viewpoint	1	18	137	89
1171	16	I think their behavior will definitely change.  If the ice patterns, which dictate their hunting behavior, change, they will migrate or do something to just to adapt.  That might involve infringing on human territory more often.  And at that point who knows what happens to them.  Because while polar bears are impressive, humans won't put up with them invading their spaces for too long.	2	18	60	88
1171	17	What would you think is the best option to fix it?	1	18	137	89
1171	18	It's way too complex a problem to suggest one simple solution.  I personally think that concerns for the polar bears should come way, way down on a list of priorities.  What do you think?	2	18	60	88
1171	19	Im not sure. Do you think this seasonal shift could snowball into a large problem?	1	18	137	89
1171	20	A large problem for whom?  I think this could certainly spell trouble for polar bears.  And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic. But the issue with the polar bears, per se, I don't think resuls in some snowball of destruction.	2	18	60	88
1171	21	It is possible that polar bears population increase after a decrease	1	18	137	89
1171	22	Sure, that's possible.  Lots of things are possible.  I think in the short term, however, the polar bear populations will likely be decreasing, and something about the situation will have to change for the populations to start increasing.	2	18	60	88
1171	23	The shift is strange though. What were your first thoughts on the article	1	18	137	89
1171	24	I just found it interesting and I was curious about learning more about the effects the seasonal shifts are having.  Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.	2	18	60	88
1171	25	Its definitely possible. I think that they could just be eating less also.	1	18	137	89
1171	26	Yes, that's possible.  And I wonder how that changes their behavior, too.  For example, are they hibernating for shorter periods of time?  And how does all this affect pregnancies?  Lots of interesting questions.  It's like a labratory for studying how life adapts and changes in the face of changing environmental conditions.	2	18	60	88
1171	27	The behavior part is interesting. I imagine they may be more resourceful and skilled	1	18	137	89
1171	28	Yes, you either adapt or die.  And species that have been around for thousands and thousands and thousands of years must be pretty adept at adapting or else they wouldn't still be here.	2	18	60	88
1171	29	Good point. They may need a new name if they adapt for warmer climates	1	18	137	89
1171	30	Yes, that's a funny point!  And they may evolve to have a different fur color too if they start heading south, away from the arctic, to find more food.	2	18	60	88
1172	1	Hello	1	18	73	83
1172	2	hellow, how are you?	2	18	138	82
1172	3	Good, but that article was very sad.	1	18	73	83
1172	4	it was sad.	2	18	138	82
1172	5	Every time I read an article like that one, I wonder why more isn't being done.  It's like people don't realize the urgency of the situation.	1	18	73	83
1172	6	What should be done?	2	18	138	82
1172	7	As an example, instead of having all electric cars by 2050, let's do by 2030.	1	18	73	83
1172	8	is that feasible?	2	18	138	82
1172	9	Sure. If the government makes it a priority.	1	18	73	83
1172	10	yeah but it is so hard to get massive things like that done	2	18	138	82
1172	11	I agree but we have no choice, in my opinion. What if climate change continues to get worse... then we have an even more massive thing to fix ... and it might be too late by then.	1	18	73	83
1172	12	if it continues to get worse, we are all in it together	2	18	138	82
1172	13	That's true. I think there is too much focus on the economy and people are afraid to make changes because they're concerned that jobs will go away.  It's the exact opposite ... we'll create more jobs in the area of renewable energy.	1	18	73	83
1172	14	people hate change	2	18	138	82
1172	15	They do.  I even hate change sometimes.  But change is how we got to this place and change is needed to get us out.	1	18	73	83
1172	16	even people who are climate activists don't agree on what to do, that is what makes things so hard	2	18	138	82
1172	17	Well they might not agree on every detail, but they all agree that we're not doing enough and we're moving too slowly.	1	18	73	83
1172	18	yea, it is hard to galvanize people though	2	18	138	82
1172	19	I know.  I sometimes feel like people need to be directly affected by climate change, like having a wildfire in their area, to truly recognize what's happening.	1	18	73	83
1172	20	did the article make you feel anxious?	2	18	138	82
1172	21	I've read a lot of articles about climate change and I feel anxious and worried each time.	1	18	73	83
1172	22	man that's not healthy, take a break, focus on the stuff you can change	2	18	138	82
1172	23	I feel I can change things. Even if it's a small amount.  If every one does sometime small, it will add up to big changes.	1	18	73	83
1172	24	Yea, I don't know. I feel like abstaining from meat for climate reasons, or things like that, only makes the person feel better and has no effect at all.	2	18	138	82
1172	25	I think that people should make the changes they feel they can make. If all they want to do is recycle, then that's it.  I believe it's really the small changes that will make a difference, if everyone does at least one small change.	1	18	73	83
1172	26	ok, I feel like we can't do anything in response to what corporations do	2	18	138	82
1172	27	I don't agree. If we don't like the choice that a corporation made, we should stop buying from them.	1	18	73	83
1172	28	Its impossible to eliminate unethical companies from your consumption	2	18	138	82
1172	29	I think it's challenging, but not impossible	1	18	73	83
1172	30	hm, maybe you are right	2	18	138	82
1173	1	hello, did you read the article about the polar bears?	1	18	107	90
1173	2	Hello. Yes I did. What were the emotions that you took from it and what was your first reaction regarding it?	2	18	61	91
1173	3	It was heartbreaking to hear that they are loosing the ability to survive. my first reaction was, If people need proof that global warming is happing, then read this article	1	18	107	90
1173	4	 That's what I was going to ask you, what you thought the article was more geared towards. I couldn't tell if it was kind of both or was referring mostly to climate change or the polar bears	2	18	61	91
1173	5	Thats what i took from it, was about how global warming is causing the polar bears across the artic to have shorter winters etc. with them loosing about 7 weeks each year or so for the past 35 years. its about a 25% loss over the 35 years of study they done	1	18	107	90
1173	6	 yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?	2	18	61	91
1173	7	I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. 	1	18	107	90
1173	8	that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?	2	18	61	91
1173	9	thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc. 	1	18	107	90
1173	10	 Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time 	2	18	61	91
1173	11	I think what they were referring to was Antarctica. I think there are some small towns and such there. Inuit's mostly probably (guessing)  but as far as countries and what not. i think Africa is close?  Same for me. i need to brush up on locations etc. i know the general area lol.	1	18	107	90
1173	12	 Same here lol I know the area but it's been so long since I was in school but I guess I should be more aware of things like this. But surely since the study was done that they can come up with a plan or are working on one to help the polar bears there's something awful like that does happen or continues to happen I should say	2	18	61	91
1173	13	yeah totally. More then likely they just want to leave them alone and just store data. but as it dwindles down to the last few they will start protecting them in reserves and such im guessing as well lol	1	18	107	90
1173	14	 I hope they wouldn't let them like starve to death or watch them die or something.. somebody's gotta do something about that.	2	18	61	91
1173	15	maybe they will start air dropping food in or something in remote locations where the tribes of the polar bears are. Might just scare them away though	1	18	107	90
1173	16	Hey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food 	2	18	61	91
1173	17	another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol 	1	18	107	90
1173	18	"(i typed ""I see your point too about it might scare away"" my auto correct changed my word to the word ""doubt"" lol sorry) that's a another great point that you bring up about them becoming reliant and staying in the area. Hopefully the researchers come up with something innovative if they can come up with AI which is absolutely incredible in my opinion they should surely be able to come up with something to help this circumstance. "	2	18	61	91
1173	19	Yeah i agree.  With their 35 years of data they have, they should be able to think of something. lol..... On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lol	1	18	107	90
1173	20	lol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? 	2	18	61	91
1173	21	I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can. Overall you want them to still be in their own environment and such	1	18	107	90
1173	22	yes its 30 combined 15 each... Yes we were presented with a small amount of info from the article I probably asked a crazy question lol I was just brainstorming on the idea you had because I thought it was really good about dropping in the food that was really good 	2	18	61	91
1173	23	"yeah i think that might be the best. dropping some sort of food via air drop. wither it be live game they can ""hunt"" still themselves. or some sort of food already cut up for them. some way that can still give them a sense of they are doing it on their own lol"	1	18	107	90
1173	24	Live game that's pretty good right there too. That way they don't become human dependent and don't forget to learn how to hunt 	2	18	61	91
1173	25	"thats kind of the route that i think might be best or more ""natural"" i guess"	1	18	107	90
1173	26	yes I agree. What is that called when animals that are wild become dependent on humans it's not like being team but there's another name for it and I cannot think of what it's called it's right on the tip of my tongue 	2	18	61	91
1173	27	i think i know what your talking about. lol now i cant think of the name either 	1	18	107	90
1173	28	lol that's gonna drive me crazy til i remember lol. It'll be one of those things that come to me at 3 o'clock in the morning when I'm not thinking about it lol 	2	18	61	91
1173	29	haha i know that feeling. might be something i have to end up googling. lol	1	18	107	90
1173	30	me too haha you sound just like me lol	2	18	61	91
1174	1	Hello	1	18	122	86
1174	2	Howdy!	2	18	139	87
1174	3	Were you aware of what was happening to the polar bear population prior to reading this?	1	18	122	86
1174	4	I had known that ice was melting in the polar regions, but I hadn't really thought about how much it might impact polar bears and other animals. What about you?	2	18	139	87
1174	5	Same, I guess I hadn't focused too much on the polar bear population. It's sad to think this is happening.	1	18	122	86
1174	6	Yeah, it is not fun to think that we might be causing issues for the polar bears. It was a bit of an eye opener to make me think about it like that.	2	18	139	87
1174	7	Do you believe climate change is occurring and caused by humans?	1	18	122	86
1174	8	Yeah, I definitely believe that climate change is happening and is primarily caused by humans. I think it's awful how much we are abusing the planet. That's just my feelings on it though.	2	18	139	87
1174	9	I agree, hard to imagine how anyone wouldn't believe that with all of the research that has been done.	1	18	122	86
1174	10	You would think, but lots of people still don't believe it! Maybe if they read the article about the polar bears or saw videos of it they might change their mind.	2	18	139	87
1174	11	What are some of the way you are trying to lessen your impact on global warming?	1	18	122	86
1174	12	I try to minimize the electricity I use. I'll turn lights off when I'm not using them, I keep my home cool in winter, warmer in summer. Things like that.	2	18	139	87
1174	13	I do those things as well. I recently bought a hybrid vehicle as I am not quite sold on full electric yet but I feel good about that.	1	18	122	86
1174	14	Nice! That's definitely a good and large step to take. Hybrids definitely are better for the environment than non-hybrids. The polar bears would thank you :)	2	18	139	87
1174	15	I agree, I am also hoping to get solar panels installed at some point	1	18	122	86
1174	16	That would be good, and could also pay for themselves in the long run. They can make a big impact on reducing your electric bill.	2	18	139	87
1174	17	My electric bills were astronomical this last winter. I hope to offset a lot of that through solar. 	1	18	122	86
1174	18	Smart thinking. Also I should have asked earlier to make sure we got the same article. Was yours about how ice was melting more and the data associated with the research? 	2	18	139	87
1174	19	Yes, that is corect, same article	1	18	122	86
1174	20	"Just checking lol. I was a bit surprised by some of the numbers in it such as how many weeks of ""good ice"" time the polar bears get now."	2	18	139	87
1174	21	I agree, that was surprising. Do you think we will be able to stop or reverse global warming?	1	18	122	86
1174	22	I sure hope so, but I'm not sure. It seems like it might already be too late, but scientific advances are always surprising me. Also as it gets harder and harder to deny it, more money will get invested in research.	2	18	139	87
1174	23	I hope so as well. I get a bit nervous for my kids and society's future when I think about the lasting impacts.	1	18	122	86
1174	24	Hopefully the future will be better for your kids! Using those polar bears and other cute animals might be a good way to get people to pay more attention. It's hard to say no to cute animals.	2	18	139	87
1174	25	Great point, I hope that is a selling point for others! I just can't understand why some people chose to disregard the issue. Unfortunately the government may need to impost stricter guidelines for people like that.	1	18	122	86
1174	26	Gonna be hard to impose stricter guidelines since people who don't believe in it are generally against more government interference. Fingers crossed though they will change their mind.	2	18	139	87
1174	27	That is unfortunately true. I wish everyone could work together for the greater good. That's the only way anyone will win.	1	18	122	86
1174	28	Well I think our conversation is almost over. It's been nice chatting with you and I hope you have a good rest of your day!	2	18	139	87
1174	29	You as well, thank you!	1	18	122	86
1174	30	Bye!	2	18	139	87
1175	1	hi!	1	18	38	85
1175	2	Hello!	2	18	108	84
1175	3	how are you?	1	18	38	85
1175	4	not too bad, yourself?	2	18	108	84
1175	5	same just thinking about what to say about this article	1	18	38	85
1175	6	I can't believe we'll eventually have a world without polar bears	2	18	108	84
1175	7	I really don't either in our life time anyway	1	18	38	85
1175	8	I read today that there are less than 30,000 left in the world	2	18	108	84
1175	9	wow! Thats unreal	1	18	38	85
1175	10	yeah, whats your favorite bear?	2	18	108	84
1175	11	I would have to say a panda ...you?	1	18	38	85
1175	12	either panda or sun bear, theyre so small and derpy	2	18	108	84
1175	13	i dont think I'm familar with a sun bear	1	18	38	85
1175	14	Theyre basically the size of a large cub	2	18	108	84
1175	15	they sound really cool	1	18	38	85
1175	16	On topic of polar bears though they are scary! Thats one of those animals where if you spot it its already too late	2	18	108	84
1175	17	yes i agree..I wish there were more that we could do to prevent this from happening	1	18	38	85
1175	18	Same! I don't really know where to begin though aside from doing ym part to slow down the climate	2	18	108	84
1175	19	Right. I wouldn't know where to start really	1	18	38	85
1175	20	What do you call a bear with no teeth?	2	18	108	84
1175	21	a gummy bear!?	1	18	38	85
1175	22	Yes!	2	18	108	84
1175	23	Haha! That was a good one!	1	18	38	85
1175	24	I wish I could take credit for it haha	2	18	108	84
1175	25	you can on my part	1	18	38	85
1175	26	What do you call a wet bear?	2	18	108	84
1175	27	hmmm.... what?	1	18	38	85
1175	28	A drizzly bear!	2	18	108	84
1175	29	hahahaha... Awesome..Love it!	1	18	38	85
1175	30	I think we're about done?	2	18	108	84
1179	1	I was disappointed with what I read, but not really surprised by it.	1	18	140	93
1179	2	Hello how are doing today?	2	18	65	92
1179	3	I'm doing well and yourself?	1	18	140	93
1179	4	I am well too. 	2	18	65	92
1179	5	So in regards to the article, I was highly disappointed with what is happening, but hardly surprised by it	1	18	140	93
1179	6	What did you read about? mine was about the arctic ice melting earlier this year and polar bears losing their homes 	2	18	65	92
1179	7	Yeah that is the one that I read.  I'm just disappointed that we, as humans, have let it get so bad, to clarify my disappointment	1	18	140	93
1179	8	yeah me too I think that we are solely responsible 	2	18	65	92
1179	9	I agree.  It seems more natural disasters and more species going extinct and it's so incredibly sad that it seems those in power, who could actually help, don't care	1	18	140	93
1179	10	especially the big companies that are polluting the environment 	2	18	65	92
1179	11	Yeah :(  they have far too much power in politics since they can buy the politicians.  The bigger companies make billions and get angry if they have to pay more in taxes so instead of making, say 5 billion, they may only make 4.8b	1	18	140	93
1179	12	it is so unfair for everyone affected especially the animals	2	18	65	92
1179	13	Exactly, the ones who can't speak or defend themselves	1	18	140	93
1179	14	apart from sadness, what other emotions did you get while reading the article?	2	18	65	92
1179	15	Definitely anger as well as anxiety.  Melting icecaps raise ocean levels which can affect coastal areas	1	18	140	93
1179	16	same here. I only wish there was something I could do to help	2	18	65	92
1179	17	Same here, I also fear for what my kids will be left with in the future.  How about you?	1	18	140	93
1179	18	Yes I worry about the world the future generations are going to live in 	2	18	65	92
1179	19	Yeah.  I do hope that we can change things both for the polar bears and the world in general before it is too late for anyone	1	18	140	93
1179	20	me too. change needs to happen 	2	18	65	92
1179	21	I'm sure there are little things we can do to help, but as we said earlier, it's those bigger polluters that need to do the bulk of the work	1	18	140	93
1179	22	can you give me an example of things one can do?	2	18	65	92
1179	23	I would say we can put pressure on the worst offenders.  Boycotts and (peaceful) protests.  Call them out and hope that they take it to heart.  As an individual we can recycle more, walk/bike or car share to cut carbon emissions	1	18	140	93
1179	24	that could work. 	2	18	65	92
1179	25	I think it would have to take a concerted effort by many people in order for it to start making a difference	1	18	140	93
1179	26	thats true. what was your first reaction while reading the article?	2	18	65	92
1179	27	Definitely anger, but sadness was right up there with it.  What were your feelings?	1	18	140	93
1179	28	I wasn't surprised but I felt pity for the animals 	2	18	65	92
1179	29	Exactly.  Is it sad that we're not even surprised by this?  :(	1	18	140	93
1179	30	yeah I have been following the climate change quite closely  	2	18	65	92
1183	1	hello, my first reaction to the article was to feel angry	1	19	143	95
1183	2	yeah me too	2	19	49	94
1183	3	I don't like hearing about abuse happening to children	1	19	143	95
1183	4	he had a rough life	2	19	49	94
1183	5	yeah, and nobody really protected him	1	19	143	95
1183	6	why those assholes adopted him i don't know	2	19	49	94
1183	7	or how an adoption agency let people like that adopt him	1	19	143	95
1183	8	yes exactly	2	19	49	94
1183	9	seems like there are problems with adoption in this country because it happened twice	1	19	143	95
1183	10	i don't get how he still wasn't a citizen	2	19	49	94
1183	11	adoption should be to provide a better life, not abuse	1	19	143	95
1183	12	i wonder what happened to the parents	2	19	49	94
1183	13	i wondered too. I didn't know that being adopted by us citizens didn't automatically make you a citizen	1	19	143	95
1183	14	that makes no sense	2	19	49	94
1183	15	I agree, it should be to prevent from happening to anyone else	1	19	143	95
1183	16	and what about his kids	2	19	49	94
1183	17	exactly, poor kids will lose their dad	1	19	143	95
1183	18	are they citizens?	2	19	49	94
1183	19	oh true, that makes no sense either if not since they were born here	1	19	143	95
1183	20	i just hope they fix it and get him back	2	19	49	94
1183	21	me too, hopefully someone is fighting for him	1	19	143	95
1183	22	hopefully the articles brings awareness	2	19	49	94
1183	23	maybe a movement will be started to pass some new adoption laws	1	19	143	95
1183	24	yes and politicians that care	2	19	49	94
1183	25	yes if we could find some that would be nice	1	19	143	95
1183	26	"i wonder if south korea would consider him a ""citizen"""	2	19	49	94
1183	27	maybe because he was born there, but I don't know much about their government or laws	1	19	143	95
1183	28	hopefully we get updates about him	2	19	49	94
1183	29	and his wife, that's a lot for a mom to deal with	1	19	143	95
1183	30	yeah she will need help	2	19	49	94
1184	1	Hi, are you there?	1	19	144	97
1184	2	Yes, what did you think of the article?	2	19	145	96
1184	3	It's bad and unfair	1	19	144	97
1184	4	I agree. Sometimes I think we do things like that because we want to feel that we are better than others.	2	19	145	96
1184	5	It was most perplexing that they didn't even sign the boy up for his citizenship, as if they already knew that they wanted to mistreat him.	1	19	144	97
1184	6	Yes, I felt that that was a part of the abuse. I have a problem dealing with the abuse of children.  I have seen the results.	2	19	145	96
1184	7	Yeah, a lot of people don't like it. I think it's heinous because kids can't protect themselves and they need others to do so. And also, that the most vulnerable part of a person's life.	1	19	144	97
1184	8	Yeah, and when the system failed him, he got into trouble. He gets turned around, and the system attacks him again. We've lost what little compassion we had.	2	19	145	96
1184	9	I got a lot of respect for the adopted parents that treat their kids well.	1	19	144	97
1184	10	Yes. One of my nephews has 2 adopted and two of their own. They would correct me at once and tell me they have 4 kids.	2	19	145	96
1184	11	Haha, wow! That's good to hear that they treat them all well :D	1	19	144	97
1184	12	Yeah, he's a good kid that came from a tough upbringing. I've always been very proud of him and his wife.	2	19	145	96
1184	13	They are people to be proud of :D I hope that the man in the story can come back over and be with his family - if the story is real. Sometimes they use fake stories, but it still is something to get mad at -_-	1	19	144	97
1184	14	Yeah, I live in Texas and have seen similar things happen quite a bit. It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. 	2	19	145	96
1184	15	That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.	1	19	144	97
1184	16	No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities. We have deported people who served in the military when it turned out that they weren't really citizens.	2	19	145	96
1184	17	What?! That is crazy!	1	19	144	97
1184	18	Sure, dreamers who have been here nearly their entire lives who wanted to serve their country. Sad and ridiculous.	2	19	145	96
1184	19	They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.	1	19	144	97
1184	20	The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people. When I read about the man in the article all I saw was us punishing someone who was trying to do the right thing. The thing is that most of the people around here are all for that sort of behavior.	2	19	145	96
1184	21	I wouldn't be surprised. Many people in America are oppressors. Even some of the oppressed go on to oppress people who are more vulnerable than them. I feel sad for them going through such things.	1	19	144	97
1184	22	Yeah, it seems like a lot of us need someone to hate.	2	19	145	96
1184	23	That type of personality is so lazy - taking the easy way out. The regrets later are going to hit them like a ton of bricks.	1	19	144	97
1184	24	Maybe, but a lot of them are so convinced that they are right that I doubt their conscious will ever bother them. 	2	19	145	96
1184	25	Aww, I don't like the thought of that. I was about to say someone must have told them they are doing wrong, but then they surround themselves with people who tell them that they are doing right. It's disheartening. I wonder what makes some people aware and while others are not.	1	19	144	97
1184	26	I think that people get in echo chambers with others who feel the same way they do, and they convince each other that they are right and the rest of the world is wrong. It would be funny if it didn't hurt others so much..	2	19	145	96
1184	27	Oh, yeah. And if no physical person is there, they can go online where there is bound to be some people who agrees with them.	1	19	144	97
1184	28	YouTube too. One of my friends got me to look at a video about 9/11. For the next month everything I got in my feed was a conspiracy theory, one crazier than the other. No wonder people are scared.	2	19	145	96
1184	29	Oh, those conspiracy theories are very weird! On was about the moon landing being faked. I like astronomy and they had my curiosity piqued.	1	19	144	97
1184	30	The scary thing is that the more facts you give them that show they are wrong, the more convinced they are that they are right.	2	19	145	96
1190	1	Hi	1	19	149	99
1190	2	Hey	2	19	130	98
1190	3	How are you doing?	1	19	149	99
1190	4	I'm pretty good. How about you?	2	19	130	98
1190	5	Not bad.   So, what did you think about the article on Adam Crapser?   I feel very sympathetic for him as I don't believe that he is responsible for his situation.	1	19	149	99
1190	6	It's horrible. I feel like an exception should be made in his case. It wasn't his fault.	2	19	130	98
1190	7	There were obvious mistakes made during the adoption process when he was a child.  He should not be punished for those mistakes.	1	19	149	99
1190	8	No, he shouldn't. And to make matters worse, his family is going to suffer.	2	19	130	98
1190	9	I agree.   Deporting him rips his family apart and causes everyone to suffer.	1	19	149	99
1190	10	And all for what was essentially a paperwork error. Given the life he lived up to that point with the abuse he suffered, it's hard to not feel sorry for him.	2	19	130	98
1190	11	This case was a few years ago.  Do you know what eventually transpired?	1	19	149	99
1190	12	Supposedly there was a bill that was being debated in Congress. I don't know if it passed, but I think it might've been too late for Crapser anyway. 	2	19	130	98
1190	13	Yeah.  Looks that way.  I think that he was eventually deported.   Too bad the case didn't get more media attention at the time it was happening.	1	19	149	99
1190	14	Yeah, it might've caused congress to solve the immigration problem once and for all. A missed opportunity and now more will suffer.	2	19	130	98
1190	15	It's even worse because his kids are really young and at the age where they need a father presence in their lives.	1	19	149	99
1190	16	Yeah, it just wasn't worth causing kids to grow up in a broken home to deport this man.	2	19	130	98
1190	17	"I believe that there were a lot of ""hidden"" issues in the adoption system back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.   I don't think a lot of changes were made until issues were identified starting in the 1980s."	1	19	149	99
1190	18	It's probably still broken. I hope no other family has to go through this. Just no excuse for it. Hopefully Crapser found a way to get back to his family.	2	19	130	98
1190	19	I just feel sad and angry that we, as a nation, allowed his situation to get to that point.	1	19	149	99
1190	20	People don't pay too much attention to issues, which is the problem. If it doesn't affect them personally, they don't care.	2	19	130	98
1190	21	I just wish that a politician in his state had championed his situation and tried to prevent the deportation.	1	19	149	99
1190	22	Yeah, they probably could've gotten a lot of advertising and fundraising out of it. It would've been a win-win.	2	19	130	98
1190	23	Also, most of this transpired during the Obama administration.   The Trump administration became even more hardline on deportations.	1	19	149	99
1190	24	I think some deportations should have exemptions made for them. A lot shouldn't be eligible like unauthorized border-crossings, but this was a unique situation.	2	19	130	98
1190	25	The other sad fact is that Adam was deported to South Korea but he has no idea how to speak Korean.	1	19	149	99
1190	26	That's horrible. It must be scary being deported to a country you've never known and you can't even speak the language there.	2	19	130	98
1190	27	Yep.   It's like being thrust into an environment that you have had no exposure to.   The whole cycle of trauma now passes down to another generation.	1	19	149	99
1190	28	Nobody should ever have to go through what Crapser did. I hope he's doing better these days.	2	19	130	98
1190	29	I hope that someone read about his case and was willing to support him and his family financially or to even relocate them to a third country.   Canada has always seemed very open to refugees?	1	19	149	99
1190	30	Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe someone could start a crowdfund for him.	2	19	130	98
1192	1	Good morning, how are you? My name is Sol	1	6	65	1
1192	2	Hello. good morning	2	6	45	0
1192	3	I read the article and it is tragic, the way civilians are disposable.	1	6	65	1
1192	4	Yes i have read the article this article is aliban attacked 	2	6	45	0
1192	5	Also conditions like that are breeding grounds for terrorism, people in the general public need to pay more attention,	1	6	65	1
1192	6	Yes correct people is very altered to this condition	2	6	45	0
1192	7	It seems that when tragedies like these happen, people just 'tune it out' becuase it feels so far away.	1	6	65	1
1192	8	Taliban hased strong attack so people are tune out	2	6	45	0
1192	9	I wonder how regular people like us can help or bring attention afghanistan and the humanotarian crisis there	1	6	65	1
1192	10	talibans has violated womens and girls rights to education, work and free movement	2	6	45	0
1192	11	Exactly, do you think elected officials here in the us care anymore about afghanistan?	1	6	65	1
1192	12	Yes officers and many countries feel the taliban people	2	6	45	0
1192	13	How can we bring more attentnion to the civilians and their needs? Are you reading my questions and comments?	1	6	65	1
1192	14	Yes. provided the many helps to provide the peoples	2	6	45	0
1192	15	 Do you think politics gets too injected in humanitarian issues?	1	6	65	1
1192	16	Humanitarian is complex emergenices are injected to the political	2	6	45	0
1192	17	 How would you help the civilian's plight?	1	6	65	1
1192	18	provided the money and food	2	6	45	0
1192	19	 do you think contacting your congressperson would bring attention to the Afganistan humanitarian crisis?	1	6	65	1
1192	20	Some attention to this person	2	6	45	0
1192	21	I am no aware of any international charities to help war-torn countries, how about you?	1	6	65	1
1192	22	peace direct is the internal charity to stop the war	2	6	45	0
1192	23	Maybe a change.org campaing would raise awareness. Tell me one thing about yourself, pls. I think you either are a AI or English is not your primary langiage? It's OK, i just would like to know. :)	1	6	65	1
1192	24	yes english is my primary language	2	6	45	0
1192	25	Do you think awareness and bringing awareness to this issue would have any impact to the people suffeirng?	1	6	65	1
1192	26	it can mobilize the power of public opinion in support of an issue and thereby influence the political will be decision maker	2	6	45	0
1192	27	" Ok have a good day, thanks for the interaction. I asked you a question if you thought contacting elected official would have an impact, and you answered ""Some attention to this person"", that made no sense and was not an answer. SO what did u mean byu that?"	1	6	65	1
1192	28	Sorry my mistake	2	6	45	0
1192	29	I would think being so low effort with answers and avoiding any real discussion would make it faster, but this was the longest one yet! Have a good one. Bye.	1	6	65	1
1192	30	Okay	2	6	45	0
1193	1	Hi	1	6	46	60
1193	2	Hi, how are you?	2	6	52	61
1193	3	Good, thanks	1	6	46	60
1193	4	So have you done some of these HITs before, I think they have been going on for about 1.5 weeks	2	6	52	61
1193	5	I recall doing one before. Have you done one? 	1	6	46	60
1193	6	yes, what I don't like is that there is no time frame to the article to know how old the information is	2	6	52	61
1193	7	Yes, a frame of time would be useful. However, I think even without that information we could still discuss the article. Have you read it already?	1	6	46	60
1193	8	yes, the whole Afghanistan war helping then withdrawing an not much progress is concerning	2	6	52	61
1193	9	Yes, there was a quick withdrawal. The article cites the withdrawal of combat troops around 2014. It doesn't seem like it has been that long already which was surprising to me.	1	6	46	60
1193	10	I agree it felt like it was more recent.  Of course it has been a long ongoing war, maybe the Nato forces withdrew earlier and the US stayed longer.	2	6	52	61
1193	11	You are correct, this is specifically pertaining to NATO. Still, I feel that NATO and the US left very quickly. What was your first reaction about the article?	1	6	46	60
1193	12	Anytime there is death of families not soldiers is concerning and friendly fire is the saddest as well, you think how could this be prevented 	2	6	52	61
1193	13	That's how I felt immediately too. Within that first sentence the words Afghan and killed appeared together. Even after all these years of war it still is saddening.	1	6	46	60
1193	14	yes and the Taliban is ruthless, not mention but something I pay attention to now is how the Taliban is treating women, very different than they said they would	2	6	52	61
1193	15	Yes, there was a bit of progress made and there seemed like some hope but when the Taliban took back over and girls couldn't even go to school it was like all of that progress was nullified.	1	6	46	60
1193	16	yes it very sad for them.  I found another article that indicates they found a series of failures that resulted in an attack on a Doctors without borders hospital in Kunduz in 2015	2	6	52	61
1193	17	Yes, the article discusses this. They (DWB) declared it a war crime. There has to be more accountability. I don't understand how something like that can happen. Someone must have gave the go ahead for the strike and deemed the risks acceptable. They should be held accountable.	1	6	46	60
1193	18	here is what I found: According to officials, no criminal charges were filed and the service members received administrative punishments in connection with the U.S. airstrike in the northern city of Kunduz.  A number of those punished are U.S. special operations forces.	2	6	52	61
1193	19	I wonder what administrative punishments entail. I can understand not revealing identities of US SFO but that is not enough accountability. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.	1	6	46	60
1193	20	you would think with drone technology that a hospital would not be targeted	2	6	52	61
1193	21	Yes, they have drones now that can surveil the interiors of buildings. If they aren't sure than they shouldn't be taking risks that endanger the lives of innocent people. Punishment should fall on the head of the chain of command. I bet you that they would quickly find the person at fault if higher ups were held to be accountable.	1	6	46	60
1193	22	Apparently it was a very big attack: On 3 October 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship attacked the Kunduz Trauma Centre operated by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) in the city of Kunduz, in the province of the same name in northern Afghanistan.[3][4][5][6][7][8] 42 people were killed[2] and over 30 were injured. Médecins Sans Frontières condemned the incident, calling it a deliberate breach of international humanitarian law and a war crime. It further stated that all warring parties had been notified about the hospital and its operations well in advance	2	6	52	61
1193	23	Yes, that is an unacceptable number of civilian casualties. Even one is too much, but this level of destruction and death is intolerable. It is difficult not to agree with the statements from Doctors Without Borders.	1	6	46	60
1193	24	Yes and you wonder how the intel could have been so wrong that a USAF gunship would target that sight	2	6	52	61
1193	25	Yes, somebody is responsible for that wrong intel and I am curious how it happened. It's happened before so I don't know how they can let it happen again.	1	6	46	60
1193	26	another part of the article talks about the mission was to assist, advise and train Afghan defense, how that mission relates to an out and out bombing is disturbing, I wonder if Afghan's were also involved	2	6	52	61
1193	27	If I was one of the family members it wouldn't matter who was involved. I would care about justice. 	1	6	46	60
1193	28	True, which was probably why they were parading them through the streets.	2	6	52	61
1193	29	I can't imagine living through that. I don't know what I would do personally if it happened to me. It's almost impossible to imagine.	1	6	46	60
1193	30	yes, it could have been targeted misinformation by the Taliban that led to this, I once worked in the military for a division that wrote unconventional warfare plans and there were planned psych ops for that very reason	2	6	52	61
1196	1	hello?  What was your first reaction from it?	1	6	49	62
1196	2	I was horrified by the tragedy that occurred in Kunduz province. What about you?	2	6	51	63
1196	3	Yeah, terribly. I think I heard about this some years ago, though.	1	6	49	62
1196	4	The news of civilian deaths and the loss of American soldiers is alarming and unsettling	2	6	51	63
1196	5	Yes. It surely is. I think these military members have to de-personalize the situations	1	6	49	62
1196	6	Agreed, I feel a sense of frustration and disappointment that such a tragic event could occur again	2	6	51	63
1196	7	Is this an AI driven HIT?	1	6	49	62
1196	8	I think some of them can be	2	6	51	63
1196	9	No, I mean this right here. Are you a bot?	1	6	49	62
1196	10	No I am not, are you?	2	6	51	63
1196	11	Nope. I don't have much else to say about these civilian strikes. I get the impression that these were drone strikes	1	6	49	62
1196	12	It is possible that the airstrikes were carried out by manned aircraft or drones	2	6	51	63
1196	13	Yep, I guess so. War is hell.	1	6	49	62
1196	14	What emotions did you get from the article?	2	6	51	63
1196	15	I feel very sad about the losses. It seems that much of this could have been avoided.	1	6	49	62
1196	16	It would be nice if it could have been avoided but it is clear that the situation in Afghanistan remains challenging, with ongoing conflict and the risk of civilian casualties	2	6	51	63
1196	17	"Right. Did you read the book by Sebastian Junger called ""War""?"	1	6	49	62
1196	18	I haven't, what is that about?	2	6	51	63
1196	19	He (the author) documents some of the perils going on in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan	1	6	49	62
1196	20	I haven't  heardabout what is going on there	2	6	51	63
1196	21	This is back when the USA was heavily involved- like around 2007	1	6	49	62
1196	22	Why was the USA involved in the first place? to stop russia from taking over the region?	2	6	51	63
1196	23	I don't really recall.	1	6	49	62
1196	24	thats what ive always thought but i dont really know too much about history	2	6	51	63
1196	25	Well, went to that area post 9-11 in the interest of self-defense against Al-Qaeda	1	6	49	62
1196	26	oh right, around 2007 that would make sense, i guess i was thinking about before 9/11	2	6	51	63
1196	27	Right. The Junger book was interesting. The author spent some time over there himself- to get a better story (I guess)	1	6	49	62
1196	28	what was the most interesting thing you read from that book?	2	6	51	63
1196	29	I think there was a section in there when the author barely avoided some gunfire. I think I did a hard skim on it, so I don't really recall in great detail.	1	6	49	62
1196	30	Well that's not too surprising for whats going on over there, but I bet it is quite the story	2	6	51	63
1198	1	hi	1	7	68	65
1198	2	Hello, how are you?	2	7	67	64
1198	3	good	1	7	68	65
1198	4	good! have you read the article?	2	7	67	64
1198	5	yes	1	7	68	65
1198	6	any first reaction(s)?	2	7	67	64
1198	7	nothing	1	7	68	65
1198	8	what did you think about the article	2	7	67	64
1198	9	At least three U.S. military trainers in Jordan were fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base, Jordanian and U.S. officials said	1	7	68	65
1198	10	yes, that's very unfortuante	2	7	67	64
1198	11	very sad	1	7	68	65
1198	12	nothing good will come out of wars	2	7	67	64
1198	13	yes	1	7	68	65
1198	14	I wonder if this was an accident or intentional	2	7	67	64
1198	15	I think it was intentional	1	7	68	65
1198	16	it seems like the driver refused to stop for some reason	2	7	67	64
1198	17	yes	1	7	68	65
1199	1	Hai	1	7	58	66
1199	2	Hi, what did you think about the incident?  I thought it was sad and strange	2	7	60	67
1199	3	I read the article and it is tragic, the way civilians are disposable.	1	7	58	66
1199	4	I thought it was strange how the US troops not only failed to stop at the checkpoint, but then even exchanged gunfire with the Jordanians.  They must have been very confused or doing something very bad.	2	7	60	67
1199	5	yes you are correct	1	7	58	66
1199	6	I hope the family members of these dead servicemen get some answers about what happened, although it's possible that the answers they get aren't very satisfying.	2	7	60	67
1199	7	yes Also conditions like that are breeding grounds for terrorism, people in the general public need to pay more attention,	1	7	58	66
1199	8	Yes, I think that even if accidental and unfortunate deaths occur in situations like this, these people are still fighting for a good cause.  Unfortuantely, bad things happen in war and dealing with things like terrorism, but they're sort of necessary evils to prevent a lot more people from dying or suffering.	2	7	60	67
1199	9	It seems that when tragedies like these happen, people just 'tune it out' becuase it feels so far away.	1	7	58	66
1199	10	Yes, although I would say that it's unreasonable to think that people can, or should, take seriously and personally every piece of news they come across.  We're exposed to too much news nowadays.  The world has gotten too big.  You have to tune a lot of it out because it'll drive you crazy otherwise.  Most of it doesn't really affect us anyway.	2	7	60	67
1199	11	 wonder how regular people like us can help or bring attention afghanistan and the humanotarian crisis there	1	7	58	66
1199	12	I think that type of thing isn't our responsibility.  If you feel it is, there are lots of organizations who probably already do work there.	2	7	60	67
1199	13	ok i understand	1	7	58	66
1199	14	I think one can vote for people who have a visioin of how to deal with these issues.  There are people who think we should be actively engaged in these problems, and people who think we should just ignore them, that they aren' our country's problem.  One can always vote for the person they think will push for their vision of America's invovlement of these things.  I just want us to keep destroying terrorism, wherever it is.	2	7	60	67
1199	15	Exactly, do you think elected officials here in the us care anymore about afghanistan?	1	7	58	66
1199	16	No, I don't.  I think they cut and ran because it was unpopular with the voters.  I think all these people are cowards, but hey, that's how our so-called democracy works.	2	7	60	67
1199	17	Yes absolutly correct. i appricate you	1	7	58	66
1199	18	Thank you.  I appreciate you, too.  What other emotions did the article make you feel?  I guess I also felt pretty impotent, and frustrated that these challenges exist all over the world and I'm not sure we're making much progress.	2	7	60	67
1199	19	I read the article and it is tragic, the way civilians are disposable.	1	7	58	66
1199	20	Yes, there's lots of death and destruction all over the world.  And oftentimes civilians are the casualties.  I hope the civilians realize they have a part to play though.  If you allow terrorism to take hold in your country, you suffer the consequences one way or another.  These civilians have a responsibility for the state of their own country, I believe.	2	7	60	67
1199	21	How can we bring more attentnion to the civilians and their needs? Are you reading my questions and comments?	1	7	58	66
1199	22	I am most definitely reading your questions and comments.  If you want to bring more attention to this issue, I think you should find an organization that's trying to do something about it and volunteer to help them raise money, help, or advocate for these civilians.	2	7	60	67
1199	23	How would you help the civilian's plight?	1	7	58	66
1199	24	I would keep fighting the terrorists and showing the civilians that there's a simple choice to be made here.  You either stop putting up with terrorism in your country and actively seek a stable, peaceful nation, or you continue to deal with chaos and war.  Those are the choices.  I think the civilians ultimately have to decide what type of country they want to live in and to fight for it, just like Americans did in the Revolutionary War, and innumerable other wars.	2	7	60	67
1199	25	I am no aware of any international charities to help war-torn countries, how about you?	1	7	58	66
1199	26	I'm not completely sure, but I know Doctors Without Borders does work in war-torn countries, and Amnesty International probably does, too.  I'm sure there are many that do.  You just have to do an online search.	2	7	60	67
1199	27	Do you think awareness and bringing awareness to this issue would have any impact to the people suffeirng?	1	7	58	66
1199	28	"No.  I don't.  I think ""awareness"" allows weak-minded people to placate themselves and believe they've done something to help a cause.  It's just something people talk about so they don't feel guilty."	2	7	60	67
1199	29	good you are great and  i have chat with great person in this day. 	1	7	58	66
1199	30	Thank you.  I've enjoyed chatting with you too.	2	7	60	67
1202	1	Hello!	1	7	49	68
1202	2	Hi there!	2	7	56	69
1202	3	So what do you think about the article?	1	7	49	68
1202	4	Depressing to say the least, you?	2	7	56	69
1202	5	ooh yeah definitely. I also feel frustrated at the incident as well. 	1	7	49	68
1202	6	Absolutely, so pointless	2	7	56	69
1202	7	Lives are lost just like that. I really hate wars/war zones	1	7	49	68
1202	8	Same, I will never understand it	2	7	56	69
1202	9	In this specific case, I wonder what happened that made the US military people ignored the demand to stop at the gate. Was it some kind of misundersanding, accident or was it intentional? hmm	1	7	49	68
1202	10	"Yeah those ""accidents"" sure seem to happen a lot "	2	7	56	69
1202	11	I applaud the effort and bravery of everyone who's in the front line. I probably would get PTSD the first day there	1	7	49	68
1202	12	So would I! I can't even imagine being in that	2	7	56	69
1202	13	I feel for the family members too!! . Do you have any family members in the military?	1	7	49	68
1202	14	Only grandparents that are long gone, you?	2	7	56	69
1202	15	Not that I know of, pheww	1	7	49	68
1202	16	Did you notice all the question marks in the article?	2	7	56	69
1202	17	Yes, they might be some kind of symbols that get messed up when copy pasted to the mTurk HIT? I have no idea what they mean	1	7	49	68
1202	18	Ok just making sure i'm not having a stroke lol	2	7	56	69
1202	19	haha, I've seen it in the other articles as well by GEM. This article at least didn't involve innocent civilians	1	7	49	68
1202	20	True, its sad that thats almost refreshing	2	7	56	69
1202	21	Yeah, I was going to say that not that I was downplaying the death of military trainers in this article, and then I realized that I had to wait for your turn once I hit ENTER	1	7	49	68
1202	22	I have to say I think 15 messages is a bit excessive haha	2	7	56	69
1202	23	yeah, I think emotions/reactions from an article like this would almost defintiely involve depressing, frustrations, anger, saddening, grief, unnecessary deaths. I am not sure what else can come out of reading an article like this. JOYY??!	1	7	49	68
1202	24	Haha, exactly! Yay tragedy!	2	7	56	69
1202	25	I secretly wish that the US would pull out of the middle east and stop whatever they have been doing there for decades though	1	7	49	68
1202	26	I agree completely! What a waste of lives	2	7	56	69
1202	27	absolutely, and a waste of taxpayer money as well	1	7	49	68
1202	28	That too! I feel like so many of the younger people that end up in the military are being duped	2	7	56	69
1202	29	and get all these PTSD or whatever side effects that come with it	1	7	49	68
1202	30	Absolutely, well I think we are about done nice chatting with you	2	7	56	69
1205	1	Hello, my name is Sol. How are you?	1	8	70	18
1205	2	Hey Sol, I'm doing great. My name is Chico, how are you?	2	8	78	19
1205	3	Good Chico, that's a cool name! 	1	8	70	18
1205	4	Thanks! So do you have any thoughts on the article about the immigrants dying?	2	8	78	19
1205	5	I read the article and it is tragic, how people can lose their lives searching for something so SAVE their very life	1	8	70	18
1205	6	I agree. It really put it into perspective when they compared the figures to the chances of being killed in the US by guns.	2	8	78	19
1205	7	yes,  also it seems that when tragedies like these happen, people tend to blame the vicmis	1	8	70	18
1205	8	That's true, If I was in their position, I'd take the same risks they are taking.	2	8	78	19
1205	9	for sure,  do you think elected officials care about immigrant's well-being here and/or abroad?	1	8	70	18
1205	10	I think they do, but they also realize that it's an expensive problem, an unpopular problem and a problem with no easy answers.	2	8	78	19
1205	11	Do you think politics gets too injected in humanitarian issues?	1	8	70	18
1205	12	Not really, it is a political issue on many levels. What do you think?	2	8	78	19
1205	13	Some issues are political in nature, but massive loss of life shoule not be regarded as political. It is humanitarian. You had a grat point of immigration here in the US, how do you think people feel about tragedies within the immigrant community here in the US?	1	8	70	18
1205	14	Most people are conflicted. Of course they empathize with those affected, but what is the right way to help? What happens when that help comes at the expense of helping others who already live in the country. Resources are finite.	2	8	78	19
1205	15	I am reminded of efforts back in the 80s to help the famine in Africa, people were ready to help. Even those in the entertainment industry, it was abut helping those in need.	1	8	70	18
1205	16	But the problems are still ongoing 40 years later. The real change needs to be made in the political environments in the countries the refugees are fleeing from. 	2	8	78	19
1205	17	Do you think awareness and bringing awareness human suffering has any impact on helping them?	1	8	70	18
1205	18	I hope it helps their cause, but at some point people become immune to the tragic images. What do you think is the #1 thing governments like the US should be doing?	2	8	78	19
1205	19	That's a tough quetion, the US is influenced so much by money that I don't think Syria is in any way important to the government at all	1	8	70	18
1205	20	But, we all feel bad for the refugees and want to help them. What's the effective way to do so?	2	8	78	19
1205	21	Throwing money at issues like these is the easy way out, it is a very tought situation.	1	8	70	18
1205	22	I know, I feel bad that there is no easy answer. I'd love to tackle the root problem, which are the corrupt governments in many countries, like Syria.	2	8	78	19
1205	23	exactly.  Maybe a change.org campaing would raise awareness so people can contact their elected officials? I don't know, it would be a start/	1	8	70	18
1205	24	I don't have any answers. I'll probably just continue to feel bad but not do much about it.	2	8	78	19
1205	25	How would you help the civilian's plight?	1	8	70	18
1205	26	I think the only long term effective solution is regime change. But that has to come from within their own countries. I am against foreign intervention.	2	8	78	19
1205	27	Good discussion, so tell me something about you Chico? Where are you from?	1	8	70	18
1205	28	I am from the US, where are you from?	2	8	78	19
1205	29	Me too, im in AZ and you?	1	8	70	18
1205	30	I'm in Florida, a state that rivals Arizona in terms of craziness.	2	8	78	19
