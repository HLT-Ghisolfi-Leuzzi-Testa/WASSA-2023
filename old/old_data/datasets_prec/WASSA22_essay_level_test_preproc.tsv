Whether it's a tame ride or not, the company needs to make sure that all of their rides are held to the highest standard in safety. I am hoping that tourists will boycott Dreamworld until they can find a way to ensure that all of its rides are safe for families.It was not a simple malfunction. This is the failure of Dreamworld to protect the interests of their customers.	1.0	5.0	1.0	40.0	25000.0	3.7037037037037033	5.555555555555555	4.62962962962963	4.62962962962963	4.62962962962963	2.7777777777777777	0	4.015746695378273	3.7736385345918433

It's definitely not cost effective but I guess they could construct really tall fences around the turbines. Or maybe there's a technology solution with lasers or something.

Still, if some women to chose a C-section because they want to avoid the pain, I think that is a bit selfish on their part and they should have decided to endure that when they engaged in activity that could get them pregnant. Birth should happen the natural way when possible because the child benefits from it by being exposed to essential bacteria for their immune system from the mother’s birth canal and probably in other ways as well that may not be known yet.

Just a heads up but I hope you give it a go.	2.0	5.0	1.0	30.0	42000.0	2.0	0.0	1.0	7.0	3.0	2.0	0	4.572432015565384	4.127514907324691

I did not really enjoy reading this article because I felt that it was too emotional. I do not like anything that talks about situations like this. It makes me very uneasy because I have two children of my own and cannot even begin to imagine what this man had to be thinking. The article is a little graphic, but other than that it is a good read.

We are not doing enough and this article goes into how Australia had the hottest summer on record in 2013. Things are getting worse year by year and we are not doing much to change our carbon footprint.

I would have to do more research to determine if the killing was justified, morally speaking, as I'm sure there are reasons that some populations of wild animals must be culled.	1.0	7.0	5.0	41.0	64000.0	7.017543859649123	2.6315789473684212	6.140350877192983	4.385964912280702	8.771929824561404	5.2631578947368425	0	3.751373396251989	3.483018731568283

I was super anxious about it and felt really inadequate as a human. I'd like to strongly encourage you not to feel the same way. When it comes time for you to get married don't let anyone, including yourself, make you feel bad about who you are on a day that should be all about celebrating your happiness.

It was a phenomenal rental price - more than $20,000.   Can you imagine?   Anyone, they both are in a terrible disagreement and lawsuit.   The leasee is stating there are many problems with the apartment that were never corrected by the lessor.  The owner of the apartment is claiming the now tenant making up items in order to cause breach of contract.   He has no grounds to do that with so each are suing each other.   It will be interesting to see how this is resolved.

There was a student named Montravious Thomas who was 13 years of age attending Muscogee School System in Atlanta.   Apparently the teacher, Mosley, attacked the student and body slammed him three times.  Thomas now has lost his leg because of it.   So horrific!!! On top of this horror, Thomas was told they called the ambulance but later we find out they did not.    Then they made Thomas try to ride the bus.   They then carried him onto the bus.

I found it confusing to read and honestly did not understand some of it.  Since you are an attorney, are militias legal in US.   I researched some and could not find the answer.  The constitution refers to our President as having command of militia in certain states.   Our constitution is always quoted by the militia.   It seems they were accused of keeping people from work but the militia says no.    A person was killed and so many other inhuman happenings.   It was very upset after reading it.  I do not understand in the year of 2019, we still continue to have so many atrocities against human beings.   Is the above correct at all?  I need some comfort at this very difficult time.

R_21hvez526gzveuE_3	R_21hvez526gzveuE	173	Hey X, it's Y again. Just wanted to follow up with more communication about my feelings after having read an article. Mosquitoes are responsible for preventable deaths. What else is new, I know, right? It's Zika this time, a little better than Malaria I imagine, but I can't say for sure having never experienced either. Supposedly there are measures which could prevent much of the problems through immunization, but we both know how receptive the world is to medicine these days.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0	4.938271604938271	4.938271604938271	8.641975308641975	3.7037037037037033	7.4074074074074066	3.7037037037037033	0	5.393415462602345	5.037621352003185
R_21hvez526gzveuE_4	R_21hvez526gzveuE	255	Another day, another deadly fight. Nothing ever seems to change. Sometimes I wonder if humanity will survive in the long run. Sometimes I wonder if we even deserve to survive in the long run. Look at what we do to this planet and to each other. For centuries animals existed in relative peace. At least they would consume their victims for nutrition.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0	12.903225806451614	4.838709677419355	11.290322580645162	11.290322580645162	9.67741935483871	6.451612903225807	0	7.222012629385359	7.027259336691629
R_21hvez526gzveuE_5	R_21hvez526gzveuE	368	Another day, another travesty.  Relative travesty at least. Not that I want to downplay sexual assault, but where is the media's outcry for the atrocities that occur every day, which put this to shame? Are they only concerned because the headlines sell? Are the journalists even making efforts to cover more pressing topics? At what will we just stop feeding our never ending desire to feed off the misery of others? Put down the fucking phone and go do some good for the world.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0	9.523809523809524	8.333333333333334	15.476190476190476	2.380952380952381	13.095238095238095	4.761904761904762	0	4.910476076644084	5.107745911453386
R_1gShpZuf35KXreS_1	R_1gShpZuf35KXreS	73	Hey, I've always liked Billy Bob Thornton and kind of related to the guy. He's very low key for his fame, like I'm pretty sure I would be a lot like him if I were to ever get famous. Angelina definitely strikes me as an extrovert, though. Like, okay, I often think that YOU push me outside my realm of comfort with social activity, but to be homebody-introvert Billy Bob Thornton tagging along behind the whirlwind that is Angelina seems like a hyperbole kind of comparison in that....you're not so bad. Love you!	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	6.451612903225806	4.301075268817204	8.602150537634408	17.204301075268816	4.301075268817204	1.075268817204301	0	4.5266440176212	4.026538430634063

Dude would rather buy Greenland with taxpayer money to strip it for resources than preserve the environment. I just don't know how we have such an ignorant man-child as president. Still! I've been waiting to wake up from this dream for years and it just won't happen.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	9.375	6.25	4.6875	10.9375	9.375	6.25	0	6.578977868328587	6.665930602913355

That poor baby... I'm pretty sure my day is ruined. Thank goodness for Mr. O'Dell's humanity in that situation. I probably would have crumpled up in devastation, I love kitties so much.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	11.666666666666668	6.666666666666667	13.333333333333334	20.0	15.0	8.333333333333334	0	7.672432796335954	7.5349968985704034
R_1gShpZuf35KXreS_4	R_1gShpZuf35KXreS	260	I don't know anything outside of this article about the King and Queen of Thailand, but I feel like this is what happened with my mammom and poppop when they died. My mammom got sick and died and not even a month later my poppop went too. I think when you're with someone for so long, and suddenly you're not... I mean, I don't believe in much, but love is very powerful. Extending my sympathies to the people of Thailand.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	6.25	8.75	8.75	7.5	10.0	7.5	0	5.642903277990185	5.164720172540332
R_1gShpZuf35KXreS_5	R_1gShpZuf35KXreS	358	Honestly, this man is the epitome of everything that is wrong with - not just America - the world. Like this is the kind of BS that sets us back DECADES in civil rights and general American ignorance. It's infuriating and I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE this clown is the president. I hope that the black community comes out in droves to angrily vote against this SOB in the next election, like show him what's what.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	5.333333333333333	2.6666666666666665	2.6666666666666665	16.0	8.0	8.0	0	5.573141457896461	5.590090079830314
