I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	3.5	5.5	38	2	6	1	35	148000	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	1	train	0	Hope/Sadness	143	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.07894736842105263	0.1	2.6967456371753937	2.8464004363228184	"This is a very heartbreaking article.

187	299	I honestly find this article more amusing than anything.  I absolutely loathe birds.  Can't stand them.  Want them all dead.  I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

They go to another country and expect to be accommodated.  A country and government's first priority should be to its own people.  These other people have no inherent rights to be taken care of or even allowed to enter the country.  We exist in a world of borders and law--for the better.  These people come from countries that are hellholes they must flee, and they are complicit in that.  How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me.  They have no right to that.

470	326	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

318	39	I think it's pretty sad that the wolf got killed. I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise.

418	301	The whole drug topic really makes me sad as I had a mother who I saw unravel from being addicted to pain killers. I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.

374	367	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.

378	91	I just read this horrifying article. I am actually not sure that I should even tell you about it because it was so disturbing. It was about this woman who was on the Dr. Phil show. When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it.

71	3	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim.

353	116	This is just crazy that people are still dying today when there is medicine that can easily save there lives. There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

243	19	I don't feel empathy for the refugees, who are complicit in corruption and worthless systems of government that lead to their need to flee.  Nor do I think they have any right to do what they're doing.  And every country has every right to keep them out and let them deal with their own situation in their own country.  But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.  How disgusted would I be if I were a German citizen and Merkel said Germany would take in one million refugees.  Why not just hand the country over to Syria and these other craphole places and we'll go live on their sand piles?

306	48	I was not connected to anyone after reading the article on Aleppo and the horrible circumstances that the elderly face after the destruction wrought on the city. I was told by the System to enter the code after the survey so I completed the survey and answered with all neutral answers. The instructions said that I would get paid if I somehow was not connected with anyone (i.e. if they disconnected). I guess in this situation they did in fact disconnect. I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so. War tears cities apart, and it is hard for me to understand how so many innocent people suffer due to the whims of those in power. I hope to get paid for my efforts.

123	6	"I think this article brought up some good points about how lack of empathy in our society has become a crisis, and it needs to become a focus of our society to increase the level of empathy that people have for one another. Large swaths of society have fallen under the ""just world"" fallacy and think people deserve what they get, somehow through whatever choices they made, and then accordingly believe that it couldn't possibly happen to them because they wouldn't make these choices. That makes it easy for them to dismiss those upsetting situations and not show any caring for those suffering. These attitudes need to be combatted.
