They said the people of ISIS just dumped there bodies as if they were trash.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143

Today, i heard, he died at age 83 due to lukemia.  IT is very sad to lose such a well respected actor.  I guess his parents divorced at a young age but both gave him the genes to act.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143

Today I read about a lady who passed away November 6th and had shared many of her stories of her experiences in the holocaust.  IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143

The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through.

This man, a wealthy Hong Kong banker, murdered two young women in his apartment in a gruesome and sadistic fashion. He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment. He slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase.	disgust	1	2	5	29	26000	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714

I mean I know you're a big gold fan, so I understand how this is upsetting you. I will send you more articles about him later on today so we can talk more about him. What do you think? Who do you think was better? Jack or Arnold? What about tiger? Either way, I hope you get this article and it helps lift your spirits a bit.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857

I had heard about the lack of water supply in California but I hadn't heard anything at all about the suffering in Nevada also.  It seems that lots of Nevadians, especially the Native Americans who own land there are in trouble from the lack of water.  With everything dying, it is difficult for them to keep animals alive.  Is it also causing problems in families. Who would think that lack of water would be the cause of violence, abuse, and neglect.

The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714

Cancer really does humble the soul into new places that one never thought possible to emerge stronger from feeling. It sounds like she faced it with a mask of strength at first. After time, the real emotions came through where she realized the strength was not in being stoic but admitting how tough it really is to experience.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits. I hope that men will earn more fair wages in the future.	surprise	1	4	1	34	42000	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.0	4.857	2.714	4.857	5.0

This is tearing my heart out and I can't get the images of what must have happened out of my mind.  You know that I was in the military myself and it makes it that much harder on me.  I can't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel.  From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.  It's so sad.  It's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the enemy, but when they get taken down by friendly fire?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857

I feel like recycling and people having knowlegde about these plastics and polluting our environment are everywhere for Americans to see.i just kind of wonder the countries that had the highest percent of plastic in their oceans do they educate or inform those countries like america does?

They ought to throw the book at him.	disgust	1	7	1	64	145000	7.0	6.5	1.5	6.5	7.0	3.571	1.286	3.571	4.0

The people weren't even from Oregon. They traveled half way across the country, invaded the facility, and barricaded themselves inside. Yet the jury didn't find reasonable cause to believe they impeded Wildlife Service workers from doing their jobs. Bunch of alt-right would-be cowboys.	anger	1	7	1	64	145000	7.0	6.5	1.5	6.5	7.0	3.571	1.286	3.571	4.0

She's on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated. What's to investigate? The dog didn't lock itself in the car. She should at least be immediately fired for being too stupid to be a cop.	anger	1	7	1	64	145000	7.0	6.5	1.5	6.5	7.0	3.571	1.286	3.571	4.0

It seems like these things are becoming more common. At least the reporting of such accidents is more common. People should pay more attention to their driving. I wouldn't be surprised at all if someone involved was distracted by cellphone use.	sadness	1	7	1	64	145000	7.0	6.5	1.5	6.5	7.0	3.571	1.286	3.571	4.0

I am deeply sorry for the families of the innocent civilians that were killed but our United States army has to do what it has to do in order to protect our great country and keep us all safe as Americans.

Its saving the government but that would probably be the only smart move hes made since hes been in the white house period. Im not a Trump supporter but I like the idea that he chose to save the government money.	joy	2	6	4	25	26000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	4.428999999999999	5.0

I can't even imagine how this is going to affect the local wildlife. They should be funding environmental groups to help the local animals in any way possible. This is going to have far reaching consequences too, as the poisoned fish and birds will affect other species and they'll end up effecting us as well. I wish there was some way to avoid these terrible accidents.	fear	1	4	1	29	25000	3.0	3.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	2.714	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0

The odds of HIV infection are so low that these blood donation laws need to be rolled back, like in Argentina. In the short term though, a way to help would be organizing a blood drive so those victims will get all the blood they need.	neutral	1	4	1	29	25000	3.0	3.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	2.714	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0

It sounds like he shot his relative for sure though. Even though he maybe didn't kill the husband of the woman he had an affair with, one murder should potentially be enough for the death penalty.	joy	1	4	1	29	25000	3.0	3.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	2.714	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0
