I'm assuming they just broke in and then used tear gas on the couple? How did they escape from the masked men? Or did the masked guys just steal stuff and then leave? I'm not sure what the gun laws in France are but these reports would make me feel uneasy there.	fear	1	4	1	29	25000	3.0	3.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	2.714	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0

The problem is, there is nowhere to go.  There are a few camps for refugees but not nearly enough space.  People are even taking there sheep which can’t be helpful…  The IS has had people under their rule for almost 3 years and the people are making a run from it.  No doubt they have every reason – the young women and girls feel veil-less freedom!  The IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  The were right to leave as the city is now a war zone with Iraqi security forces retaking the city.  It is a bitter fight with the usual “blood will spill” messages rampant.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person.

The country is barely a step above a third world country in most parts, while the rich get richer and Putin profits.

I can't imagine what it's like to leave the house every day not knowing if you will come back, or of living in fear of letting your children leave the house to go to school because they might not make it home.

The economic crisis that is happening there is not only affecting people, but also the animals that live there. Especially in the zoos. We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos. Many animals have suffered for weeks.	sadness	1	4	1	25	50000	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857

Wiseman cited irreconcilable differences. His docs state both he and Kate have waived any right to spousal support, and that suggests there's a prenup. They were married in 2004 and have no kids together. TMZ broke the story ... the couple's marriage was on the rocks last November. Len was spotted out with model CJ Franco, and Kate we seen shortly after -- sans wedding ring -- on the red carpet.	neutral	2	5	3	25	20000	5.0	4.5	3.5	2.5	5.0	3.0	2.857	2.857	3.143

Initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and attention this situation is creating. I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point. As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase.

The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with.

After a 24-hour chase the police found the criminal and even though the victims have not been recognized, they will soon discover who they are.	fear	1	5	1	23	53000	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714

To my Republican friends who support this candidate I just have a few opinions of my own.  First I would say Issa never receded his support for Trump after the Infamous Hollywood Access recording.  For somebody who preach's morals its kind of hypocritical.  Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests. He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection. This guy has no morals and should not be supported for his constant flip flopping."	neutral	1	4	1	31	125000	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	3.429	3.286	3.857

Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.	sadness	2	6	5	33	51000	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429

Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay.

The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp.

Do I think Kim by posting the pics made someone want to rob her? No, but I think it's probably best to be more modest about what you post. I mean, just for safeties sake. I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed. Yes, I'm sure everything is insured, but it's still a scary experience and I'd do everything I could to avoid it.	fear	2	4	3	33	60000	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857

It was about how kids see ads for junk food when they go online. They also spend a lot of time online, especially on YouTube. The videos on there are more influential, since they are real people, and the ads are more convincing. The article made me not want to let the kids watch YouTube or go online, which is really hard to do.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down. It may be our best shot. We could only be so lucky.	fear	2	6	1	59	25500	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143

Well, it certainly is concerning to me! The report, released this month, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand supposedly the hub of the global Fairtrade system. I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply. Well, knowing how you love your coffee just as much as I do, I just knew this would fascinate you! Tell everyone!!	fear	2	3	1	32	30000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	3.0	4.571000000000001	4.428999999999999
