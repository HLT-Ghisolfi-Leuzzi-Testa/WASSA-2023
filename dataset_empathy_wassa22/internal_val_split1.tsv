This particular story hit closer to home because it focused on a specific person and her family. I can't imagine being roused from my bed to hear that my child has been the victim of a terrorist attack at a show. The whole thing sounds terrible.

According to the article he attempted to put a band-aid on deeply rooted relationship issues by taking the family to Disney Land. Who thinks like that? Honestly, I can see taking any available route when desperate, but if your wife wants to leave you she is going to leave you.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1	7	1	47	54000	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857

Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0

What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

I also think the United States should update its policy of using airstrikes. It seems to me that more civilians are being killed than the people who are being targeted.  I feel sorry for the people in Yemen who just want to live a normal life and can not because of the war.	Sadness	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	372.0	30.0	1.0	train	371.0

Within the frame of the story it just does not make sense but i feel so bad to the owner for having to lose her friend like that. Absolutely sad.

On the one hand, it's crazy that people would do this, but on the other hand, I'm not exactly surprised. Trump has been inciting racial hatred and tearing down standards of decent behaviour since before the beginning of his campaign.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.

I know that bigots are not a particularly new species, but I used to think, just a few years ago, that things were much better and that people were generally becoming more open-minded and welcoming. But the election of our new president signals something very different. And very much encourages the bigots to spread their wings and parade proudly. They are being empowered right now, and that is very disturbing.	disgust	2	6	1	57	135000	7.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.857	1.571	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001

It seems like it's the richest people in the world that always find some excuse either not to pay taxes or not to pay someone money that is owed.
