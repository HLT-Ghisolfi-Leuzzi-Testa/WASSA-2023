And obviously the authorities, who do nothing and allow this to go on.  But what about the families who keep having children they feel obligated to send to work at age 11 and 12?  Stop having children you can't feed.  These countries are all grossly overpopulated but they keep having kids.  The parents feel bad that their kids got treated this way, but they're the ones who sent them there.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife.

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2	4	1	33	60000	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0

I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.	surprise	1	6	1	32	50000	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429
