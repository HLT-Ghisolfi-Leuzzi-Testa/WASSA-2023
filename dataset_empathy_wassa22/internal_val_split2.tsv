Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999

All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here. Let them try living back in Africa and see how they like that.	anger	2	2	1	63	35000	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0

There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.
