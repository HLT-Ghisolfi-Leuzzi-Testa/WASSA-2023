1.0	2.25	I always wonder whether to believe articles like this.  I have always liked Mayweather, and I feel there are probably two sides to this story. Besides, the lawsuit is filed but there is no verdict yet, so Mayweather could be innocent.  Anyone can file a lawsuit and the only proof of who is right is when the suit is decided.  I will be interested to follow the outcome of this one.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	65.0	34500.0	6.5	4.0	1.5	6.0	6.5	4.2860000000000005	1.429	4.714	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	71	586	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.1	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.15	0.15	0.0	0.0	2.6093864713606103	2.5200216597219733	low	low	An essay written by a 65.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 34500.0$.

May God give the parents the fortitude to bear the lose. ANd may he also provide another kid for them immediately. There should be ways by which the parents can be consoled.	sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	28.0	165000.0	6.25	5.75	3.25	6.75	6.0	3.357	2.429	3.2145	3.4285	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	68	1722	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.811821831696484	2.713817751850383	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000.0$.

I believe that elephants are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. To keep one in isolation is pure cruelty. I have seen elephants cry over the lost of loved ones and they are very communal animals. 	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	69	2024	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.9791528837514254	2.9094611841965983	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

3.667	2.75	It's very unfortunate for both the wildlife and the communities that survive off of the meat that the rare animals provide. It's also sad how the police officers ran away which was I guess the main point of the person telling the story. That is very corrupt and wrong, they should have stood up for the Rangers being targeted. I think it's best if the wildlife is preserved and the community that attacked the Rangers were clearly out of line.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	480	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.706523654784907	2.598670371424574	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

1.5	1.875	I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday. A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.  Hopefully the truth is discovered and people can be content with the tragic event.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	1771	0.125	0.075	0.025	0.125	0.075	0.125	0.225	0.125	0.05	0.05	0.0526315789473684	2.5693970936654065	2.436672076148976	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I wish people would donate more and that restaurants could donate their unused food to homeless shelters.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	15	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.0	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.0	3.0611905715665784	2.9260388707459817	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

4.0	3.375	"A few thoughts about this.  First, amazing how far down the car accident death statistics are.  That's amazing.  Second, I find it interesting that 2007 is when young suicides spike.  That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.

1.5	1.0	This is undeniably a tragic situation, and I am hopeful that remedial measures will be pursued. The suffering endured by the innocent wildlife is truly heartbreaking. It is imperative for the government to intensify its efforts to rectify or, at the very least, enhance the current state of affairs. While I understand the constraints posed by resource availability, it may be possible to discover small-scale endeavors that can bring about a positive change. The precarious state of the ecosystem emphasizes the urgency for swift action on behalf of the defenseless animals who find themselves as helpless victims in this situation.	hope/sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	100	2220	0.2121212121212121	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.1818181818181818	0.2121212121212121	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.0454545454545454	2.7129654110352748	2.7281214035499515	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

5.0	3.125	This article resonates strongly with me, as it introduces a perspective I wholeheartedly endorse. It hadn't occurred to me before how locations like zzos and theme parks can be teeming with young individuals who should not be exposed to smoking. I believe that treating cigarettes similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is not allowed, is a sensible approach. When children observe others smoking, they perceive it as the norm and acceptable behavior. Shielding this generation from such influences can empower them to make better choices in the future and lead healthier lives. By implementing this proposed ban, we have a genuine opportunity to decrease the number of potential new smokers and eliminate the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am fully supportive of this ban and see no negative repercussions from its enforcement.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	135	2267	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.4074074074074074	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	2.601544240108423	2.6075093429763534	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

3.833	1.25	Wow, I just read an article describing the problems Venezuela is having with its new leader.  About 80% of the people are dissatisfied with his leadership and want him out.  But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.  The article made comparisons with Cuba, and previous leadership, but I did not fine a clear solution.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	40000.0	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	114	667	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.664979211588646	2.4560975066976654	low	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I feel bad for this woman who felt a need to lie about her status of citizenship to stay in a country just to continue living a better life.  This is the second time she has been arrested which shows me that she is really trying to escape a war ravaged country and to continue on living a better life. They should let the girl go.

The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	sadness	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	73	50	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.3571428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.570467739636896	2.441225217124561	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

7.0	7.0	The government of India makes a lot of money from coal production, but they do not take into account who this is affecting the most. Both the people and the elephants are being hit the hardest, not to mention the forests that are being destroyed. There have been 75 deaths of people and 30 deaths of elephants. People are having respiratory problems. Just imagine the children being affected. It's a travesty. People need clean air and water to live and it's like the government doesn't care.

I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

It is quite bad but these things happen.	neutral	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	57	1934	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.217391304347826	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.5595606176407184	2.512945326195652	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

Please remember to clean up your trash, do not litter, and do not leave items out that will potentially hurt animals when you are visiting an area.

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?

6.0	6.0	I empathize deeply with the victims and their families. They were simply carrying out their duties when this unfortunate explosion, resulting from negligence, tragically claimed their lives. It is disheartening that despite being aware of the hazardous and insecure working conditions, no action has been taken to shut down these facilities. While I appreciate the closure of approximately 1,000 establishments, I believe more needs to be accomplished. It is crucial to establish a governing body and implement regulations similar to OSHA in the US, ensuring the protection of workers and the implementation of all necessary precautions to safeguard human life. Currently, families are left bereft of their beloved sons, fathers, and sources of income, when a simple closure could have prevented this loss. I fervently hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	133	2206	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0408163265306122	0.2244897959183673	0.1836734693877551	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1020408163265306	0.0357142857142857	3.0012886178493576	2.916732470700339	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	anger/neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	134	2151	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.1707317073170731	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there.

Halloween is a time to have responsible fun and some guy took it to the extremes. It's sad, and I feel for those parents.

I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

They are nothing but innocent civilians but they have to be the ones that suffer the wrath of war and issues in the government. it's terrifying to not know where your home is and sleep whereever you can. These people are basically just wandering around hoping they can find a safe place.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	67	1749	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.9393959651211814	2.8157924052546504	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

2.333333333333333	2.75	The entire scenario is distressing. It's deeply unsettling that there are individuals with such twisted minds who would perpetrate such atrocious acts. It gives me a sense of the world being a terrifying and dreadful location. I find it difficult to express my thoughts beyond this. I sincerely hope that justice prevails and these individuals are held accountable for their actions. Such incidents should never occur, and my heart goes out to the victims and their families affected by this tragedy.	fear/hope	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	81	2269	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0666666666666666	2.853488064373801	2.855833893406585	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article really hits home for me as my father was a smoker. I am so grateful he choose to smoke outside and never around us kids. I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	2017	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0434782608695652	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.5	5.25	Another article I read showing a death of African American driver by a police. I really upset me reading this article. That unnecessary force was used to handle the situation. Its crazy that the first thing on the police mind is to shoot to kill. I feel uneasy every time seeing and reading about situation like this where a situation could of been handled in a different way.

1.833	1.25	Did you hear about the 3 year old that climbed into the gorilla enclosure and was dragged around by the gorilla. The zookeepers had to shoot the gorilla. Apparently, there were no problems with the barrier. I'd like to know how the little boy got in there. Based on what I read, I don't really take issue with the zoo or the gorilla. The barrier was at the right standard, and the gorilla did what a gorilla is going to do if something like that happens. I place the blame on the parents who somehow let their 3 year old child climb into a gorilla enclosure.
