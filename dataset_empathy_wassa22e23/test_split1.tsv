The leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to guilt you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while majority of this money goes towards these non-profit organizations that help them push thier agenda. These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal.

3.167	4.0	Hey,  I think you should be careful around the Canonsburg area next time you visit Pennsylvania. The crime has been increasingly more dangerous within the past few years. According to this article that I read online, a police officer was shot to death and another police officer was injured in an ambush. I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	24.0	55000.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	829	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1458333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.91722408565792	2.8410753633042187	medium	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

After reading the whole article, I believe that the other husband has the right to sue the authorities for not saving the his husband after he fell off. In any case, whether the person was guilty of previous crimes, he or she should be saved or this would have been seen as sketchy work by the police officers.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	24.0	55000.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	80	830	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.2272727272727272	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.700306429474278	2.72388067544528	low	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

The only hope is that he doesnt start a nuclear war and that he will eventually be tried and brought to justice for his numerous crimes.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	48.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	3.857	1.0	4.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	109	846	0.1176470588235294	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.2058823529411764	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.1470588235294117	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.088235294117647	0.0476190476190476	2.77756036687727	2.8494142359333883	low	low	An essay written by a 48.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The ruling class has a stranglehold on the wealth and the average person gets next to nothing.  The country is barely a step above a third world country in most parts, while the rich get richer and Putin profits.

Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way. I can't imagine another reason than that.

This kind of thing has been going on forever ,,, my whole life and I have to admit that I am becoming immune to these types of stories and lost all empathy for these people. Normally you would read a story such as this and be heartbroken for the women and children who lost their lives but there is a story (or 2 or 3 or 10) like this every day and for decades and no end in sight. So just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered. Herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your concious.

I am happy that many different options are available: not all involving colon cleansing (e.g. X-rays), that there is a dietary advice to minimize the discomfort (which food to eat before the procedure), etc. So, the person’s quality of life, their well-being in the short term is taken seriously into account.	joy	2.0	7.0	1.0	45.0	120000.0	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	91	879	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.3125	0.09375	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.1	2.9894988919189727	2.864918305833841	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000.0$.

The situation with the immigrants from Mexico and the idea of building a southern border wall is upsetting to me. President Trump policy and views are disruptive to the whole economy of Mexico, causes political tension and instability, not to mention the extreme uncertainty in the lives of Mexican immigrants in USA, who already have hard lives here.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	45.0	120000.0	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	880	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.857723459138977	2.853202579557582	low	medium	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000.0$.

4.333	3.75	Global warming is real. The effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us. The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	36.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	162	881	0.1578947368421052	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0263157894736842	0.0303030303030303	3.074889281869577	2.774841346826427	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

2.5	3.25	"So I just had to read this article for a survey. It was completely unformatted, an enormous text-wall essay list. I made it all the way through though. I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot. I think that's kinda weird that something like that was even included in an article with feminist tone."	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	27.0	15000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	139	897	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.4117647058823529	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0357142857142857	2.482067050265856	2.2223396177554178	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

3.667	5.75	"I had to read another article with zero formatting for a survey. This one was about war in the Middle East. It was pretty depressing to read. Religion makes people do such horrible, hateful, stupid things. Apparently kids just pick up explosives, people get their heads blown off, little girls die for no reason. For what? Because someone's imaginary friend in the sky is slightly different from their imaginary friend in the sky? Ridiculous, disgusting. Imagine what these people could have accomplished if they dedicated themselves to knowledge instead. We could be on other planets, we could live for thousands of years or more. But nope, we'd rather hate and murder each other of something as stupid as ""God"" or ""Allah."""	disgust	2.0	5.0	1.0	27.0	15000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	121	898	0.1372549019607843	0.0980392156862745	0.0196078431372549	0.0588235294117647	0.0196078431372549	0.1764705882352941	0.196078431372549	0.0980392156862745	0.1176470588235294	0.0784313725490196	0.0416666666666666	2.597733692235733	2.633733678820026	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

3.833	5.125	So, in India there's a lot of corruption and the Prime Minister made a promise to stop it. He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

2.0	2.5	If you hear a ringing in your occasionally, don't be too alarmed. If you hear it persistently for quite some time, I would be slightly worried and definitely more alarmed. This could mean that you eventually lose your hearing. Tinnitus is a common thing to experience and usually is nothing. But sometimes this can be an early sign that you could lose your hearing. I strongly encourage people to go and get this checked if they experience frequently and definitely educate yourself on it.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	84	914	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.925540185694296	2.7364630801939853	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Just read an article about bananas, the kind you buy in a supermarket, which are apparently called Cavendish bananas and are expressly considered ""commercial"". Apparently, commercial bananas are under threat due to their lack of genetic diversity, making them prone to fungal diseases -- another variation, ""Big Mike"", went the way of the buffalo in the 60s for the same reason. I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning.

But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop.

Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results.

4.5	2.0	This article was quite interesting to me. It talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive. It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects.

First I would say Issa never receded his support for Trump after the Infamous Hollywood Access recording.  For somebody who preach's morals its kind of hypocritical.  Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests. He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection. This guy has no morals and should not be supported for his constant flip flopping."	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	125000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	3.429	3.286	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	108	963	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.0689655172413793	0.2758620689655172	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0	2.449754519757445	2.384394773479629	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 125000.0$.

Attacks of terror and mass shooting are mostly causes by angry white men. When It's a white man hes a lone wolf and when your from a foreign country its terrorism. I am not making excuses for what happened. Surly its tragic but lets not pool a whole race of people into a negative basket because of one or two bad eggs.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	125000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	3.429	3.286	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	93	964	0.1794871794871795	0.1282051282051282	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.0	0.1025641025641025	0.2564102564102564	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0	2.823366768507651	3.011182425256224	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 125000.0$.

As you move forward, life will remove many people from your life just because they aren't required and you can actually reach your destination. Your life has just begun, nobody stops moving, the sun still rises and the sun still sets.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	78097.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.5	3.714	3.286	3.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	101	981	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2142857142857142	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0416666666666666	2.9607182020337874	2.916355490838252	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 78097.0$.

3.667	3.875	What this also taught me is that I think poverty teaches you to value anything and everything you have .. importance of friends , importance of one time meal, importance of tiniest thing in your life .. It teaches you to survive on bare minimum. Poverty teaches gratitude.  Some of the most happy people in the world are those people who have the least.

I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.

Farm attacks and -murders which see journalists having to write these reports with words I cannot even begin to imagine the sickening feeling of. Words like “boiling water poured down 87-year-old farmer’s throat for hours on end,” and “his wife and two teenage daughters were tied with barbed wire in the bathroom, after which they were repeatedly raped, burned with a hot iron, and stabbed with a sharp object.”	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	32.0	25000.0	4.0	4.5	5.5	3.5	3.0	4.2860000000000005	3.143	3.143	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	106	1015	0.0869565217391304	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.05	3.191009327605028	3.1492519261341827	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

Now, every person and company is its own media brand - and there are significantly less barriers to reaching people.his has allowed smaller brands to gain a foothold in the market much easier. When we see trends like craft beer, food trucks, and local fashion, that is often the result of harnessing social media platforms to build a following in a cost effective way.  Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons. We seriously need to do something about these conditions.	anger	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	1021	0.1304347826086956	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1	2.887471641540525	2.935960670048317	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

That's right, I just read this article detailing the struggles currently going on with coffee crop farmers. There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going. The warm temperatures have really threw a wrench into their day to day operations and maintaining the coffee crops has become quite a challenge. We are in danger of either paying really high prices on coffee or worse case scenario being without coffee period. This is very distressing for me.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	132	1023	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases.

I think a huge problem here is gun laws and there should definitely be some sort of change that occurs.	neutral	2.0	6.0	5.0	24.0	22000.0	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	97	1029	0.25	0.1875	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.876774411004067	2.8899811535568065	low	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

Yes, they know the risk involved, but because of other countries bombing their land out they are trying to find a better and safer situation for themselves and for their families. I don't blame them trying to better themselves from the war-torn countries that they come from.

I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	155	1072	0.0357142857142857	0.0178571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.0178571428571428	0.25	0.1607142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.125	0.0	3.012018933955341	2.864087843745476	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.0	2.25	Reading this article makes me upset. I hate what we do to native people. It seems as a society we seem to ignore their feelings and traditions just to move ourselves forward. We forget that we intruded onto their land to make ourselves homes that we enjoy yet we can't offer them the same good feeling. To even think that the option of having dangerous amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me.	anger	2.0	6.0	5.0	33.0	51000.0	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	1081	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	2.9533733377217177	2.913727935388549	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation.

I think that people are constanstly always trying to come up with reasons as to what is happening with the earth, but these people are trying to pick this ladys research apart.

People get harassed way to often in the workplace with nothing being done.	surprise	2.0	5.0	6.0	31.0	62000.0	6.0	4.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.857	2.714	3.571	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	1098	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1	2.834909180475798	2.78118156698582	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

Being that our Country is held highly among-st the rest of the world, you would think that we would be considered with the environment just as much as everyone else. How can he believe Climate Change isn't real How is he allowed to just pull us from this deal we agreed to? It seems pretty stupid to me that he can just make these changes on his own free will.

I have never worked at a bank before, but being told to reach a quota, even by the means of doing illegal tasks to accomplish what they needed to do. I can't imagine coming into working everyday and wondering if I was going to be considered a good or a bad employee. It would infuriate me to have earned a bonus and then be told I cannot have it because I am being developed as an employee. I am glad they decided to make the change.

The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp.

Moore also says Democrats must fire the pundits, pollsters, and members of the media who refused to let go of a narrative about the election that proved to be incorrect, force aside any Democratic members of Congress who aren't ready to fight, and remind everyone they meet that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. His No. 4 item, however, might come as a surprise to Democrats who are posting their own status updates on social media about how ""shocked"" or ""stunned"" they are at this outco"	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	100.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	2.857	3.571	3.714	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	138	1114	0.1851851851851851	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.074074074074074	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.0	2.3920783487579222	2.310396959267564	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100.0$.

But despite efforts from aid organizations like ours, there are still 2.2 million people living in unreachable areas in northeast Nigeria, with no contact to the outside world ― and no guarantee of safe passage for aid workers. We don’t yet know the full extent of the crisis ― the Nigerian military and humanitarian organizations like Mercy Corps are still trying to push into these parts of the country ― but based on what we’ve seen so far, we fear the worst. “The carnage becomes more glaring as we gain access to newer areas, and it has become a struggle for those of us in the forefront to comprehend how to help the thousands we come across who need our support,” said Michael Mu’azu, our humanita	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	100.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	2.857	3.571	3.714	2.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	1115	0.119047619047619	0.119047619047619	0.0476190476190476	0.119047619047619	0.0476190476190476	0.238095238095238	0.1666666666666666	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0714285714285714	0.0333333333333333	3.117542304759964	2.967699431594227	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100.0$.

The result of American ignorance will mean a great deal of pain in many lives, including those of our next-door neighbor. I wish we valued experts more such that we could introduce policies that help all people--which is quite possible. Diplomacy and politics are not a zero-sum game: there are no enemies unless we create them. All people have value and choosing knee-jerk hate will only harm us in the long run.	anger	2.0	6.0	3.0	32.0	85000.0	5.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	3.0	4.143	3.0	4.857	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1116	0.1515151515151515	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0666666666666666	2.977106056004017	2.87882082806496	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

Their time should be spent on non-criminals.  But if they believe the police are the ones who handed them over to a drug cartel, then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	89	1121	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.95893284074278	2.974448426322971	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too.

2.333	4.0	I'm no parent and I completely believe Donald Trump is a horrible man. With that being said, I don't think it is correct to shun your child from having a different belief as you. Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me. It worries me that the child will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for fear of upsetting their parent.	disgust	2.0	6.0	3.0	28.0	35000.0	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1131	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.0	0.1891891891891892	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.0	2.707699326919287	2.745124841783209	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

I think that the Mayor of Sacramento is blessed that's all that happened to him. Yes he may be upset and a little shaken, but he still gets to go home to his family and enjoy his wealth. He doesn't lose his job and he isn't majorly damaged.

I say stupid because ignorance is simply not having a lack of intelligence or something, but you're still willing to educate yourself or be educated on it.

Really don't think of foreign investments in ethipoia but I guess there is.	neutral	1.0	7.0	1.0	39.0	76000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.429	4.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	62	1147	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.2222222222222222	2.3436423019246653	2.197783703755245	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000.0$.

I also feel liek their are too many people just trying to make a quick few bucks, theyll do anything and everything to get there way. I feel bad for some of the less fortuanate consumers who have to be tricked into paying these ridulous high prices foroil.	joy	2.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	25600.0	5.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	5.5	5.0	4.2860000000000005	3.143	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	76	1165	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	2.914298015205535	2.725072900261246	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 25600.0$.

7.0	7.0	A perfect example of greed and selfishness-British government is willing to kill innocent creatures in order to drill for oil, regardless of consequences! Instead of exploring other alternatives, such as natural energy sources, they will go and march their way to Africa and claim innocent lives just to put money in their pockets. I wonder if the majesty Queen, the mighty Queen of England, would appreciate of someone suddenly marched into her palace and started drilling for oil?!!! Absolutely disturbing-total disregard for nature and living creatures, nothing but pure greed regardless of the cost!	disgust	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1166	0.0857142857142857	0.1142857142857142	0.0571428571428571	0.1714285714285714	0.0571428571428571	0.2	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.0476190476190476	2.877824993844638	2.85906604492951	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.

Apparently we need to cultivate more varieties, so we do not face another crisis like Cavendish and Big Mike bananas that have succumbed to a fungal disease and almost got wiped out. We are so used to seeing bananas as a common fruit at supermarkets that we never think of not ever eating another one again! I found this article very intriguing, there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to protect this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more resistant to various dangerous fungal strains.Apparently this presents a great challenge for the scientists but they are hoping to cultivate more banana plant varieties that will be more resistant to various illness.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	1167	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1212121212121212	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.0	2.997666666169005	3.0083669187454567	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.

7.0	7.0	While I do sympathize with the plight of back people and latest police violence, I think that they are not helping the situation by engaging in violent protests that take even more lives and create a great deal of disturbance in USA! These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals! They need to be psychologically stable and clear of racial bias, otherwise they are not suitable for this job!	anger	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	129	1168	0.1052631578947368	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.1403508771929824	0.0701754385964912	0.2105263157894736	0.1228070175438596	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.0701754385964912	0.0714285714285714	3.186521112139404	3.1287676426196693	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.

They should be punished accordingly, a dark cell with a toilet and a meal of prison mush twice a day would serve them just right.

3.333	3.375	Just came across an article that involves shootings and people being killed. The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	37500.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	125	1171	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1351351351351351	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6932243424568827	2.65952896669124	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 37500.0$.

4.167	4.875	I just read on a news paper about a situation in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka about their water situations. They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

Afghanistan went through bad conditions in the last three decades but in the new government of HAMID KARZAI from 2000 it's started developing again many reconstruction and other works can be seen.It's going to take a lot of work though.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	56000.0	3.0	3.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	3.286	2.286	3.429	3.286	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	59	1180	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0	2.6473091762607366	2.436888193000435	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 56000.0$.

It's really an inspiring thing for them to do to go in and save these animals even in the midst of an ongoing conflict where they could have come to harm, as well as the animals. Also important is the situation in Gaza, and other conflict zones, makes it rather difficult to maintain a humanely run zoo, and have veterinarians on hand in case the animals become ill.	joy	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	86	1182	0.2307692307692307	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	3.1719106981473564	2.967885050559608	medium	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

It was long just an unspoken or open secret that everyone basically knew, but it's good that it's finally coming to light with people willing to speak up, especially the victims. If they didn't speak up, people would go on thinking that this kind of stuff only happens in TV and movies. Art imitates life, and vice versa.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	92	1183	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.1724137931034483	0.2413793103448276	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.1666666666666666	2.687378509538006	2.511262255975848	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

This conflict is rife with airstrikes and drone strikes that drop on civilians and militants alike. Qatar is culpable in the slaughter of citizens, which puts them firmly against the Geneva Conventions. Of course, I do not celebrate the loss of their soldiers' lives, as their families back home are just regular citizens as well in all likelihood.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	81	1185	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.28	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.0666666666666666	2.88022313174472	2.6624138295437967	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed. Yes, I'm sure everything is insured, but it's still a scary experience and I'd do everything I could to avoid it.	fear	2.0	4.0	3.0	33.0	60000.0	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	104	1197	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0833333333333333	2.283282633789956	2.1927734489412543	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

5.167000000000001	3.75	Did you hear what is happening in Aleppo? Residents are being texted (apparently from their government) to evacuate their homes in preparation of the city being bombed! It’s just terrible what those people have to endure. I feel so bad for them. Their country is already so war torn, and they are almost out of food. 2 pounds of meat costs $40. I can’t even begin to imagine what these people are going through.

She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.

In the beginning I wrote about how our friendship began, and wrote about all of my favorite memories with her from as far back as I could remember. Our first interaction to when we first started texting and getting to know each other, all the way up to when I wrote the letter. She is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how grateful she is to have me as a friend. I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me. I made the end of the letter forward looking and wrote of how grateful I considered myself to be because she was in my life, and how I hoped that wouldn’t change for a long, long time.	joy	1.0	4.0	3.0	28.0	456566.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	2.4290000000000003	3.571	2.571	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	150	1215	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.2647058823529412	0.1470588235294117	0.0588235294117647	0.2941176470588235	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.1111111111111111	2.972004839518797	2.7761004849593856	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 456566.0$.

Yes, it's cruel and seems to be brutal but at the same time it could be a good way of discouraging people to commit such crimes. On the other hand a victim's situation will not be improved or reversed because their perpetrator has been harmed in the same way.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	37.0	72000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	67	1230	0.1785714285714285	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0833333333333333	2.607597671774005	2.7896595154919823	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.

I find it extremely disturbing, since I can't imagine elephants being extinct. It makes me really angry that poachers are able to kill so many elephants, and that even if it's legal to trade ivory, the demand is still really high. I think finding a substitute for ivory is a better choice.

The victim here is being overshadowed by the gawker phenomenon.  It's sad.

Reading the article made me think about the show “Naked and Afraid” since the players are often in the jungle, trying to survivor and finding cocunuts on the trees.  Or on the TV show Survivor, where they often eat and drink coconut juice.  In honesty, I don’t know if I have ever eaten a cocunut even though I thought I did.

6.0	4.375	I’m glad that I don’t work at Well’s Fargo.  To think that they would push their employees to the brink of suicide and having mental health issues is totally ridiculous.  And all in the name of the almighty dollar.  I wish companies cared more for their employees, than their bottom line.  I have worked for a company for over 30 years and in the early years, the company cared about its employees.  They treated us like family.  The last ten or fifteen years have been so difficult.  They could care less about their loyal employees.  They treat us like dirt.  All they care about is how much money they can make, never caring about how much stress they are putting on their workers.  There has got to be a better way.  I’m so glad I will be retiring in another year or so.

2.5	4.625	I don't know about Bayh. I kind of wish he hadn't run again; I'm glad he's not trying again this time. After reading this story, it's hard to feel sympathetic, even in retrospect. But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	113	1283	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.3478260869565217	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.217391304347826	0.1428571428571428	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156656	low	low	An essay written by a 59.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500.0$.

Either way, it was man-made problems that did this little guy in. I wish they would blame it thoroughly on climate change, so people would maybe be spurred to do something. Instead, right now they'll say ""Oh, it wasn't *really* climate change,"" and when a more clear-cut extinction happens, they'll point back to this and say ""Well, it's been going on for a long time now, nothing we can do.""

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down. It may be our best shot.

2.167	3.875	It aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an opportunity to lead. It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	1286	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

I just read about a mother from Fresno Texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock school election for Donald Trump she also videotaped it. Well, of course, the video went viral. The Fort Bend County Texas sheriff's department went to check out the situation and the child seemed to be in good health. The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke. I hope the child is not permanently scarred from this incident.	neutral	2.0	2.0	1.0	60.0	74000.0	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	123	1295	0.0222222222222222	0.0222222222222222	0.1777777777777777	0.1555555555555555	0.0666666666666666	0.1777777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0	0.1777777777777777	0.0833333333333333	2.6428405006901152	2.67549175192833	low	low	An essay written by a 60.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000.0$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

This is unreal and aggravates me that teachers would do this and children would go along with it. The world needs to worry less about wants, quit being emotionally and physically weak and focus on needs, not wants. This whole story iis pathetic and all involved have ruined their own lives and for what, pleasure? They're all weak.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	50.0	65000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	1.286	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	85	1313	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0	0.1212121212121212	0.2424242424242424	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0	2.888202783309449	2.941527969439423	medium	medium	An essay written by a 50.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

2.167	7.0	Gay conversion therapy is terrible! I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to shame anyone into conversion therapy. I cannot stand Mike Pence and everything he stands for. He probably is a strong advocate because he is probably closeted! Why can't people just be ok with who they are?

A report I read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix! Well, it certainly is concerning to me! The report, released this month, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand supposedly the hub of the global Fairtrade system. I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

India claims they were destroying a terrorist encampment on the Pakistan side of the border, and Pakistan claims they bombed one of their military bases.

3.5	4.0	Muslim immigration seems to have some unique issues.  I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	1337	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

4.167	4.5	I think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma.  Some people die with less pain, and we tend to call them lucky.  I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	120	1339	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

I got stuck on a roller coaster one time and I hated it. I was scared out of my mind. That was the last time I ever got on a ride. I'm not putting myself though that again no matter how fun the rides used to be. That must have been a horrible death for those people.	fear	1.0	2.0	1.0	45.0	31000.0	6.5	1.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	1.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	1347	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0714285714285714	2.4925652284283326	2.624361670722964	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 31000.0$.

1.0	1.0	Man, car crashes happen all the time. There is no way they can be prevented. I would like to think that the smart cars of the future would help prevent this, but I am not to sure. Somebody could probably hack those and cause massive car wrecks as well. People should also drive safer as well. There is definitely too much speeding. I wonder if drunk driving was the cause of the wreck. That's a huge problem that causes a bunch of wrecks. Don't drink and drive people.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	45.0	31000.0	6.5	1.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	1.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	1348	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.51355829377779	2.460617345903608	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 31000.0$.

3.5	1.0	This article was about a rash of fires in the south, particularly Appalachia. It mentioned dry conditions causing numerous fires and contributing to pollution that made the air dangerous and unpleasant to breathe. It also said that some of the fires were probably caused by arson, but didn't dwell too much on that aspect. The quoted official mentioned that dry conditions meant more fires could easily be accidentally started and that was a danger.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	30000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	1349	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0	2.6931184321277915	2.582940908664521	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

They found mass graves of people killed by ISIS and although there is some confusion about the details, there are dozens or maybe over 100 bodies. There is also evidence of torture. The ISIS fighters were certainly brutal towards their victims, and have captured many more to use as human shields or to kill outright for their perceived beliefs.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	30000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	79	1350	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.858802959852571	2.793739728464708	medium	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

A new male birth control was rejected as having too many side effects on men, when options available to women have far more and more severe side effects. The article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed acceptable, but men are not accustomed to ceding convenience for responsibility, are used to women taking control in this area.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	30000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	83	1351	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0	2.883244988785839	2.813088766055183	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

To me it doesn't really matter as I never even thought about someone being a Jew until I got older. People are people. Jews are smart. Jews have always been smart at least for generations. Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate. OTOH people have a legitimate concern to fear that Trump being elected will cause problems like WW2 did. After all Jews tend to be Republican and likely donated a ton of money to Trump and they are more powerful today than they ever were.

1.833	1.0	I pretty much hate all wildlife including squirrels. They should  just go blast the little varmint. After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

It actually made me a bit angry, because it focuses on police deaths form two years ago and doesn't take into account current figures. Also, by focusing on deaths alone, it completely glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is safe in the current climate. It feels a lot like fake news to me.

These events show a vast contrast between both extremely hot weather and also extreme amounts of precipitation when compared across historical items.

Trump is far from a KKK icon, he's actually a Jew and a huge supporter of Zionism/Israel- this should make him a huge enemy of the KKK but instead it's all fake, orchestrated BS to keep us totally distracted from what's really up.	anger	2.0	3.0	1.0	21.0	21000.0	3.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	3.5	3.571	4.0	3.571	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	72	1399	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.5	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.479196444801524	2.394792239846013	low	low	An essay written by a 21.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 21000.0$.

3.0	4.5	You know one thing late Thursday that the Islamic State used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq. The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	1400	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

You can't expect the gun to be blamed when it is someone who is just pissed off or mental ill. If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments.

2.0	1.0	I do think that this male birth control for men should be a thing. Men should be able to decide if those risks are worth the protection. Men should have the ability to take birth control in their own hands, as they never know if a woman is lieing about taking her's or if they have been taking it properly. An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing. Women, get over it. If your side effects from your birth control are too strong, then just don't have sex.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1474	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1515151515151515	0.0	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.78421836330545	2.6997879597824745	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

4.167	4.0	This female lawyer that accused her boss of sexually harassing her may very well be a true story in every detail. Things like this happened previously at a very alarming rate and continue to happen today even if it is less frequent. The problem with bringing these issues forward at a later date is that it is hard for these claims to be validated with so much time in between the actual act. I think the rhetoric and climate of current administration in the white house also helps add to the power of these men to just deny the claims.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	55000.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	3.286	3.143	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	100	1500	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1935483870967742	0.1612903225806451	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.7967826308007746	2.79404522207873	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

We have a liar for a president, and nobody is remaining in the streets until it's taken care of.	surprise	2.0	7.0	1.0	34.0	53000.0	3.5	7.0	5.5	6.0	4.5	4.714	1.857	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	80	1513	0.0	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1	2.643180889559435	2.5642377891519783	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 53000.0$.

5.0	3.375	So I just read an article about a new lawsuit that is happening. There is a group of women who are suing L'Oréal. Apparently after using one of their prosucts that was supposed to give them nice and thick hair it actually made them go bald and left them with blisters and stuff on their heads. How messed up is that? Imagine using some hair product and then having it ruin your head. I hope they win the suit and get all of the 5 million that they are asking for. If you know anyone who uses L'Oréal you may want to advise them against it in the future.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	109	1530	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	2.873741912232741	2.688766099524577	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

We can't let the native americans or anyone in this area suffer like they are and just stand by and watch.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	102	1546	0.1724137931034483	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.0	0.1379310344827586	0.2413793103448276	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.8426880678147906	2.748109900608261	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

If people do not take notice and make this cause a forefront in our minds I believe that we will wipe out the Rhino population as well as other large game and mammal species.

It will help the people they have harmed and seek to right the wrong and there will be justice. Wells Fargo is big and they should not harm others and the articles is well told on what happened to them and what they did in detail.

I would read this article and think about the good things that happen when you drive nicely and with control towards others and your vehicle.	joy	1.0	2.0	2.0	33.0	24000.0	6.0	5.0	4.0	7.0	6.5	4.143	1.143	3.286	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	79	1562	0.0285714285714285	0.0	0.1714285714285714	0.2285714285714285	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	0.1714285714285714	0.2631578947368421	2.9850821509048187	2.637545285913018	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 24000.0$.

Now they want to sue the company, can't blame them for that since I would sue them too. How could you be so stupid as to park your boat above a reef during rough weather especially when it's the USS TinyPOS. I'd sue them into the ground too. Eitherway this article tells you all about it, it's pretty boring to read and there really isn't much to say about it other than everyone involved in this incident is a moron and most likely deserved everything that happened to them. They probably cheaped out on the tour and/or weren't wearing their lifevests during the tour. Boat captain deserved to lose his ship because he's obviously an idiot for setting up the boat where he did.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	35.0	145000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	1.5	7.0	2.286	1.0	2.4290000000000003	1.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	145	1565	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1388888888888889	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0333333333333333	2.670841222604748	2.4201446644643427	medium	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 145000.0$.

Besides, I always find these perspectives backwards: people who are seemingly more concerned about the welfare of animals than people.

2.833	3.625	The article is very well-written and relatively thoughtful.  I also find it heartwarming and touching at times.  However, it's also overflowing with this self-centered ignorance that our internet culture has engendered over the last decade. We are specks, even on this planet, even in our own cities.  It's an enormous world--unfathomably large.  To think that it is not irrational to be afraid of terrorism is stupid.  Statistically speaking--i.e. RATIONALLY speaking--it is absurd to be afraid of terrorism.  And yet intelligent people are.  They see the world too much through their phones, through the images (images, not tangible things) depicted on it.  The world that exists in our phones does not exist in reality.  They are two distinct things.  People are stupid.	joy	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	121	1571	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.3461538461538461	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.349244202322921	2.3799756084089427	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.  Entitlement doesn't produce better outcomes; it produces more entitlement.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	1573	0.0285714285714285	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1818181818181818	2.568093060720685	2.4210217316585747	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I remember one time, we waited almost 20 minutes to get gasoline and it was terrifying.

I understand that Obama supports that something needs to change, but there is other evidence out there that shows that this is naturally occurring and something that will right itself in time.  I do agree that we need to cut back on our excessive use of electricity.  A little knowledge and everyday self-awareness would likely help us go in the right direction.

It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct.

6.0	2.125	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	130	1594	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.25	0.05	0.05	0.0588235294117647	2.921270175908798	2.719409547178719	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

I think it's ridiculous that the premiere of B.C., of the awful NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they did the best they could in difficult conditions.  But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.  But what can be done about any of this now other than clean it up and try not to have it happen again.

It seems crazy that plastic floating in the ocean can be harming sea birds but it also does make some sense. Just more humans doing harm to things that we had no business messing with to begin with.

I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

4.833333333333333	7.0	I'm so tired of all this violence. If a cop shoots someone suddenly it's acceptable to go around and commit violence or loot and steal. We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1616	0.1956521739130435	0.1521739130434782	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0652173913043478	0.0652173913043478	0.217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0	2.746293485206892	2.898086076746432	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	111	1619	0.1162790697674418	0.1395348837209302	0.0465116279069767	0.0232558139534883	0.0465116279069767	0.0930232558139534	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.1162790697674418	0.0465116279069767	0.0	2.425378731837707	2.480071312673714	low	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

1.8333333333333333	2.625	I find this story to be eye-rollingly typical of people.  I assume that the people who go up to the Arctic to see it like polar bears and don't want to see them extinct.  And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.
