4.0	2.0	I am writing as regards my thoughts on a tragic death of a 2-year-old boy, who fell from the 11th floor of an apartment building early Wednesday morning. Investigators said the window of the child's bedroom was open and he was able to push open the screen. Officers and paramedics rushed to the Willoughby Hills Towers apartment complex on Chardon Road after a security guard reported a small child fell out of the window and onto the parking deck below. This is a tragic incident that got me really sad.	neutral/sadness	2.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	100000.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	90	2144	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.2592592592592592	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.0	2.766547905347025	2.6963979183946307	medium	low	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

The air stroke that struck the wrong area and accidentlally hit a hospital killing dozens really seems sketchy. There is no regard for human life and that is truly scary.

4.166666666666667	5.125	I hate hearing about American troop deaths.  I feel sad for the Captain and First Sergeant who died.  Those are experienced and high-ranking people.  I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.  And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death.	anger/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	2167	0.2	0.14	0.04	0.06	0.02	0.08	0.2	0.14	0.08	0.04	0.0	2.3879661194222765	2.220323323534724	low	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

And most of the victims are african american men. This is a criss. Leave it to Donald to try to sweep it under the rug. Moreover, violent crime has increased by over 2%. Even though this is considered a low increase, why aren't we focusing on having a DECREASE instead of just accepting a lower increase? Also, that bus crash sounds so scary, I'm glad no one was seriously injured.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	37.0	135000.0	6.0	6.0	1.5	7.0	3.0	4.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	103	1506	0.1428571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1	2.500831711023812	2.629306423854345	low	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 135000.0$.

They seemed relatively happy on the exterior.

I feel like there should be some kind of action plan in place for animals in countries that are experiencing hardship so that they can be transported to other places in times of crisis.

For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away.

More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness.

I'm not particularly surprised that the method of stunning chickens has a failure rate.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	24.0	60000.0	6.5	4.0	6.5	4.0	7.0	3.286	2.857	3.0	2.714	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	1382	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	2.857994738271429	2.9129250167450538	low	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I really think we need to do better taking care of our troops... even in the beginning. Do we really need them?

I'm all for having the right to bear arms to protect yourself of an intruder, but is an assault rifle really necessary? I think these kind of weapons really push the limit and how a citizen should be armed. A pistol or even a shotgun is enough in my opinion. But a high powered assault rifle?

I certainly feel for anyone looking for a better life and at times wish all countries had open borders as this one isn't so great at times but we do have laws and many immigrants enter other countries legally and I think there needs to be some sort of controls that make the process fair to legal citizens.

Either way, it was man-made problems that did this little guy in. I wish they would blame it thoroughly on climate change, so people would maybe be spurred to do something. Instead, right now they'll say ""Oh, it wasn't *really* climate change,"" and when a more clear-cut extinction happens, they'll point back to this and say ""Well, it's been going on for a long time now, nothing we can do.""

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

It makes me upset to know Native American tribes are being affected by drought to the point of possibly ceasing to exist. I have Native American heritage and feel that this population should be cared for by our government before segments of third world countries. I don't like the fact that air pollution is a problem or a salty lake is drying up in Iran but I understand our environment is controlled by God. We, as a nation, choose our battles sometimes based on the wrong things. Taking care of the Native American tribesman should be a HUGE priority!	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	138	1287	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.691946742357494	2.6282738839839004	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

4.166666666666667	1.25	So teen suicide is on the rise which I find very sad.  It seems so avoidable and people are way too young to be making decisions to end their life while they're still a child, I mean what on earth is that about?  I Think there has been a lot of things related to bullying that have contributed to this and also just a breakdown of the family in general.  Maybe kids don't feel like they have enough support system anymore.  I do not know but whatever the reason it is extremely tragic.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1696	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.868938478547276	2.6394276643328625	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

What she was subjected to was absolutely unacceptable for someone of her age, and it can only be described as a dreadful and disturbing experience. It is my firm belief that both parents should be imprisoned for the entirety of their lives or potentially even receive capital punishment.

It teaches you to survive on bare minimum. Poverty teaches gratitude.  Some of the most happy people in the world are those people who have the least.  When you aren't flooded with tons of material goods you can focus more on the simple things that you do have.

6.0	6.0	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	119	1983	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.

3.0	1.75	It must be terrifying to be in a trail derailment like that.  Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

And that she was widely respected warms my heart.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	41000.0	4.5	7.0	3.0	6.0	1.0	4.286	2.857	4.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	63	2012	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.5913824275102924	2.3174895559382307	low	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 41000.0$.

The only way it can heal is people have to quit thinking about me, me, me, and look out for the nation and others.   It seems it just comes down to what vitriol will be posted to some social media site.  People are numb to all of it yet all the national media continues to support one side or the other and not see it as what it is.  	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	62.0	29000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	87	1914	0.0	0.1	0.0	0.3	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	2.7627858649514514	2.611621862232677	medium	low	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 29000.0$.

Even though you might have it rough, ultimately it is up to you to decide to break the law or use drugs or not.  So they had free will too and could have exercised that.  Regardless, it is still sad that they went through a rough childhood.

The orangantans who number seven fifty to seventeen fifty will be completly wiped out if the company that is clearing this land is allowed to continue. What can we do to form a protest  or let the government know that this is not right.Can you help me with some ideas?   Maybe we email the indonesian government first or attempt to call them. After that maybe we can plan to picket or have a demonstration at the capitol building voicing our concerns. Do you feel the same about this that I do? if you dont I will get someone else to help me or I will go it alone.  I just feel so strongly that something productive needs to be done and fast.

Since she is stronger, she will survive, then they can bring her back to complete health, then do it again for the next 3 years, then keep repeating it until she dies. I can't comprehend why people like this do these things, but there is a special place in hell. I don't buy the mental illness garbage. OF COURSE she has a mental illness, but that shouldn't automatically imply protection from justice. The very nature of murder, especially of this kind, requires a mental illness to a certain degree, so no pleading insanity.

I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

I feel like theres so many different levels to these happenings and something has to be done on each to prevent little children from getting these pills in there hands. On the level of the manufactorers we need to have way better packaging like codes the kids cant get into. Doctors prescribing these should ask if they have kids and tell them preventetive measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. Parents need to have a better understanding how easy it is for kids to get into these and die. So senseless dying of something so easy to prevent.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714									110	2351	0.2608695652173913	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	3.0755993668938477	3.0239750251357607	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000$.

But, on the other side of the coin, the chances are pretty slim of that happening. Plus, if you think about it, the worst thing that happens, if that were to occur, is that I die and then nothing is my problem anymore. I'm in no rush to die, but if it happens, it happens. It's an inevitability.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	43.0	48000.0	6.0	3.5	2.5	3.5	7.0	3.429	1.0	3.571	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	82	1305	0.2083333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.125	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	2.4310841722803325	2.3964697793915875	low	low	An essay written by a 43.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000.0$.

I think it was interesting and informative to know of some of their malpractices. The settlement is good and correct to right some of the wrongs they have done and people they have harmed. It will help the people they have harmed and seek to right the wrong and there will be justice. Wells Fargo is big and they should not harm others and the articles is well told on what happened to them and what they did in detail. They were fined for repeated violations and have a clear intent of what they were doing and how they were acting towards their customers and was not the best way to act towards others.

3.5	4.0	Muslim immigration seems to have some unique issues.  I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	1337	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.

It shows they have no moral compass and consious. I feel for that girl how you could ever live a normal life or create real relationships after being used for sex for so long is beyond me.

1.0	6.625	I just read an article about a school volunteer being indicted on child porn charges. I cannot understand what makes these monsters tick. It seems as if every day I am reading about a case of child sex abuse. I think these people should be killed on site. That would change their minds before commiting sex acts on a child. It just keeps getting worse and worse, more and more common. They will be spared in court. They will more than likely get probation and released right back into the community they victimized. It really makes me sick. I went to prison for 5 years for a crime that I didnt even commit, but sex offenders rarely if ever get sent to prison.	disgust	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.714	1.0	1.714	4.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	123	1445	0.1549295774647887	0.0845070422535211	0.1267605633802817	0.0704225352112676	0.0140845070422535	0.1267605633802817	0.1408450704225352	0.1267605633802817	0.056338028169014	0.0985915492957746	0.0	2.719671330098382	2.805733768250068	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

I guess the hope would be that others could learn from this tragedy.  Whether it was an issu with the jet itself or a lack of training, hopefully they can figure out what caused this tragedy so it can be prevented in the future.

4.167	5.0	There's something terrifying about being attacked by animals. It's even more horrifying to find out the animals that are attacking you are the ones you think are so cute and adorable. I just read an article about squirrels attacking a retirement home and injuring three elderly. It must have been so terrifying for them to encounter this event. Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases. I feel troubled thinking about this because these elderly can't really react quick enough in these situations.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	1024	0.1860465116279069	0.1162790697674418	0.0465116279069767	0.0232558139534883	0.0465116279069767	0.1162790697674418	0.2093023255813953	0.1162790697674418	0.0930232558139534	0.0465116279069767	0.0	3.0442484540163	3.051787245699867	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

Nor do I think they have any right to do what they're doing.  And every country has every right to keep them out and let them deal with their own situation in their own country.  But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.
