It is amazing to me that people are so out of control that they can't even handle a verbal dispute with someone.  Its easy, just walk away!

5.167000000000001	4.875	Feelings are deemed appropriate if they fit the current situation. Since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal, they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation. Emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel. Feelings are not permanent, but an ongoing thing because people constantly try to bring up, suppress, or manage feelings	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	73	188	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.3	0.0	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.9917231199046785	2.922755860176507	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

It is clearly and issue but they'll make a vaccine for those who don't become immune by way of their own system, then the virus will become resistant to the vaccinations and it will be a never ending up and down cycle that we see all the time.

All these people clutching to one religion or another (often just as a mask for their rage) and killing each other out of tribal animus.  It hasnt changed, well, ever.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

These animals are more important that the people poaching them. Those poachers deserve to die; they are horrible people and they are destroying a unique species. This is a terrible thing. They desperately need to protect these poor rhinoes from people.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	60000.0	6.0	4.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	4.143	4.857	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	61	296	0.1818181818181818	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.1818181818181818	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0769230769230769	3.12513653855677	2.8962122857818247	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

There's also a similar bacteria called naegleria fowlerii that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain.

1.0	1.25	This story specifically doesn't make me feel anything, since I don't know these people and I feel like if I tried to have emotions for every victim of a crime I read about that would just require too much mental effort. In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

I say stupid because ignorance is simply not having a lack of intelligence or something, but you're still willing to educate yourself or be educated on it. Stupidity is being surrounded by so many outlets, professors, libraries, internet, magazines, and still refusing to learn about those that are different from you.	anger	2.0	6.0	3.0	28.0	35000.0	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	1133	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.3846153846153846	0.3846153846153846	0.0	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.656298210562152	2.681233949912142	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

6.0	5.625	Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed.

There needs to be another option.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	75000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	6.5	6.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	3.571	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	14	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.4	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.0	2.8384798246330862	2.8852451856284387	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Today with social media we just see the problems more out in front since nothing is private anymore. I'm older 63 as you know and my mom and granny taught me how to behave. Don't go into a room with some man you don't know. If he tries something tell someone. All these ladies who kept quiet or were paid off in some way are just as big a part of the problem as any man who abuses them.

Sucks we are still living  a society where woman are not created or treated fairly.	disgust	1.0	5.0	2.0	39.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	65	896	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	2.782699198499485	2.761573909006686	medium	medium	An essay written by a 39.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

6.5	6.875	This article about post-traumatic stress disorder is disturbing on many levels. This country really doesn't take care of our veterans. Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	529	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.0416666666666666	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

Maybe I can put down the mosquito shotgun for now and aim for a slightly stronger spray for my clothing."	surprise	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	146	942	0.125	0.125	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.037037037037037	2.527744013720697	2.4238851744935817	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

I found out in an article talking about a remark he apparently made regarding Val Kilmer, who ostensibly also may or may not be battling oral cancer. Setting aside the absurdity of the media relaying a he said-she said moment with no relevance to the greater world beyond the individuals to whom it applies, it is terrifying to think how prevalent cancer is.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	39.0	48000.0	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	761	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.803514550588925	2.62093425547771	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000.0$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population.

It's not surprising that Wells Fargo was opening fake accounts. Imagine the headache of having to deal with that on your credit report. Those customers should be compensated big time for this. Of course, nobody will be prosecuted.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	71	314	0.0	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.1666666666666666	2.1836694914833017	2.293853040906474	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

4.667	6.625	I don't really like coconuts, I think everyone knows that, but I still think that they play a huge role in our ecosystem. I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis. It just makes me worried about the environment overall because I really worry about global warming and I just really worry about the environment in general.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	143	458	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0344827586206896	2.758468311453905	2.5576228803693977	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

1.6669999999999998	3.875	I really feel bad for Turkey. I think they are trying to do everything they can to get rid of terrorism in the country. It seems that their efforts are for naught. They want to keep the people safe and yet more terrorist groups keep popping up. Then the lawmakers are involved and there is only so much you can do. Turkey is constantly at war. I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here. It is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want peace. There is always terrorism and someone trying to bring down a country, but the country tries its hardest to fight back despite opposition.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	82000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	4.714	3.286	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	129	534	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0555555555555555	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.7844872062063515	2.7601166472237884	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 82000.0$.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again. Attorney Al Gerhardstein, who represents the DuBose family, said they want another trial and can’t understand why the jury couldn’t reach a conclusion. “With the video	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	177	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.2777777777777778	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8319663967427458	2.859068827652776	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	138	940	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.3928571428571428	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.6999825947228584	2.461963714232384	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

3.667	4.625	This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

Some believe that some of these physicians and psychiatrist should bear the brunt of the blame for torture at Guantanamo Bay.	anger	1.0	6.0	6.0	27.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	2.5	4.571000000000001	3.571	3.571	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	1087	0.1428571428571428	0.2	0.0571428571428571	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.3541344589540354	2.407856294561003	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.167000000000001	5.25	In this Food, water fears remain year after Brazil mine dam disaster — COLATINA, Brazil — One year after a dam ruptured and sent a giant wave of metal-laden mud gushing into one of Brazil’s most important rivers, people who live along the banks won’t drink the water and fishermen are afraid to eat their catch. Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.This equally large amount of  aquatic.	fear	1.0	4.0	3.0	32.0	50000.0	3.5	3.5	5.0	3.5	3.5	3.143	3.143	3.286	2.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	141	1035	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.0	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.1081081081081081	0.0	0.0	2.8811144346996973	2.706010688031269	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

Whats interesting about this is the environment and the species in these ecosystems are going through morphological changes. Sometimes we get this idea that climate change will eradicate all life from the Earth but it seems that we will be able to adapt to it to a certain extent. By no means am I say we shouldn't make changes to solve climate change but it is interesting to seem how life is adapting to the changes.	neutral	1.0	6.0	6.0	27.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	2.5	4.571000000000001	3.571	3.571	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	91	1086	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8774915542186603	2.7565353454400663	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

3.833	4.375	I feel that it is a common thing to have intentions misplaced. The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

I feel for those that were put out of work.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	52000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	2.0	5.5	1.143	1.286	2.286	2.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	81	289	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0909090909090909	2.633171040552187	2.467648885650855	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 52000.0$.

5.832999999999999	5.625	After reading that article on the Arctic Ice, I feel that maybe we should get together and do something. Maybe find an organization to donate time and money too. I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe. We can't mess up the one we have.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	40.0	31000.0	6.0	4.5	1.0	7.0	5.0	3.714	2.286	4.0	4.2860000000000005	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	147	642	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.77287713246278	2.673174398704549	low	low	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31000.0$.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

Gilbert and Wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason (birthday, anniversary, or promotion etc.) and how long they thought that feeling would last. People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	128	185	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.064516129032258	2.976505059449956	2.831572665407568	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I guess it’s an unsolicited public service message of sorts.  She had some sort of tumor that made it necessary.  She had the baby and that’s the god news.  Surprisingly, she got about 1200 “likes” in total.  I found myself wanting to out of sympathy.  Who needs birth control with this kind of publicity?  She says she loves her scar.

She lost her vision and 14 years old because she was shot repeatedly with pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for months trying to regain her vision, but so far it has not been successful. She is trying to stay positive now but she knows that she has a difficult road ahead of her.

It is very fortunate that we live in a time where doctors can assist individuals with such issues, so people should really seek help.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	45000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	5.5	7.0	4.857	1.714	3.0	2.4290000000000003	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	1161	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0	2.94866815845029	2.894836302036614	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

They also spend a lot of time online, especially on YouTube. The videos on there are more influential, since they are real people, and the ads are more convincing. The article made me not want to let the kids watch YouTube or go online, which is really hard to do.

1.0	1.0	I said Trump would win. Polls said otherwise, I didn't care, I knew the fucker would win. I think people are not willing to accept that others are really shitty and that someone like Trump would be voted in. They can't see past others. People have too much faith in others, too much trust. There are a lot of vile people out there, just gotta encourage them a little bit and they'll come out. Trump was their encouragement. What will the liberals do now? I don't know. Sometimes I think we will be okay, sometimes I think we won't. I just know that going to one march is going to do shit. You need tens of marches, packed to the brim. You need them every weekend. For months. You need to call your officials, complain, elect them, vote them out. Do more. But one march isn't going to do shit.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.714	2.571	4.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	150	633	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1	0.0769230769230769	2.4329122735330047	2.4434575110408967	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around. To date, the world has a total of 30.1 million km2, or around 20 percent of the world’s land area, that remain as wilderness, with the majority being located in countries in North America, North Asia, Australia and Nort	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	648	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.7576904942460643	2.5433314487504117	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

1.167	3.5	I find the story of the wolf's death more ironic and amusing than saddening.  It's just a single wolf; it could have died innumerable ways.  I really don't care.  I find the article describing it to be absurd, however.  Describing a Wildlife Services program in the way it did was over-the-top.  Besides, I always find these perspectives backwards: people who are seemingly more concerned about the welfare of animals than people.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	144	619	0.0377358490566037	0.0943396226415094	0.1509433962264151	0.2075471698113207	0.0943396226415094	0.1698113207547169	0.0566037735849056	0.0566037735849056	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.064516129032258	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

The only thing I gained when I got married was another child, in the form of a grown man.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0	6.5	5.5	2.0	6.5	4.0	4.571000000000001	3.0	4.0	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	77	1576	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.0	0.2	0.08	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.1818181818181818	2.4858219028380297	2.483849738853342	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.

4.5	4.625	Perception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal reaction among receivers (see emotions), but varies depending upon one's tendency to handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past experiences, and any number of other factors. Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.  People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons. Some people buy beauty products in hopes of achieving a state of happiness or a sense of self beauty or as an act or expression of beauty	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	129	300	0.0	0.0	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.4	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.32	0.064516129032258	3.017991886307053	2.80709984054877	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

The only hope is that he doesnt start a nuclear war and that he will eventually be tried and brought to justice for his numerous crimes.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	48.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	3.857	1.0	4.857	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	109	846	0.1176470588235294	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.2058823529411764	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.1470588235294117	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.088235294117647	0.0476190476190476	2.77756036687727	2.8494142359333883	low	low	An essay written by a 48.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

It was not like super tragic but it just makes me think about my own life. It also makes me really think about my living situation. I have never thought about how I live in an apartment building shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences. For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control. It really freaks me out now that I know someone besides just myself could ruin my home or personal belongings. Even worse, someone could lose their life.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	50000.0	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	137	796	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.744424323629415	2.6927003226889843	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

4.0	4.75	I read an article about the gender gap in the world today. Sadly the US has moved down in the list behind all of the major European countries. I guess the number of women working in senior positions is shrinking. There is also a decline of women in the labor force. But there is evidence that the education gender gap is shrinking, so there are more women educated. It just seems that more women are choosing not to work.	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	248	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.46893929319281	2.4529082285191683	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	108	541	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

These type of losses could have been avoided if they received more help or they could have trained them more for incase any unexpected events that could occur like this one for example.	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	24.0	15000.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	5.0	2.571	2.714	3.143	2.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	423	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.2083333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	3.046756173320193	2.9122339132089143	low	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

Teenagers have enough to deal with without having to worry about being prodded into doing something horrible like committing suicide by these online idiots!

1.0	6.0	President Donald Trumps actions during his election and so far during the presidency has been nothing short of childish.  I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.  Like the previous article, we could be comparing President Trump to Hitler, which in my opinion is absolutely terrible.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	90	434	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0666666666666666	2.44516410624263	2.502142799243855	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

Taxi driver Aguek Nyok helped passengers escape. He was in the area meaning to get a haircut and kicked the bus door three times before managing to break it open. ""All the people were at the back trying to get out of the bus but they couldn't get out the front because of the flames,"" he told the Courier-Mail newspaper. ""They couldn't open the back door so I kicked it down and they all came running out. ""It was one of the two: you get the people out or they're going to die."" Mr Nyok said there were three children among the passengers. Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said it was ""a very, very sad day for the council and the wider community"".

I know we were talking the other day about being worried about getting stuck in a situation like this because of all the recent shootings. I think this story was a real eye opener for me, because it shows just how easy something like this happening would be. I feel that what you said about mental health and paying more attention to the youth is really another central point to this story. This story made me think even more about owning a gun and having a open carry permit to keep safe and be able to protect my loved ones and family.	fear	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	119	828	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.948809108057129	2.7812604972856665	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions. The target is to keep temperature rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	129	217	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0	2.565794993410829	2.545485810700536	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

Eitherway this article tells you all about it, it's pretty boring to read and there really isn't much to say about it other than everyone involved in this incident is a moron and most likely deserved everything that happened to them. They probably cheaped out on the tour and/or weren't wearing their lifevests during the tour.

5.5	4.0	I can not believe the struggle that has to be. And for god sake, all of them are mostly arsons, well into the 70% range. I can't believe that at all. Seems a bit high but I guess people just have no respect for nature or other peoples lives. Having your house burn down in a wild fire has to be one of the worst things that coudl happen to someone. All your belongings, all those memories, the life you built and the family or friends you surroudned yourself with. Gone. Well hopefully not your family gone cause then you'd really be in trouble but your hosue at least and sentimental things. I hope that never happens to you.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	27.0	52000.0	7.0	6.0	5.0	6.5	6.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	2.143	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	119	790	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.125	0.1176470588235294	2.595930762433392	2.4719082796842144	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 52000.0$.

The real worry isn't so much the problem with Global warming..they can stand that somewhat..the problem is we are damaging the planet and fresh water so rapidly they can not withstand it.   More than 60 percent of Turtles and their Shelled brothers are in danger.. they are vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.  We should do something to stop this.

I mean I know you're a big gold fan, so I understand how this is upsetting you. I will send you more articles about him later on today so we can talk more about him. What do you think? Who do you think was better? Jack or Arnold? What about tiger? Either way, I hope you get this article and it helps lift your spirits a bit.

The barrier was at the right standard, and the gorilla did what a gorilla is going to do if something like that happens. I place the blame on the parents who somehow let their 3 year old child climb into a gorilla enclosure.

I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.  This just shows you that people are pretty much the same, and pretty much were savages, until recently.

I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

1.833	1.0	I pretty much hate all wildlife including squirrels. They should  just go blast the little varmint. After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

The article described some of the ways people are protesting, from covering the star with graffiti, to putting a Bernie Sanders sticker on it, to putting a barbed wire fence around it.

We need to reduce the amount of chickens being slaughtered in a whole and a full stop to ""conscious chicken killings"".  The extent of chickens being exposed to such a stunned death is a result of lack of regulation in the chicken industry.  Animal groups need to lobby and face congress on this for the welfare of chickens and any other animals facing the same process of killing. I blame the U.S Department of Agriculture for even allowing this type of murder to have ever started.

The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.  I guess thats a price you have to pay if you make enemies in the world.  You are either looking over your shoulder all the time or completely stressed to death.

I feel our land is important ,I feel as though cattle should be able to graze and that we have a huge problem when it comes to economic issues,due to the way that livestock is taken care of,to produce food for people. It is heartbreaking to see people fight for land they love it, and it’s heartbreaking for the police to have to shoot people over it. people lose years of their lives in prison over land and cattle and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted in court cases. the whole article was a mess!	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	30000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.143	3.857	4.571000000000001	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	1293	0.1764705882352941	0.1568627450980392	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0196078431372549	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.0784313725490196	0.0588235294117647	0.0392156862745098	0.0	3.121228650029198	2.9456770444719145	medium	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 30000.0$.

But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.  The article made comparisons with Cuba, and previous leadership, but I did not fine a clear solution.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	40000.0	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	114	667	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.4285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.664979211588646	2.4560975066976654	low	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

When we quit and win our freedom from addiction, our mindset changes. After I quit I came to realize how much I really don't like it!

But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop. I do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to save themselves, and this is the biggest tragedy of all.	fear	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	918	0.25	0.0	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.0666666666666666	2.726847471609561	2.818324191358616	low	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.

With state firefighters scrambling to quench the blazes currently active, officials told people to avoid starting new fires that could quickly spread. “We’re a cigar butt away from a disaster,” said John Williams, adventure guide at Amicalola Falls, a state park near the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail in Georgia	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	160000.0	4.5	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	3.429	3.429	2.714	3.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	92	266	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0454545454545454	2.799943670032915	2.755262814762689	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 160000.0$.

6.5	5.625	Honestly I do feel bad for him but at the same time you should not be taking a selfie around an animal that is clearly so dangerous. Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	459	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.911129203084617	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

He doesn't lose his job and he isn't majorly damaged.

Apparently a lot of people are thinking that this could be foul play and it wouldn't be a surprise since the Russian government is known for doing this sort of thing all the time. He was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal government which would have angered the Russian government so I bet they killed him off so that they could avoid him giving away information to the federal government.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	100000.0	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	103	1273	0.2580645161290322	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.04	2.660010450956814	2.6312349582327843	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

3.167	4.0	Hey,  I think you should be careful around the Canonsburg area next time you visit Pennsylvania. The crime has been increasingly more dangerous within the past few years. According to this article that I read online, a police officer was shot to death and another police officer was injured in an ambush. I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	24.0	55000.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	829	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1458333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.91722408565792	2.8410753633042187	medium	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.5	4.125	This is a bizarre story.  A man bashed a turtles head with a hammer in self defense.  He is being held on 5000 bail.  The only part of the story I find interesting is that the man dragged the turtle into the middle of the road and left it there. I'm not sure I believe the man.  Claiming self defense against a turtle seems crazy. I think the man could of just left the turtle alone and not of been in this situation to begin with.	surprise	1.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	125000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	3.429	3.286	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	86	965	0.2	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0714285714285714	2.5384191700789698	2.6730834297754558	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 125000.0$.

It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	136	1593	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.24	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.0526315789473684	2.9615192213757	2.7765868181672064	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.5	4.625	Sleep is very important, and I’m quite sure you know that already. However, some aspects of life–like habits, even smartphones, and stress in work–affect our sleep cycles. A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

2.833	5.125	I recently discovered a few articles that I believed to be quite interesting. The first article talks about how people argue that smoking should be banned in public places so that children would not imitate them.

4.167	4.5	I think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma.  Some people die with less pain, and we tend to call them lucky.  I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	120	1339	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

I hope that things change in those areas of the world and more security is put in place so these types of attacks can be detected and negated.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	57	481	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1	2.777310807963145	2.8265321478204037	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

1.0	1.0	I honestly find this article more amusing than anything.  I absolutely loathe birds.  Can't stand them.  Want them all dead.  I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.  The Asians are.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	117	1614	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0	0.2592592592592592	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.0	2.2105266099618204	2.19769536482916	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

3.333	2.5	That is really sad to hear. It's awful that cars can be so unsafe and sometimes people forget how easy it is to get into an accident if everyone isn't careful and observant. It said this happened at 6:30pm so I wonder if maybe the sun was shining right in someone's eyes because that has happened to me at sunset and I could barely see. It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	77	484	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.811145798313764	2.7370854918760794	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

7.0	7.0	Non-human animals are given rights only because of their interactions with human beings. Without involvement with humans, animals do not deserve rights. It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have. As for human rights, it’s always uncertain.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	4000.0	6.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	3.286	3.286	3.857	2.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	100	427	0.0967741935483871	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0909090909090909	3.29174545168244	3.0966170841260285	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 4000.0$.

He gets torn down before he has a chance to do anything. I'm just so mad at the whole election system and the way things are done.

It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely.

1.0	1.625	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation. It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	281	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

1.5	1.875	I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday. A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

The terrorists won't even allow people to leave the city they're holding, to try and reach the Iraqi army nearby who could help them. Maybe the UN needs to step in and do something.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	42.0	70500.0	6.0	2.0	2.5	4.0	4.0	3.143	3.143	3.429	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	58	332	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.1111111111111111	2.370291451767843	2.3573036886200023	low	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70500.0$.

6.0	6.0	did you hear about the wolf that got shot by a government sniper in Idaho I think it was. He was a special wolf from a pack in California that was endangered and had a tracking device on him so they could monitor his movements. he had already traveled 700 miles looking for a mate, which is what wolves do when they come of age. They are trying to hold them accountable for the needless and cruel slaughter of wild animals. I forgot the name of the group. But I hope they stop them. Animals need more laws that protect them from evil garbage people.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	58.0	20000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	3.143	3.429	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	105	1008	0.1463414634146341	0.0975609756097561	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0975609756097561	0.1219512195121951	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.0555555555555555	3.0135964648506186	2.848950326566398	medium	medium	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

5.667000000000001	5.625	The dwindling wilderness is due, in part to humanity’s activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and of course, oil and gas exploration. The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	113	647	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	3.009758951199248	2.78106625686191	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns.

As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.

If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas.

I feel bad for them, we've all been tricked at least once in our lives by something on the internet, but it isn't like this guy cracked the security of google and we're all doomed.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	15000.0	4.0	5.5	1.0	5.0	1.0	3.429	3.143	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	1334	0.15	0.075	0.05	0.075	0.05	0.1	0.225	0.125	0.075	0.075	0.0434782608695652	2.8663927139911887	2.831505975331784	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 15000.0$.

6.0	1.625	It is very alarming to my spirit that humans who were once adopted by American citizens would be scrutinized for no reason of their own doing.  There is so many things wrong with the American system of adopting children from other countries.  If we are going to adopt children from other countries as Americans, they should be granted their citizenship immediately upon being adopted. Before another adoption takes place that involves American parents, and innocent children from another country, there needs to be new rules, regulations, and laws mandated for the protection of these children and families of what can be deemed as a sloppy American adoption system.  Let's fix it right away.	anger	2.0	7.0	3.0	50.0	80000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	2.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1522	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.1875	0.0625	0.3125	0.25	0.0	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	2.916676908783881	2.8751049347149267	medium	medium	An essay written by a 50.0 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place.

That's overkill and risky.	anger	1.0	2.0	2.0	23.0	40000.0	5.0	6.0	3.0	4.0	4.5	4.2860000000000005	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	74	1494	0.2631578947368421	0.2368421052631578	0.0263157894736842	0.0263157894736842	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2631578947368421	0.0	0.0263157894736842	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.655988655212149	2.5034387601724943	medium	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.0	5.625	The article is misguided in many ways, and obviously only prevents one perspective on all of these very complicated issues.  I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.  Entitlement doesn't produce better outcomes; it produces more entitlement.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	1573	0.0285714285714285	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1818181818181818	2.568093060720685	2.4210217316585747	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned. Even more so, it's their land and they have a right to tell the oil companies NO WAY.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	127	527	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0909090909090909	2.3415918761511447	2.2459037482964286	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits.

There should be some way to easily take food or even have someone come pick it up and then the food can go to needy starving people.	joy	2.0	2.0	1.0	29.0	40000.0	5.0	5.5	2.5	6.0	3.5	3.429	3.143	3.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	61	791	0.0	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	2.940131701618672	2.8531762668630094	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 40000.0$.

3.167	5.125	I don't know if you ever owned or read a copy of National Geographic magazine but there is something interesting that has occurred in the news lately.  It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.  I really think this is unfair to me.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	47.0	32000.0	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.0	2.5	2.143	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	147	1210	0.1612903225806451	0.1290322580645161	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.1935483870967742	0.1935483870967742	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.0	2.557632323056219	2.5369590208108463	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

What gives this person the right to take someone else life? Those people may have had children, mothers, sisters, friends, co-workers, and now they are dead, and for what?  How did this individual go so long without being apprehended.  Sometimes the system really confuses me and upsets me.

I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning.

The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.

Since the report on this cruel incident is only available in my first language, Afrikaans, and on the website Netwerk24 where one has to be a paying subscriber to access their news articles, I am including a short video uploaded by the young farmer herself.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	32.0	25000.0	4.0	4.5	5.5	3.5	3.0	4.2860000000000005	3.143	3.143	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	95	1017	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.903205060255566	2.864774993312858	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

They hardly have food or water. They get no interaction so when they do need to round them up, they're mean. That should be illegal. I'm suprised he has not been caught yet.

The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp. The dismantlement operation is expected to last for a week.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	100.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	2.857	3.571	3.714	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	98	1113	0.15	0.05	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.25	0.1	0.0	0.05	0.0	2.706341691957868	2.615109213832003	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100.0$.

Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street.

What is more important however is that the father got his revenge.  Sometimes it is necessary to take justice in your own hands.  I applaud the father for what he did.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	35.0	50000.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	2.571	2.4290000000000003	3.143	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	908	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.2413793103448276	0.0344827586206896	0.1379310344827586	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.0	2.854319570798457	2.6958077645108944	medium	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I'm sure the guy must have been near a nest or something if the turtle tried to attack.  Still, should he be charged with a felony?  My Granny Jones used to make turtle soup out of the snappers they fished out of her creek.

It indicated that Trump had a simple appeal to the darker side of people, the look out for myself and not others side, it explored Trump's ability to partner with those that are hurting and feel left out of society through lack of jobs, etc.  He used this association to promote his agenda, with simple phrases that were easy to remember, and tailored it to the good old boy network.  The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	40000.0	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	101	669	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.2727272727272727	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	2.895101614352161	2.5406413421720173	medium	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

It will help the people they have harmed and seek to right the wrong and there will be justice. Wells Fargo is big and they should not harm others and the articles is well told on what happened to them and what they did in detail.

Divorce sucks but divorce sucks for everyone who I could really care less if it's a famous actress or not.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	55000.0	5.5	5.5	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.571	2.857	3.571	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	61	1533	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.410428294719542	2.2189764192022774	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

As a woman, and one who is married to a biracial man and has a biracial son, I will say, I do not fear my exsitance or my families. Even if trump is not the most respectful, he is not out to get women, people of color, etc. He is trying to do what is best for this country, and he was voted in, so we need to just get on with our lives and hope for the best.	neutral	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	1473	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1	2.741044739376251	2.716712807574286	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

6.0	1.5	The medical profession is clueless according to three articles I just read. They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	132	1023	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

They can commit acts that can be deemed a war crime but as long as they are the authority they do not need to be accounted for.	neutral	1.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	45000.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	71	817	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0714285714285714	2.821918384095537	2.748242604665358	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

4.333	4.875	"Apparently there are now a lot of wildfires in the Appalachia area, and it seems people are going to try to spin this into a ""climate change"" story. It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true.

Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.167	1.625	I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

Otherwise it’s just another sad story out of so many others like it in the world.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	70000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	1.5	7.0	4.857	1.0	1.714	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	58	251	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.1851851851851851	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.918041791394633	2.770430251087009	low	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

Hopefully they'll get it repaired soon though and things will go back to normal. At least there wasn't severe environmental damage, that's a good thing.

It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	44000.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	155	535	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.0434782608695652	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830317	medium	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

Really...just rent a hotel room when you can go. Buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a problem waiting to happen. But I can't stand how grimy the companies are and how they jerk people around. It just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people's pockets. And the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they don't want to play fair.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	943	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.0	2.544203069942621	2.5323531852857726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

She is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how grateful she is to have me as a friend. I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me.

Having to go to or being forced into sex work is bad enough, but for it to end like this is just sad. It feels like there's no place safe in this world to be a woman sometimes.	sadness	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	62	35	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0869565217391304	0.217391304347826	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.672181514426452	2.7553927804180525	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

7.0	7.0	I think that being gay is not a choice, and that we should accept these individuals no matter what. Their gayness is not hurting or affecting you in any way, so get over it. I think is natural for someone to be attracted to either sex, and we need to be more accepting of it. I wish I could hug every gay person who has ever felt like they are worth less than they are, because they are worth just as much as everyone else.	joy	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	85	1475	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.3571428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	2.734129764740418	2.709596305897397	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

Where are the parents when the kids are out there fighting and attacking people in the street. Its just disgusting. I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	97	156	0.1666666666666666	0.1944444444444444	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0666666666666666	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment. He slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase.	disgust	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	255	0.09375	0.09375	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	2.8849444849874755	3.057329181639548	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

This kind of story makes me want to go vegan.	disgust	1.0	7.0	1.0	35.0	50000.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	2.571	2.4290000000000003	3.143	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	82	910	0.1538461538461538	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.990335411546433	2.872520062209296	medium	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Perhaps neither are good, but how do we fix this?	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	73	70	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0769230769230769	2.978977904394956	2.6756163667824056	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases.

I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to shame anyone into conversion therapy. I cannot stand Mike Pence and everything he stands for.

These people are fleeing desperate conditions in hope of a better life and are attempting risky crossings because there are not enough safe ways to migrate.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	5.5	5.5	2.0	5.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	3.429	3.429	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	68	1254	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0625	2.828738780460882	2.8110443483019942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Of course we should be working to protect endangered species, but you won't be successful if you don't care for the humans involved, too. I had no idea elephants were the cause of so much misery. They should be saved, but the people who live around them must be protected as well.	joy	2.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	41000.0	4.5	7.0	3.0	6.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	2.857	4.857	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	65	1443	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	2.752304712482863	2.6278126388669145	low	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 41000.0$.

The more and more I read about him, the more and more disturbed I am to have him as a president and wish I did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots.

2.0	1.0	I do think that this male birth control for men should be a thing. Men should be able to decide if those risks are worth the protection. Men should have the ability to take birth control in their own hands, as they never know if a woman is lieing about taking her's or if they have been taking it properly. An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing. Women, get over it. If your side effects from your birth control are too strong, then just don't have sex.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1474	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1515151515151515	0.0	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.78421836330545	2.6997879597824745	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

Don't get me wrong, it's maddening."	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	55000.0	5.5	5.5	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.571	2.857	3.571	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	1532	0.1587301587301587	0.1111111111111111	0.0476190476190476	0.1746031746031746	0.0158730158730158	0.1111111111111111	0.1746031746031746	0.1428571428571428	0.0317460317460317	0.0317460317460317	0.0	2.7891765250108493	2.7595286534329526	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

I find that how America feels about it, and others around the world, is more correct, than in error. Whereby they are appalled by all the violence and blood shed. I feel personally that each party should consider the welfare of the people at large, than any self-aggrandizements, and personal power plays. It they can become more self-less, and less selfish, they will make decisions that are in the best interest and safety of the people of Yemen, aside and apart of whatever their political idealogies may be, when they are saving lives, and not just garnering votes, or political power	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	139	939	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.05	3.054537124601838	2.8769135735068083	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

1.833	5.75	Take a look at this. It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down. It may be our best shot. We could only be so lucky.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	123	1285	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0526315789473684	0.131578947368421	0.2368421052631578	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.0833333333333333	2.574960511796154	2.5223772933957065	low	low	An essay written by a 59.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500.0$.

Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate.

It may seem like racial profiling, but only Middle Easterners belong to ISIS, so it is appropriate in this case.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	36.0	20000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	5.0	6.0	3.429	2.0	2.714	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	77	391	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.6585222607571537	2.63930058523692	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	sadness	2.0	5.0	2.0	41.0	60000.0	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	81	44	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0833333333333333	2.51888015678584	2.499289970764298	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I feel really worried for animals that depend on the sea ice, polar bears I think really need it. Plus I read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and doesn't get reflected.

It brings out the selfishness of humans and their inability to share this wonderful world with its other inhabitants.

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them. Suddenly, one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist.

There seems to be a heavy smog lingering over the town that has caused a number of respiratory illnesses as well as shut down some schools.  I have just read that air quality readings have been taken from some scientists.  They found the quality of the air to be like smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day.  Yet, the local media is reporting something more like two dozen.

The only way someone should be stopped or removed from their flights is if they displayed violent behavior or if they were trying to board with weapons. It is not acceptable at all for someone to be barred from their flight due to the color of their skin or their religious or ethnic background. Those who have been discriminated against for these reasons are suffering undue embarrassment and inconvenience. They should be compensated for this unfair treatment and the airlines should be fined heavily.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1545	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.2692307692307692	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	2.930272373926084	2.893700873208173	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

3.833	5.125	So, in India there's a lot of corruption and the Prime Minister made a promise to stop it. He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks. I agree!	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	27.0	15000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	114	899	0.0652173913043478	0.0652173913043478	0.108695652173913	0.1521739130434782	0.0869565217391304	0.1956521739130435	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.0652173913043478	0.1304347826086956	0.0769230769230769	2.6207426363001964	2.510169184381482	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

1.833	1.375	I don't know if you've seen this article about the war on cops, but I found it pretty unconvincing. It actually made me a bit angry, because it focuses on police deaths form two years ago and doesn't take into account current figures. Also, by focusing on deaths alone, it completely glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is safe in the current climate. It feels a lot like fake news to me. All you have to do is pick up the paper to see how often cops are involved in fights with criminals and crazy people.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	105000.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1923076923076923	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0454545454545454	2.8774576499399567	2.7984443590899137	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000.0$.

THese people have something wrong with them and I think they bear some responsibility for their own suffering.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	103	1073	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0	2.5124364356736164	2.41214807320508	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

6.332999999999999	3.5	I'm not sure how to feel about this. We really do need to go green, but at what point do we call it green when it kills so many animals? I'm a little aghast, even though I know science needs evidence in numbers, that they are wasting money on figuring out that species that typically migrate are *gasp* being killed in places other than where they are from. Put that money towards developing something that stops the problem. We need green energy like wind and solar, so let's find a solution to make it so that we don't keep losing what we're trying to save.	surprise	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	105	944	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.1463414634146341	0.0975609756097561	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.1463414634146341	0.0	2.857866822875589	2.800110733954625	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

Apparently, the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below. Everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible tragedy it was. I feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again. You're suppose to have fun at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting hurt when you get on these rides. Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	63000.0	6.5	4.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.143	1.0	2.571	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	510	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0434782608695652	3.076003552971601	2.9289884995829376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

There is not enough room in this world for people that would do this to others for any cause or religion.  I hope that everyone that can be saved and cared for is able to get what they need in order to recover physically.  I know that the emotional healing for all of them and their families will take much more time and help for these poor people that have had to endure such an atrocity.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

Consider these unfortunate ways of rallying countries behind one cause of peace.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	66	167	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	2.7351531835791123	2.730568709058206	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

4.5	4.25	I think in this day and age, there is no reason to be poaching tigers, or any other rare game for that matter. I've discussed this with my friends before, the poachers are generally low status people, trying to feed themselves, and they're selling to the highest bidder they can find. Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation. One day, we'll look back and see all of the greed killing rare animals purposefully, rather than the crappy way we move them out of their territories naturally as humans.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	30.0	50000.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1089	0.16	0.12	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.12	0.24	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.0	2.886237767856457	2.829857670206246	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

Drescher also said that the majority of research surrounding conversion therapy has taken place on adults who’ve undergone the process, and there is very little research surrounding LGBTQ youth who have been through conversation therapy practices. “But of course you have anecdotal stories,” he said. “Some children have reported running away from home, there have been cases in the news of young people of when their family found out about them or they came out and the family insisted they go to conversion therapy	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	160000.0	4.5	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	3.429	3.429	2.714	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	130	265	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	3.164152056425312	2.953442137812333	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 160000.0$.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

Just having a shocking video that raises awareness doesn't help the problem from starting, just helps us react to it quicker.  We need to keep building programs that are designed to support our children, but we need to do it before they start to bully (or be bullied).

Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	93	1616	0.1956521739130435	0.1521739130434782	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0652173913043478	0.0652173913043478	0.217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0	2.746293485206892	2.898086076746432	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way. I can't imagine another reason than that. And the people were fine anyway.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	63000.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.714	1.286	4.428999999999999	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	850	0.238095238095238	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.2857142857142857	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	2.527182778133081	2.51467573003539	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	140	457	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

But I also do not understand why they would be so careless and wander off on a trail where it is clearly marked that they shouldnt be leaving.  If they would have paid more attention and didnt carelessly not listen to rules than this situation could have been avoided.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	24.0	50000.0	6.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.714	3.714	4.857	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	228	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.980421178026604	2.9594534228220577	medium	medium	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 50000.0$.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

5.0	4.5	"These pellet guns almost seem like they were meant to maim individuals, under the guise of a less-lethal round. The fact that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more damage, more permanent damage, seems to back that up. It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity? It's confusing, because I can't think of any reason other than harm someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the case here."	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	48000.0	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	1209	0.1627906976744186	0.1395348837209302	0.0	0.0697674418604651	0.0	0.1162790697674418	0.2325581395348837	0.1627906976744186	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0	2.679497452773476	2.698839484602791	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000.0$.

Some do not appreciate the dangers of mother nature and try to best her without realizing what they are up against. It is always important to prepare before you go out on a hike. Without understanding what you are doing, a person could easily end up lost or dead.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	25000.0	6.0	5.5	4.5	6.5	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	3.714	4.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	410	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	3.116728935444729	2.889908237916299	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	111	1619	0.1162790697674418	0.1395348837209302	0.0465116279069767	0.0232558139534883	0.0465116279069767	0.0930232558139534	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.1162790697674418	0.0465116279069767	0.0	2.425378731837707	2.480071312673714	low	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

1.5	1.75	I read an article about using the Internet and computers in the classroom, and how it affects kids. The article mainly talked about E-rate, a government program to subsidize the Internet and broadband access. It said that most classrooms are now connected, but the millions of dollars are still being spent. The program seemed to be wasting a lot of money and wasn't showing good results. I agree that just buying computers and being on the Internet doesn't guarantee that kids are receiving a good education.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	21600.0	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	86	1237	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.6295257813501838	2.487605835112237	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600.0$.

There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going.

We are in danger of either paying really high prices on coffee or worse case scenario being without coffee period. This is very distressing for me.

Since she is stronger, she will survive, then they can bring her back to complete health, then do it again for the next 3 years, then keep repeating it until she dies. I can't comprehend why people like this do these things, but there is a special place in hell. I don't buy the mental illness garbage. OF COURSE she has a mental illness, but that shouldn't automatically imply protection from justice.

I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

Hopefully this will be the next piece in a long line of information pushing us towards vegetarianism.	surprise	1.0	4.0	1.0	20.0	350000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	3.5	3.0	3.857	2.4290000000000003	4.0	3.286	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	293	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.3888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.6743407660088434	2.682622630142076	low	low	An essay written by a 20.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 350000.0$.

I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again?

But by its end, Raphael tells “Oprah: Where Are They Now?” that her series had devolved into a show of salacious content and tabloid fodder like some of her talk-show peers, and she was not happy about it this makes a bad ending	sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	75000.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	2.5	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.286	3.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	83	439	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.1666666666666666	2.4270509364390724	2.133297331522929	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

1.0	2.875	I read this article about what black people think. It is crazy that they still believe they are being targeted by the police. Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here. Let them try living back in Africa and see how they like that.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	63.0	35000.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	116	752	0.1818181818181818	0.1136363636363636	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.2045454545454545	0.1818181818181818	0.0227272727272727	0.0	0.0	2.893788157080626	2.823569269494842	medium	medium	An essay written by a 63.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000.0$.

The ISIS fighters were certainly brutal towards their victims, and have captured many more to use as human shields or to kill outright for their perceived beliefs.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	30000.0	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	79	1350	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.858802959852571	2.793739728464708	medium	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

However, it's also overflowing with this self-centered ignorance that our internet culture has engendered over the last decade. We are specks, even on this planet, even in our own cities.  It's an enormous world--unfathomably large.  To think that it is not irrational to be afraid of terrorism is stupid.  Statistically speaking--i.e. RATIONALLY speaking--it is absurd to be afraid of terrorism.  And yet intelligent people are.  They see the world too much through their phones, through the images (images, not tangible things) depicted on it.  The world that exists in our phones does not exist in reality.  They are two distinct things.

Shows are cancelled all the time, so I get kind of annoyed with this kind of news.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	55.0	10000.0	6.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	6.0	3.571	2.0	3.571	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	729	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.05	0.2	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.0	2.7194280888162163	2.5984182552643174	low	low	An essay written by a 55.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 10000.0$.

But if they believe the police are the ones who handed them over to a drug cartel, then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	89	1121	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.95893284074278	2.974448426322971	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

There seems to be only circumstantial evidence against the accused and the media is overblowing the story which can really detract from finding the truth!  The victim here is being overshadowed by the gawker phenomenon.  It's sad.  I mean, even the premise sounds... fishy... but instead of talking about that, it looks like it's being sensationalized into some media circus.  It's terrible.  How can they ever get to the truth if the story is corrupted and broadcast to the whole country?	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	47.0	26000.0	4.5	7.0	2.5	7.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	1248	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.611209310900389	2.656517747811677	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 26000.0$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

My heart goes out to these people because they deserve to live in peace on this Earth and be healthy and prosperous just like everyone else. Such a blatant disregard for human life! India is like hell in Earth. I would lock up these government people in solitary confinement for life and let the fly ash befall on their heads so they can find out what getting tuberculosis and liver decease is like for these poor people!  The situation in India just never ends, makes you wonder where all these mega wealthy Indian royals are?!!!

In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?   I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.  The guy that the story is about is serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking and assaulting a corrections officer.  This prison is known as the toughest prison and I can see why.

2.167	3.875	It aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an opportunity to lead. It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	1286	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

I just hate Trump and everything about him as well as his supporters.	anger	2.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	40000.0	4.0	4.0	1.0	6.0	2.5	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	70	1389	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	2.8798014014936717	2.8469840010681	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, went to college, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.6669999999999998	1.625	Trump should really not underestimate the blacks. They got complacent after two Obama terms, and didn't come out in force like they should have for the election. Now that Trump is in office, I don't think there's any way he can win the black vote, and that would definitely sway the election in 2020. I really think Trump's days are numbered, whether it's impeachment or defeat in the next election.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	36.0	20000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	5.0	6.0	3.429	2.0	2.714	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	70	394	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.3125	0.125	0.0	0.0625	0.0	2.5294073351197026	2.4228605011876017	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

And let's face it America's hands aren't clean in the middle east, or Africa. America has learned nothing from past wars. We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral.

I know some people will say it is not a person, but this is still another needless murder that occurred because of a gun.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	79	129	0.2105263157894736	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.713066034113119	2.8833205455470416	low	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.
