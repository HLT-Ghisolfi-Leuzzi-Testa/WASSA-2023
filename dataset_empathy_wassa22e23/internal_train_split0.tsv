6.833333333333333	6.625	The whole article broke my heart. If I got a text message telling me I have 24 hours to leave my home and all the things that I own, I would not know what to do. Of course I would leave with my wife and children because they are the most important things in my life, but it would be hard to know my house is about to get bombed. Also, paying 40 dollars for a kilogram of meat, I could not afford this and I do not live in a war tore country. I hate this for the people.	sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	100	1805	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.2857142857142857	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.0	2.8076429798639464	2.6726193292736924	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

5.833333333333333	5.75	After reading an article on the consequences of Donald Trump's election, it's clear that Islamophobia has surged. The impact of his extensive judicial appointments has set our country on a downward trajectory, causing long-lasting harm. It is my earnest wish that greater attention is given to the corruption and urgent requirement for a transformative overhaul of American politics during his tenure.	hope	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	61	2257	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.3117200381277523	2.1020599466475893	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

I'm happy to see so many people speaking out and making issues with PTSD more easy to talk about. We can't keep ignoring these issues and pretending that we just can't do anything for our vets.

I think we often take water for granted in the US (or at least, in parts of the US), so we don't think about how precious it is.

6.0	6.0	This article was a little hard to follow as I dont follow or know much about whats going on in the other side of the world. It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance. Something needs to be done to help.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	131	1728	0.16	0.04	0.08	0.08	0.04	0.24	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.9662714617149524	2.840008237173438	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I know we always or mostly mean well but this story amply displayed how when we interfere with natural order of things even with the best of intentions, we can make the matters worse. People were inadvertently spreading the virus beyond the natural reach of infected frog population which in turn was destroying other harmless and healthy frog groups.

1.0	5.625	The article is misguided in many ways, and obviously only prevents one perspective on all of these very complicated issues.  I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.  Entitlement doesn't produce better outcomes; it produces more entitlement.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	122	1573	0.0285714285714285	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1818181818181818	2.568093060720685	2.4210217316585747	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

2.167	7.0	Gay conversion therapy is terrible! I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to shame anyone into conversion therapy. I cannot stand Mike Pence and everything he stands for. He probably is a strong advocate because he is probably closeted! Why can't people just be ok with who they are?

Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

Sometimes I still cannot believe that we lived through 9/11, especially because before that I had never even heard the word terrorism or knew what a terrorist attack was. And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people.

6.0	6.0	I have compassion for both sides in this situation. The police and the local population are both attempting to protect the sacred wildlife and its creatures, while the village likely requires the animal's meat or the funds from its sale, given their extreme poverty. I can imagine the desperation that might arise in a third-world country, where it would seem like the police are depriving them of their sole source of livelihood. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely striving to safeguard and do what is morally right. They don't deserve to be subjected to such a violent attack, and I'm surprised they managed to survive such a brutal beating. I hope that more actions are taken to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	124	2241	0.18	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.06	0.2	0.14	0.08	0.04	0.02	0.08	2.9351966297555325	2.836919471871327	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I think this happens with any president I know many whites were afraid of obama being in office and only serving african americans and same here they believe trump only will help out upper white class. But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating. Also, I think it is right that more of the illigal immigrants should be worried as he directly said he is going after them which is just since they are breaking out us laws. 	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	127	1915	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1621621621621621	0.2432432432432432	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.0526315789473684	2.801976524926112	2.785634044839004	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

7.0	1.375	I think it's so rude when people mock government officials and get so full of them selves over politics. It really just burns me up that people can't get along in regards to it.  I hate reading about politics in general and it is even worse when you have to read about grown adults bickering  and arguing over it all.  Joe Walsh and Diana Duckworth both are very immature.

3.333333333333333	6.75	This is all disgusting and makes me wonder how anyone could have sympathy or pause for battling militant Islam head-on.  These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.  These Arabs and Persians are just so passive and impotent with their overlords.	anger/disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	2054	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0	2.5408346036547678	2.471799664988035	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

The parents and the children got out safe and they didn't die and they didn't get maimed or even scratced as far as I can tell but their two cats died and they lost their home. I am a cat owner and they are always ""skitished"" and afraid so my first thought is how terrified they must have been and then how awful the children must feel.

BOTH sides need to be held accountable for their actions and the divide they are creating in this country.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	7.0	3.5	2.0	4.5	4.5	3.857	3.0	3.714	3.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	1359	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0769230769230769	2.653750256549198	2.724894134965422	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

And obviously the authorities, who do nothing and allow this to go on.  But what about the families who keep having children they feel obligated to send to work at age 11 and 12?  Stop having children you can't feed.  These countries are all grossly overpopulated but they keep having kids.

I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.

They say he did something bad to her but I bet he was trying to flirt with her as well.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	37.0	50000.0	4.5	5.0	5.5	5.5	3.5	3.714	2.714	3.571	3.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	75	1270	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.125	2.557693457021143	2.444444641306646	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

It is not a trivial matter and significantly affects people's sense of vulnerability. The perils associated with war are genuinely dangerous, prompting a reconsideration of the decision to enlist. It is imperative that we prioritize research efforts to gain a deeper understanding of PTSD and work towards improved outcomes for individuals affected by it.	hope/neutral	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	73	2265	0.1904761904761904	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.238095238095238	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0666666666666666	2.713441316551992	2.5199430425458083	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

The United States has had military influence in the Middle East for way too long, and we were deceived by President Obama at the time he started office. He stated he would pull all troops out, but that never really happened.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	2017	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0434782608695652	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.167	1.375	There is no way the FBI or any government agency could figure out what a lone wolf terrorist was going to do. Some terrorist could walk into anywhere and just start shooting the place up. It's terrible what the United States has become. The only way I see to limit terrorism is to try and limit immigration into the country, but even that doesn't solve things. Seems like if you don't live the right kind of life to someone, whether it's being gay etc., then somebody tries to hurt you.

6.0	6.0	There were numerous aspects of this article that deeply troubled me. I cannot fathom experiencing what this girl went through because I would never expect my parents to subject me to such circumstances. It's astonishing that they have been released from jail, as they appear to pose a significant threat to society by perpetrating such acts against their own child. It is my fervent hope that these individuals never come into contact with another innocent child. As parents, our primary duty is to safeguard our children, and this girl can never reclaim her lost childhood. It is difficult to comprehend how she could ever trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such trauma. Her mental state must be profoundly affected, and I genuinely wish for her to receive the necessary support.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	133	2254	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0384615384615384	3.1123587064547973	3.09501349531376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.75	Donald Trump's anti-minority rhetoric has to stop. He has stirred up those who are Islamophobic and has put people in grave danger. That is not how a leader should act. And banning Muslims from entering the United States is very unfair. This situation makes me so mad. Many of the Muslims who wish to come to the US are doing so to keep their families safe, but in fact, it is becoming less safe for them here.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	77	1544	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	2.4661997811438368	2.475700854719576	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

It seems like it was a tough call because we are there allies and the us soldiers should have followed protocol by stopping.If it was a miscommunication I hope they take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again as fighting and killing eachother is a waste that needs to be for the bad guys. I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier. I wonder if it was a miscommunication or somehow the soldiers flipped into that bad guys. Either way I hope a full investigaton is done to try and prevent anything of this nature from happening in the future. 	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	123	1958	0.1395348837209302	0.1395348837209302	0.0697674418604651	0.0465116279069767	0.0697674418604651	0.0697674418604651	0.1860465116279069	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0465116279069767	0.0833333333333333	2.898891089716315	2.8007488845402047	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Everyone hates on women getting involved in anything men ""own"" like comic books and Ghostbusters. Its ridiculous. She was targeted by all the incels online and they're the angriest vilest group to deal with. I hope she just writes a different series and keeps going. She doesn't need a twitter account.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

I say stupid because ignorance is simply not having a lack of intelligence or something, but you're still willing to educate yourself or be educated on it.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

5.5	4.875	The artical also Trump campaign was unprecedented in its dishonesty; the fact that the lies didn’t exact a political price, that they even resonated with a large bloc of voters, doesn’t make them any less false. No, our inner cities aren’t war zones with record crime. No, we aren’t the highest-taxed nation in the world. No, climate change isn’t a hoax promoted by the Chinese.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened.

4.167	4.5	Even though the situation is hard to watch, I am glad that more and more people are standing up to racism. This is a problem that many deny is even still a problem. It is uncomfortable to see the divide that these situations shine a light on but in the end it is for the greater good. There needs to be major reforms in the policing sector that will eliminate the racial profiling that goes on but I am afraid that more hard will come before the good.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	30.0	30000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	88	1553	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1	0.0666666666666666	2.7654963336202525	2.768946218107315	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 30000.0$.

It is heartbreaking to see people fight for land they love it, and it’s heartbreaking for the police to have to shoot people over it. people lose years of their lives in prison over land and cattle and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted in court cases. the whole article was a mess!	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	30000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.143	3.857	4.571000000000001	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	148	1293	0.1764705882352941	0.1568627450980392	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0196078431372549	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.0784313725490196	0.0588235294117647	0.0392156862745098	0.0	3.121228650029198	2.9456770444719145	medium	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 30000.0$.

By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.	neutral	1.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	45000.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	108	820	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.861190685362936	2.84778427910004	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

7.0	7.0	I read an article about how islamic militants have rounded up civilians and used them for shields. There has been a lot of death happening in the middle east. Could you imagine what it would be like to live in one of those countries? The people must live their lives in constant fear. I wonder what the average life span is for someone living in one of these countries. I believe that they should do away with immigration laws and let whoever wants to come to America, come to America. There is no way to justify what these people are faced with daily. They should not have to live their lives in fear everyday.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	6.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	114	1483	0.1875	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.892384940081347	2.852759655836813	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	anger/neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	134	2152	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Schoolyard bullies are invigorated by the Bully-in-Chief every day he remains in the spotlight.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	37.0	30000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	7.0	4.714	1.429	4.2860000000000005	4.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	1447	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.516960851852505	2.478598367333048	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

This kind of narrative is truly what the modern liberal exists upon. It's disgusting.

1.833	1.375	I don't know if you've seen this article about the war on cops, but I found it pretty unconvincing. It actually made me a bit angry, because it focuses on police deaths form two years ago and doesn't take into account current figures. Also, by focusing on deaths alone, it completely glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is safe in the current climate. It feels a lot like fake news to me. All you have to do is pick up the paper to see how often cops are involved in fights with criminals and crazy people.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	105000.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1384	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1923076923076923	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0454545454545454	2.8774576499399567	2.7984443590899137	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000.0$.

3.833	5.875	I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	132	1023	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

2.5	3.25	"So I just had to read this article for a survey. It was completely unformatted, an enormous text-wall essay list. I made it all the way through though. I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot. I think that's kinda weird that something like that was even included in an article with feminist tone."	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	27.0	15000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	139	897	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.4117647058823529	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0357142857142857	2.482067050265856	2.2223396177554178	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

They are trying to hold them accountable for the needless and cruel slaughter of wild animals. I forgot the name of the group. But I hope they stop them.

6.0	6.0	I feel so sorry for the passengers and victims onboard. This would be my worst fear being on a train or plain having no control or way out of such a big accident. They must have been so afraid once the train started rocking back and forth. I wonder what actually caused this horrible accident in the first place. They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected. It seems to be a totally avoidable way to lose a life and needs to have more security measures put into place.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	124	2084	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.0	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.0	2.9275548134373968	2.9908286314467967	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I really hope this guy gets caught.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	21.0	45000.0	5.5	6.5	2.5	6.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	1.857	3.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	873	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1379310344827586	0.0689655172413793	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0689655172413793	0.1538461538461538	2.719907331153744	2.911654186582832	medium	medium	An essay written by a 21.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

3.667	6.625	It never ceases to amaze me that things like this as still occurring. They want to roll back regulations when things like this happened because there were none and now kids have to pay the price, but they are kids of color so they dont matter.  Remember this, Flint still does not have clean water years later.  The government is corrupt and the cancer starts in the Oval office and runs through his swamp.  Its time to get these people out of office and to punish the companies and people that have allowed this to happened to the innocent children of America.

I have never worked at a bank before, but being told to reach a quota, even by the means of doing illegal tasks to accomplish what they needed to do. I can't imagine coming into working everyday and wondering if I was going to be considered a good or a bad employee. It would infuriate me to have earned a bonus and then be told I cannot have it because I am being developed as an employee. I am glad they decided to make the change.

6.0	6.0	This type of article deeply resonates with me. It underscores the urgent need to protect and closely monitor older individuals, as these incidents occur far too frequently. Numerous seniors suffer from dementia, rendering them unaware of their surroundings and highly prone to becoming lost. Contemplating the possibility of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sadness. The image of them wandering, without a coat, feeling cold and frightened, is absolutely heart-wrenching. I am immensely grateful that the officers located her before any harm befell her. My hope is that she can be promptly reunited with her family, and that comprehensive safeguards are implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring. It may be beneficial for the family to consider additional support options, such as a group home, to ensure her well-being and provide the necessary assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	140	2247	0.1333333333333333	0.0222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.1777777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0222222222222222	0.0444444444444444	0.0769230769230769	2.963389717656195	2.8083628941152767	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.333	3.75	Global warming is real. The effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us. The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	36.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	162	881	0.1578947368421052	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0263157894736842	0.0303030303030303	3.074889281869577	2.774841346826427	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I feel personally that each party should consider the welfare of the people at large, than any self-aggrandizements, and personal power plays.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

I am not certain about the suggestion that wild bananas be used to produce new variations, tho. I have a hunch that this would drive the cost of bananas up, which is concerning.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself, I find this article deeply unsettling. Despite the multitude of movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women in America, it is disheartening that we have not yet achieved the top spot in all aspects of gender equality. In my opinion, one of the reasons why fewer women are working or reaching senior positions is the societal judgment faced by hardworking women who prioritize their careers over having children. Furthermore, the fact that women, on average, earn only 50 percent of what men do indicates that we still live in a predominantly male-oriented world, providing little motivation to strive for higher positions. However, I believe that by placing a stronger focus on girls' education and promoting their involvement in STEM subjects, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in fields like math, science, and technology, where women's participation is currently lacking. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	160	2244	0.0	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.3529411764705882	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.1470588235294117	0.1071428571428571	2.756987282125528	2.681454298686307	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

7.0	2.5	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day.

It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	34999.0	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	82	1994	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1111111111111111	0.1851851851851851	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0833333333333333	2.7043999710322	2.709126651369151	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 34999.0$.

Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.

2.167	3.875	It aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an opportunity to lead. It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	1286	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

I am very cocerned because they said so many communities are effected what is this doing to the children who are growing up on this water.

6.0	6.0	I find articles like this incredibly relatable. It truly emphasizes the importance of safeguarding and closely monitoring older individuals, as this type of situation is unfortunately quite common. Many seniors endure the challenges of dementia, leaving them disoriented and highly susceptible to getting lost. The mere thought of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sorrow. Imagining them wandering aimlessly, without a coat, feeling cold and terrified, is truly heartbreaking. I feel an immense sense of gratitude towards the officers who found her before any unfortunate incidents occurred. My sincerest wish is for her to be swiftly reunited with her family, and for effective preventive measures to be established, ensuring that such incidents never happen again. Perhaps, given the circumstances, the family might consider seeking additional support, such as a group home, to provide the necessary care and assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	144	2246	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.2558139534883721	0.1860465116279069	0.1395348837209302	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0714285714285714	3.054081726553815	2.873029219740168	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I wonder if he died right away or if he suffered a lot before dying. Rangers tried to recover the mans body after the mans sister called and reported the accident. They believe that the extreme heat and the acidic liquid completely disolved the body and there was nothing left. That is wild to even think about, I have never heard of such an accident in my life.	surprise	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	6.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	100	1484	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.707156223889108	2.6994121312323864	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

4.0	4.0	I was not connected to anyone after reading the article on Aleppo and the horrible circumstances that the elderly face after the destruction wrought on the city. I was told by the System to enter the code after the survey so I completed the survey and answered with all neutral answers. The instructions said that I would get paid if I somehow was not connected with anyone (i.e. if they disconnected). I guess in this situation they did in fact disconnect. I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so. War tears cities apart, and it is hard for me to understand how so many innocent people suffer due to the whims of those in power. I hope to get paid for my efforts.

1.0	6.75	I struggle to grasp the rationale behind individuals choosing to travel to Norway with the aim of disrupting the natural habitat of polar bears. At times, human reasoning baffles me. My fervent wish is for people to simply let the polar bears and other animals be, granting them the opportunity to live their lives undisturbed, just as humans do. I harbor optimism that the population of polar bears will one day rebound to its original state.	hope	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	76	2249	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	3.040272755449834	2.835958774650616	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.

Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

It is my sincere hope that more individuals become aware of the corruption and recognize the imperative need to revolutionize American politics under his administration.	hope	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	60	2258	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	2.638920290581766	2.5230933513495195	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

People are becoming too short-fused and trigger happy on attacking others with hate crimes. I hope things get better but the article didn't seem too optimistic. I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored.

Imagine how their families feel.  It is so cruel for other students to bully each other and be cruel to each other.  It is so very unnecessary and why treat people that way?  Why not do unto others as you would have the do unto you?

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.

5.0	3.125	I find myself in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed in this article. It has shed light on a perspective that had not previously crossed my mind: the abundance of young minds in places like zzos and theme parks who should not be exposed to smoking. In my opinion, cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, with restrictions on public consumption. When children witness others smoking, they internalize it as the norm and socially acceptable behavior. By shielding the current generation from such influences, we can lay the foundation for them to make better choices and prioritize their health in the future. The proposed ban holds a real possibility of reducing the number of potential new smokers and eradicating the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I wholeheartedly support this ban and believe it will have no negative consequences if implemented.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	142	2268	0.0	0.0	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.2962962962962963	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0344827586206896	2.568658326668702	2.509329733274858	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This article is truly heart-wrenching. It is challenging to come to terms with the plight of individuals in different parts of the world. The fact that people would abandon their parents and elderly relatives during times of war is beyond comprehension. Additionally, the scarcity of food in their homes exacerbates the situation. They constantly face attacks and lack access to basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My earnest desire is for the cessation of wars and for these individuals to receive the necessary assistance to rebuild their lives and homes. It is crucial to prioritize greater efforts in donating to charities that aid these regions. While I can understand why some would be hesitant to travel and reside there, given the high risk of death from airstrikes, the least these people should have is access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	146	2221	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.119047619047619	0.0238095238095238	0.2142857142857142	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	3.109474679825728	2.8650273029390023	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

There are only so many things that can be done to prepare for something like this and most of the time the preparations only mitigate minimal damage.

They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up.

2.0	3.875	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.

Yes, it's cruel and seems to be brutal but at the same time it could be a good way of discouraging people to commit such crimes. On the other hand a victim's situation will not be improved or reversed because their perpetrator has been harmed in the same way.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	37.0	72000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	67	1230	0.1785714285714285	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0833333333333333	2.607597671774005	2.7896595154919823	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

7.0	1.125	I am writing to you in response to an article I just read about Nevada and the water supply. It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	138	940	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.3928571428571428	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.6999825947228584	2.461963714232384	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

5.0	5.0	This article serves as a stark reminder of the realities we face. It highlights the fallibility of scientific understanding and the vast amount of knowledge that remains elusive to us. It is disconcerting to realize that these animals were previously unaware carriers of the disease, and now there is a possibility that genetic mutations have caused its spread among their population. The suffering endured by these creatures is undeniably heart-wrenching, with no means for them to alleviate their pain. I sincerely hope that further research is conducted to identify ways to halt the disease's progression before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I am grateful for the conservationist who brought attention to this issue, prompting others to voice their concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	123	2230	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0638297872340425	0.1276595744680851	0.0425531914893617	0.2127659574468085	0.1702127659574468	0.1063829787234042	0.0851063829787234	0.0425531914893617	0.032258064516129	2.8717645779290875	2.759347575690394	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This article is incredibly distressing. Reading about the struggles endured by individuals in other parts of the world is profoundly disheartening. It is unfathomable to think that people would forsake their parents and elderly family members during times of war. To compound matters, their homes lack sufficient food, leaving them in a dire situation. They face constant attacks and are deprived of basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My sincerest hope is for an end to these wars, allowing these people to receive the assistance needed to rebuild their lives and homes. Donating to charities dedicated to helping these regions requires heightened efforts. While I understand the hesitation some may feel about traveling and living there, given the high likelihood of death from airstrikes, it is imperative that these individuals at least have access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	145	2222	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.048780487804878	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.1951219512195122	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.073170731707317	0.0344827586206896	3.1115116042551176	2.900474509340724	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

It is essential that we invest in research to understand and address this issue, with the hope of achieving better outcomes for those affected.	hope/neutral	1.0	6.0	2.0	32.0	35000.0	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	71	2264	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0714285714285714	2.899574741582584	2.672839838099685	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

Men should have the ability to take birth control in their own hands, as they never know if a woman is lieing about taking her's or if they have been taking it properly. An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing. Women, get over it.

The people of the cruise and the police also allege that this couple was discussing a moment before the accident happened.	neutral	1.0	5.0	1.0	23.0	53000.0	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	85	960	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.1818181818181818	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.5624908126456045	2.432278510252764	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 53000.0$.

Innocent people are dying as well as getting killed. Families of these people are all grieving that they just lost a family member. Overall, it's terrible that this is still going on in the world today and there's nothing we can do about it.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	78	1684	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.238095238095238	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	3.075209032338521	2.8558480455540454	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

5.0	3.125	This article resonates strongly with me, as it introduces a perspective I wholeheartedly endorse. It hadn't occurred to me before how locations like zzos and theme parks can be teeming with young individuals who should not be exposed to smoking. I believe that treating cigarettes similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is not allowed, is a sensible approach. When children observe others smoking, they perceive it as the norm and acceptable behavior. Shielding this generation from such influences can empower them to make better choices in the future and lead healthier lives. By implementing this proposed ban, we have a genuine opportunity to decrease the number of potential new smokers and eliminate the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am fully supportive of this ban and see no negative repercussions from its enforcement.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	135	2267	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.4074074074074074	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	2.601544240108423	2.6075093429763534	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

They need to have a meeting with leaders and figure things out diplomatically. I think war is just to tossed around over there when you have innocent victims and civilians being killed. They need to do things like trump be firm and have sanctions build walls but dont rely on iolence to get your way. The fact that the cease fire was broken and both sides have nuclear weapons scares me, that there is no line that they can not cross or break.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714									116	2402	0.2	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.12	0.0	0.04	0.0526315789473684	2.8881034482854777	2.7956355032306264	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000$.

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them. Suddenly, one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist.

It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I am deeply troubled by this article. Despite the progress made through various movements, awareness efforts, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading the way in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that the decreasing number of women in the workforce or in senior positions is a result of the societal pressure on women who work hard but choose not to have children. Additionally, the persisting gender pay gap, with women earning an average of 50 percent less than men, creates little motivation to strive for higher positions. By focusing more on girls' education and encouraging their participation in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in mathematics, science, and technology, which are areas where many women currently lack representation. The future instills hope in me that my gender will succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	146	2243	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.28125	0.09375	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.074074074074074	2.7804005154514253	2.7385652984624067	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going.

There are some countries that are for the poaching of elephants if you can believe it. Some more rural communities say that the animals harm their crops. I've never heard this side of the argument before! I'm not saying I agree with it, but we're over here in America and have a way different perspective on the issues.

1.0	1.25	This story basically didn't bother me at all, except for the fact that the media seemed to unnecessarily conflate the shooting with the election, even when they later admit that the shooting had nothing to do with the election. There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.  I have no idea what this shooting was and honestly do not care.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	1966	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0	0.0	2.3974494665295736	2.3465556227951136	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

It pretty much sounds like someone with a mental health issue is running around crazy with a gun. It is nice to know so many nonprofits are not only engaged in finding this criminal, but also to prevent this from happening again, I think the adult horses  were in better shape and that's why they survived. What kind of lazy loon would mutilate the little horse's genitals?	surprise	2.0	5.0	1.0	57.0	28000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.0	3.857	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	91	1179	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1351351351351351	0.0	0.1351351351351351	0.1891891891891892	0.081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.0526315789473684	2.7588976795389626	2.700486610523377	low	low	An essay written by a 57.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It featured a woman who lived in the UK and held the remarkable position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What struck me was the astonishing fact that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It is truly remarkable to envision running an entire magazine at such an early stage in life. However, her existence was plagued by a lifelong struggle with depression, which she openly addressed in a book. Battling her mental health issues, she sought help and was admitted to a mental hospital. Tragically, despite being cleared by the hospital, she chose to walk into the ocean and met a heartbreaking fate. The lack of adequate assistance she received is truly saddening. I sincerely hope that all our friends know that we are here for them, providing unwavering support no matter what challenges they may be confronting.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	158	2235	0.0816326530612244	0.0204081632653061	0.1020408163265306	0.1632653061224489	0.0816326530612244	0.2244897959183673	0.1020408163265306	0.1020408163265306	0.0	0.1224489795918367	0.0303030303030303	2.976623179569859	2.817444701762269	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate.

3.0	4.5	You know one thing late Thursday that the Islamic State used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq. The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	1400	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.

6.0	6.0	This article evoked profound distress on multiple levels. I find it impossible to empathize with the girl in question because I could never envision my parents subjecting me to such a situation. The fact that her parents have been released from jail is truly unsettling, as their actions indicate a clear threat to society, especially considering they committed these acts against their own child. It is my sincere hope that these individuals never cross paths with another innocent child. Protecting one's children is an inherent responsibility, and it is disheartening to acknowledge that this girl can never regain her stolen childhood. The aftermath of such an ordeal would undoubtedly shatter one's trust in others and make living a normal life a formidable challenge. I pray that she receives the necessary assistance she needs to heal.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	135	2255	0.1267605633802817	0.1126760563380281	0.056338028169014	0.1126760563380281	0.0704225352112676	0.1549295774647887	0.1549295774647887	0.0985915492957746	0.028169014084507	0.0845070422535211	0.0625	2.928614356139758	2.8882576701593954	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It is my fervent hope that his parents can find peace and serenity as they move forward in life.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	84	2216	0.06	0.04	0.08	0.14	0.08	0.16	0.16	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.125	2.864910330787957	2.869754203638161	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

Plastic in the ocean gets coated with algae which emits a sulfur smell that some seabirds love. Pretty crazy, right? Anyway, it's sad what we're doing to our environment. It's sadder that we are pretty powerless to do anything about it. It's only a matter of time before everything justs collapses on itself. But at least we'll have iphones so we can video record the Apocalypse.	sadness	1.0	7.0	5.0	41.0	64000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.571	2.143	3.429	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1704	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.0714285714285714	2.347769514353457	2.286364785686045	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000.0$.

1.0	1.0	I honestly find this article more amusing than anything.  I absolutely loathe birds.  Can't stand them.  Want them all dead.  I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.

3.5	5.5	The article is profoundly heartbreaking. It is truly difficult to read about the plight of people in other parts of the world. The fact that some individuals would abandon their parents and elderly family members amidst the chaos of war is beyond comprehension. To make matters worse, their homes are devoid of sufficient food supplies, leaving them in a state of extreme vulnerability. They face incessant attacks and are unable to obtain even basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My utmost hope is for the cessation of these wars and for these people to receive the necessary assistance in rebuilding their lives and homes. It is vital to dedicate more effort to donating to charities that actively support these areas. While I understand the reluctance of some to travel and reside there, considering the high probability of death from airstrikes, it is essential that these individuals, at the very least, have access to fundamental necessities such as food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	166	2223	0.1509433962264151	0.0377358490566037	0.0754716981132075	0.0943396226415094	0.0377358490566037	0.1886792452830188	0.1886792452830188	0.1320754716981132	0.0377358490566037	0.0566037735849056	0.024390243902439	3.025683770249182	2.842196325336194	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	113	1283	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.3478260869565217	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.217391304347826	0.1428571428571428	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156656	low	low	An essay written by a 59.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500.0$.

6.0	6.0	My sympathies extend to both sides in this situation. The authorities and the local population are both driven by different motives: safeguarding the invaluable wildlife and its habitats, versus the villagers' potential reliance on the animal for sustenance or income due to their impoverished circumstances. I can envision the extreme desperation one might feel in a developing nation, where it could appear that law enforcement is depriving or confiscating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely attempting to safeguard and uphold what they believe to be just. They certainly don't deserve to endure such a vicious assault, and it astonishes me that they managed to survive such a merciless thrashing. I sincerely hope that greater efforts are made to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	130	2239	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	0.1904761904761904	0.0238095238095238	0.2619047619047619	0.1666666666666666	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0666666666666666	2.852581034531611	2.6664287201571537	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	disgust/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	128	2042	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.1724137931034483	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0909090909090909	2.611000319206454	2.4650590113548265	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I harbor profound sadness for the victims and the victims' families. They were simply performing their job duties when this reckless explosion, which could have been prevented, tragically snatched away their lives. It is disheartening to know that despite being aware of the lethal and unsafe working conditions, the authorities have yet to take the necessary steps to shut down such operations. While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life. At present, families are left without their sons, fathers, and sources of income, all of which could have been avoided through a simple shutdown. I fervently hope for enhanced working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	148	2208	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.175438596491228	0.0526315789473684	0.2456140350877192	0.1403508771929824	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.032258064516129	2.938415829895253	2.8967542206162515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

7.0	1.5	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents. I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

2.0	3.125	This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either.	anger/fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	2194	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.354431713055995	2.2336064560366857	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It must have been a terrible and very scary way to die to be trapped in that well shaft for four days.  Also, the parents must have been beside themselves, I mean can you imagine?  It just sounds completely horrific and with such a terrible ending too.  It would have been much different if they had been able to rescue him but clearly that was not possible.

More should be done to aid these animals and get help, more protocal if you see an animal like this to help stop it from spreading the disease.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	86	2079	0.1951219512195122	0.1463414634146341	0.0975609756097561	0.0	0.073170731707317	0.024390243902439	0.1951219512195122	0.1463414634146341	0.1219512195121951	0.0	0.0	3.257934290837172	3.173511091910324	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

That river will never be the same and there is nothing anyone can do now but wait and hope that someday, things might be better. But now all those people are without water and work. Generations of fisherman can't fish there. Fish isn't safe to eat.

I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	155	1072	0.0357142857142857	0.0178571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.0178571428571428	0.25	0.1607142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.125	0.0	3.012018933955341	2.864087843745476	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently read a captivating yet deeply sorrowful article. It centered around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed role of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What astounded me was that she assumed this significant responsibility at the tender age of thirty. The remarkable feat of running an entire magazine at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring. However, her life was marred by a lifelong battle with depression, which she bravely chronicled in a book. Despite seeking help and being admitted to a mental hospital, she tragically chose to end her life by walking into the ocean. The fact that she did not receive the essential support she needed is truly devastating. I earnestly hope that all our friends are aware of our unwavering presence and support, no matter the challenges they may be facing.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	142	2234	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.1666666666666666	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0238095238095238	0.119047619047619	0.0666666666666666	2.87685812876358	2.729225671010066	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp.

3.5	3.375	I totally get this in a lot of ways. I used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the mouth over Obama being elected, and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending RIGHT NOW because a black man was in the white house. Now...I don't know. I see my friends and family freaking out and I want to tell them to just chill out. Obama didn't destroy America--the right wingers were wrong about that. Neither will Trump. Life will keep going. It brings a lot of stress listening to people freaking out all the time. And yet, I get it. I get why they are worried and freaking out. I don't like it either, but I don't get the point of stressing out so much. But then again, I've completely dissociated from all this. I don't really read the news anymore.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	148	941	0.0	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.3076923076923077	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.536251605086752	2.4856735630246485	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

2.333	4.0	I'm no parent and I completely believe Donald Trump is a horrible man. With that being said, I don't think it is correct to shun your child from having a different belief as you. Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me. It worries me that the child will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for fear of upsetting their parent.	disgust	2.0	6.0	3.0	28.0	35000.0	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1131	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.0	0.1891891891891892	0.1621621621621621	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.0	2.707699326919287	2.745124841783209	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

4.667	4.125	This article was very interesting but also written a little strange.  It was about a wolf who had wondered off from the pack.  The wolf was a protected wolf part of a group being protected by some biological organization.  Had a tracking monitor on him and his life was largely documented.  I guess he wondered from the pack looking to mate.  Well the government, federal government, killed the wolf by a sniper person and its caused a big uproar.  Kind of weird but I guess that is a thing.	surprise	1.0	7.0	1.0	39.0	76000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.429	4.143	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	89	1145	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.77913947345848	2.461468207939069	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000.0$.

This river was a main source of life for everyone and it has been ruined forever. I feel for the guy who said it feels like he lost a family memeber a life lost because its been a source of life for so many for so long. It is very unfair that the clean up is so slow going and that they are taking so long to fix there wrong. I also feel bad for the fish who died because mud was stuc in there gills its such a slow painful death.

6.0	6.0	I empathize with both parties involved in this matter. On one hand, the police and the community are striving to protect the invaluable wildlife and its inhabitants, while on the other hand, the village likely relies on the animal either for nourishment or to generate income due to their profound poverty. I can comprehend the profound desperation one might experience in a developing country, where it could seem as though law enforcement is severing or appropriating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are simply endeavoring to safeguard and uphold what they perceive to be right. They definitely don't deserve to endure such a brutal attack, and it astounds me that they managed to survive such a savage beating. I sincerely hope that more measures are taken to assist both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	137	2240	0.1272727272727272	0.109090909090909	0.0545454545454545	0.1636363636363636	0.0181818181818181	0.2545454545454545	0.1454545454545454	0.0727272727272727	0.0181818181818181	0.0363636363636363	0.0666666666666666	2.899099343860642	2.690580284502506	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The article mainly talked about E-rate, a government program to subsidize the Internet and broadband access. It said that most classrooms are now connected, but the millions of dollars are still being spent. The program seemed to be wasting a lot of money and wasn't showing good results. I agree that just buying computers and being on the Internet doesn't guarantee that kids are receiving a good education.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	21600.0	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	86	1237	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.6295257813501838	2.487605835112237	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600.0$.

3.6666666666666665	2.25	This is a highly disturbing story.  How could this man feel the need to harm his own children?  If we wanted to take his own life, fine, but why the children?  It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story.  But either way, I find it very sad for the kids who lost their lives for no reason.  And what about the rest of the family?  Where was the mother in this story?  How grieved she must be.  The whole thing was very very sad.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	100	1761	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.7226945954945023	2.6575860804544407	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

3.5	3.875	From this article I read 82 percent of ecosystems are being impacted by climate change. Whats interesting about this is the environment and the species in these ecosystems are going through morphological changes. Sometimes we get this idea that climate change will eradicate all life from the Earth but it seems that we will be able to adapt to it to a certain extent. By no means am I say we shouldn't make changes to solve climate change but it is interesting to seem how life is adapting to the changes.	neutral	1.0	6.0	6.0	27.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	2.5	4.571000000000001	3.571	3.571	4.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	91	1086	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.375	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8774915542186603	2.7565353454400663	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

3.833	5.125	So, in India there's a lot of corruption and the Prime Minister made a promise to stop it. He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns.

The precarious state of the ecosystem emphasizes the urgency for swift action on behalf of the defenseless animals who find themselves as helpless victims in this situation.	hope/sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	100	2220	0.2121212121212121	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.1818181818181818	0.2121212121212121	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.0454545454545454	2.7129654110352748	2.7281214035499515	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I find this article deeply concerning. Despite the numerous movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that fewer women are pursuing careers or reaching senior positions because our society often stigmatizes hardworking women who choose not to have children. Moreover, it is evident that we still live in a male-dominated world, with women, on average, earning only half of what men earn, creating little incentive for upward mobility. By placing greater emphasis on girls' education in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to excel in math, science, and technology—an area where many women currently face challenges. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	131	2242	0.0	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.3636363636363636	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.125	2.7156766262428174	2.664707247296594	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	2110	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

They hardly have food or water. They get no interaction so when they do need to round them up, they're mean. That should be illegal. I'm suprised he has not been caught yet. He is very lucky because when he get caught he will regret not taking proper care of them.	anger	2.0	4.0	2.0	34.0	25000.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	6.0	5.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	4.857	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	82	1173	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	2.5861372605734525	2.6408017733658142	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old hispanic or latino female, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.5	4.25	I think in this day and age, there is no reason to be poaching tigers, or any other rare game for that matter. I've discussed this with my friends before, the poachers are generally low status people, trying to feed themselves, and they're selling to the highest bidder they can find. Even if you jail the poachers, more will pop up out of desperation. One day, we'll look back and see all of the greed killing rare animals purposefully, rather than the crappy way we move them out of their territories naturally as humans.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	30.0	50000.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1089	0.16	0.12	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.12	0.24	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.0	2.886237767856457	2.829857670206246	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

They are just selfish people, wanting what they want and unwilling to compromise with each other.  Most actors and actresses are like that.  They are so self-centered.  I can’t stand people like that.  I feel sorry for the poor kid.  Although he will probably grow up to be a self-absorbed, selfish brat, just like his parents.  I swear that I think the less people have, the better off they treat their children and their families.  I have no sympathy for people like these rich snobby people.

5.0	4.5	"These pellet guns almost seem like they were meant to maim individuals, under the guise of a less-lethal round. The fact that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more damage, more permanent damage, seems to back that up. It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity? It's confusing, because I can't think of any reason other than harm someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the case here."	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	48000.0	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	115	1209	0.1627906976744186	0.1395348837209302	0.0	0.0697674418604651	0.0	0.1162790697674418	0.2325581395348837	0.1627906976744186	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0	2.679497452773476	2.698839484602791	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000.0$.

Their time should be spent on non-criminals.  But if they believe the police are the ones who handed them over to a drug cartel, then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	89	1121	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.95893284074278	2.974448426322971	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Just because that one precious person left us we start living with an emotion that our life has come to an end.

As you move forward, life will remove many people from your life just because they aren't required and you can actually reach your destination.

Of course we should be working to protect endangered species, but you won't be successful if you don't care for the humans involved, too. I had no idea elephants were the cause of so much misery.

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too.

3.667	3.875	Before social media, you had to pay to get out information about your business. Now, every person and company is its own media brand - and there are significantly less barriers to reaching people.his has allowed smaller brands to gain a foothold in the market much easier. When we see trends like craft beer, food trucks, and local fashion, that is often the result of harnessing social media platforms to build a following in a cost effective way.  Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street. One or two small businesses isn’t enough to worry a big brand, but millions of them around the country can make a serious dent in their market shar	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	32.0	25000.0	4.0	4.5	5.5	3.5	3.0	4.2860000000000005	3.143	3.143	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	131	1018	0.08	0.0	0.16	0.12	0.0	0.36	0.08	0.04	0.0	0.16	0.032258064516129	3.0540201695908453	2.7588522629823937	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.1666666666666667	3.875	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	1643	0.108695652173913	0.0652173913043478	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.108695652173913	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0344827586206896	2.715918480761497	2.6570584722039	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

6.5	5.5	In this day and age, there should not be such a thing as airline discrimination. The only way someone should be stopped or removed from their flights is if they displayed violent behavior or if they were trying to board with weapons. It is not acceptable at all for someone to be barred from their flight due to the color of their skin or their religious or ethnic background. Those who have been discriminated against for these reasons are suffering undue embarrassment and inconvenience. They should be compensated for this unfair treatment and the airlines should be fined heavily.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	99	1545	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.2692307692307692	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	2.930272373926084	2.893700873208173	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

We look at ourselves and our place in the universe as being important, and as if our time defines the universe the way it's supposed to exist.  Polar bears haven't existed for like 99.9999% of the history of the universe, and now we think it's some travesty that they won't exist in the future.  This is incredibly arrogant and self-centered thinking that I think is silly.  I guess I'd rather have a world with polar bears.

I strongly believe that older individuals should receive proper protection and vigilant monitoring, as situations like these are distressingly common. Many seniors suffer from dementia, leaving them unaware of their surroundings and prone to getting lost easily. It evokes a deep sense of empathy within me, as I contemplate how devastating it would be if this happened to my own parent or grandparent. To imagine them wandering without a coat, feeling cold and frightened, breaks my heart. I am immensely grateful that these officers located her before any harm befell her. I sincerely hope that she can swiftly reunite with her family, and that effective safeguards are implemented to prevent such incidents from occurring again. Perhaps the family is currently overwhelmed, and she might require additional assistance, such as residing in a group home.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	141	2245	0.1428571428571428	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.2040816326530612	0.2040816326530612	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.074074074074074	3.0388711574548584	2.845329717073267	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.0	3.25	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I just can't understand how children and people in general can be pushed to suicide by what they read or are exposed to on the internet. Perhaps it's because I can't imagine harming myself that I don't understand the state that this people must be in. Suicide is such a tough situation and so hard to deal with. It makes me sad to think people target troubled souls and enjoy seeing the harm they do to themselves.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	1730	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.868074302673593	2.763227152971426	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

3.8333333333333335	1.125	I think it's pretty sad that the wolf got killed. I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	102	1755	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0909090909090909	2.7884964743490444	2.6457018966854022	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I feel like the amount of people who drive drunk - generally, but especially on holidays - is honestly alarming. And they're always so casual about it, like it's not a big deal and they aren't taking the lives of anyone they get remotely near while behind the wheel into their hands.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	4.143	3.286	4.429	3.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	69	1598	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0833333333333333	2.668192208810561	2.5650301518805527	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 21000.0$.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

4.167	4.5	I think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma.  Some people die with less pain, and we tend to call them lucky.  I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	120	1339	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.

5.0	5.0	This article truly grounds us and reminds us of the complexity of the world we inhabit. It underscores the fallibility of scientific knowledge and the vast expanse of yet-to-be-discovered information. The realization that these animals, previously free from the disease, have now become carriers, raises concerns about genetic mutations and the potential for widespread transmission. The profound sadness lies in the suffering endured by these innocent creatures, with no relief in sight. My fervent hope is that extensive research will be conducted to halt the disease's spread before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I express gratitude towards the conservationist who raised awareness and encouraged others to share their concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	113	2231	0.0789473684210526	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.2631578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0357142857142857	2.9639081444271405	2.78119214424294	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I would easily take a pie in the face if afterwards I was a rich white man who still had supporters behind me.	neutral	2.0	6.0	3.0	28.0	35000.0	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	95	1132	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.131578947368421	0.0769230769230769	2.6691350716502904	2.534174358443118	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

3.6666666666666665	1.75	It's sad that people anywhere are still threatened because of their beliefs. I don't understand why any religion is so set against other that they want to hurt, kill and threaten them. How does someone else's belief harm your own? I guess I just don't get why people get so fanatic about religion and ignore parts of the teachings about tolerance, peace and understanding. It seems wrong that people use religion as an excuse for violence.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	76	1765	0.1612903225806451	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.2903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.032258064516129	0.0555555555555555	2.715718343667114	2.7363010531004552	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I empathize deeply with the victims and their families. They were simply carrying out their duties when this unfortunate explosion, resulting from negligence, tragically claimed their lives. It is disheartening that despite being aware of the hazardous and insecure working conditions, no action has been taken to shut down these facilities. While I appreciate the closure of approximately 1,000 establishments, I believe more needs to be accomplished. It is crucial to establish a governing body and implement regulations similar to OSHA in the US, ensuring the protection of workers and the implementation of all necessary precautions to safeguard human life. Currently, families are left bereft of their beloved sons, fathers, and sources of income, when a simple closure could have prevented this loss. I fervently hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	133	2206	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0408163265306122	0.2244897959183673	0.1836734693877551	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1020408163265306	0.0357142857142857	3.0012886178493576	2.916732470700339	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

On the other hand, why wait twenty years to bring up an incident that happened that was that disturbing?  I think some women are making allegations and accusations just to get attention or for political motivations.  Who knows why.  People do crazy things for crazy reasons.  I'm just really skeptical of a lot of these things I hear and I think the #metoo movement has gotten way out of hand.

It should not take such a horrible event to occur for people to recognize that there is a problem with the building and the way technicians are doing inspections.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	47000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	98	1408	0.2	0.125	0.075	0.025	0.025	0.1	0.25	0.15	0.025	0.025	0.0	2.68284293666439	2.766621894850316	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 47000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	143	1590	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0416666666666666	2.940207057128023	2.766534416358188	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

It was actually really heartening to read this, because I want to start a family in the next few years and I was practically twitching with anxiety. I tend to get bitten by a ton of mosquitoes every summer no matter what I do while my husband doesn't get bit at all. And what about global climate change pushing things like this further north?

6.0	6.0	This is just crazy that people are still dying today when there is medicine that can easily save there lives. There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.	anger/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	144	2170	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0652173913043478	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.04	2.803115171970997	2.8067926541500885	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Someone gets pissy because they have no money and decide to hurt someone else that has nothing to do with it.

The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.

6.0	1.625	It is very alarming to my spirit that humans who were once adopted by American citizens would be scrutinized for no reason of their own doing.  There is so many things wrong with the American system of adopting children from other countries.  If we are going to adopt children from other countries as Americans, they should be granted their citizenship immediately upon being adopted. Before another adoption takes place that involves American parents, and innocent children from another country, there needs to be new rules, regulations, and laws mandated for the protection of these children and families of what can be deemed as a sloppy American adoption system.  Let's fix it right away.	anger	2.0	7.0	3.0	50.0	80000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	2.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	113	1522	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.1875	0.0625	0.3125	0.25	0.0	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	2.916676908783881	2.8751049347149267	medium	medium	An essay written by a 50.0 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?

They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

It's like its 1800's again in the U.S. and the rich are using the Southern Strategy to stop likely democrats from voting, using the divide and conquer strategy of trying to turn the people against each other instead of who they should be against. rich republicans.  This is fascism, naziism, and we are going to lose our democracy if people don't wake up and get in the streets and demand these people be stopped.  It's literally a coup of our government.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	58.0	20000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	3.143	3.429	4.143	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	94	1011	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.952903420573453	2.901802447512368	medium	medium	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

It's really an inspiring thing for them to do to go in and save these animals even in the midst of an ongoing conflict where they could have come to harm, as well as the animals. Also important is the situation in Gaza, and other conflict zones, makes it rather difficult to maintain a humanely run zoo, and have veterinarians on hand in case the animals become ill.	joy	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	86	1182	0.2307692307692307	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.0	3.1719106981473564	2.967885050559608	medium	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

No one really wants to address the reasons that drive people to terrorism, so I guess we will just continue to let the media sensationalize death and complain about it the next day.	neutral	2.0	6.0	6.0	37.0	50000.0	5.5	7.0	4.5	6.0	7.0	3.143	2.143	2.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	62	976	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.726893586569862	2.849756856293088	low	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

There are also some bad christians out there and we dont base our whole view on things based on the fact that they were christian.

1.833	5.625	Since Trump became president it has been clear that people who are racist, misogynist, and sexist people have been hiding, probably because society overall expresses these things as a bad thing. But since they see a leader that is like them, it gives them fuel to be bad people in public and even are proud of it. I just hate Trump and everything about him as well as his supporters.	anger	2.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	40000.0	4.0	4.0	1.0	6.0	2.5	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	3.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	70	1389	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	2.8798014014936717	2.8469840010681	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, went to college, with an income of 40000.0$.

In one brief moment the world goes from visible to invisible in an instant.  It's got to be nearly traumatic (although she seems to be remaining upbeat).  But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened.  Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings.  I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted.  If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected.  If she wasn't part of the unrest, then she should have fled the area.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	145	1920	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.1578947368421052	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.04	2.61566603327308	2.5278560164688244	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I think it is disgusting men in such high power positions use it to just attack women like this. They think they can just get away with it and there actions have no consequences. So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me. Noone should deal with this alone and it should never be swept under the wrong or at blame of the women.	anger/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	133	2174	0.1363636363636363	0.1818181818181818	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0625	2.9775914216299	2.9347188116624228	low	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I was just more alarmed i would say.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	80000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.857	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	64	1418	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.620122454816176	2.5070536727607755	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 80000.0$.

4.0	3.0	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.	neutral/sadness	2.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	100000.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	133	2147	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.674559314803139	2.6434111615432863	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

4.167	2.5	As frustrating as it might be for the overflow of goldfish thriving in wildlife, I am very curious to see a four-pound goldfish. Could you imagine? The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

4.333	5.0	Just when you think you have heard enough crazy Donald Trump stories this one takes the cake. I just read about a mother from Fresno Texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock school election for Donald Trump she also videotaped it. Well, of course, the video went viral. The Fort Bend County Texas sheriff's department went to check out the situation and the child seemed to be in good health. The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke. I hope the child is not permanently scarred from this incident.	neutral	2.0	2.0	1.0	60.0	74000.0	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	123	1295	0.0222222222222222	0.0222222222222222	0.1777777777777777	0.1555555555555555	0.0666666666666666	0.1777777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0	0.1777777777777777	0.0833333333333333	2.6428405006901152	2.67549175192833	low	low	An essay written by a 60.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000.0$.

2.833	3.625	The article is very well-written and relatively thoughtful.  I also find it heartwarming and touching at times.  However, it's also overflowing with this self-centered ignorance that our internet culture has engendered over the last decade. We are specks, even on this planet, even in our own cities.  It's an enormous world--unfathomably large.  To think that it is not irrational to be afraid of terrorism is stupid.  Statistically speaking--i.e. RATIONALLY speaking--it is absurd to be afraid of terrorism.  And yet intelligent people are.  They see the world too much through their phones, through the images (images, not tangible things) depicted on it.  The world that exists in our phones does not exist in reality.  They are two distinct things.  People are stupid.	joy	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	121	1571	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.3461538461538461	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.349244202322921	2.3799756084089427	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.  Hopefully the truth is discovered and people can be content with the tragic event.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	118	1771	0.125	0.075	0.025	0.125	0.075	0.125	0.225	0.125	0.05	0.05	0.0526315789473684	2.5693970936654065	2.436672076148976	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It is so sad that people need to keep children home just to line up to get food. They also cant afford to send them lunch and the government isnt stepping in to help which would be a good investment as they are the future of there society.Someone needs to step in send aid as teachers can only do so much they need to demand others to help out.

1.167	6.375	I just read this article about how Canada actually had school where they would force indigenous people of their land to go.  They tried to erase their history , and their language.  I always thought canada was such a peaceful country.  These people were even experimented on, and the school was still in operation up until 1996!, That is astonishing.  I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.  This just shows you that people are pretty much the same, and pretty much were savages, until recently.  Even now though, we still have a long way to go, until we reach a place where everyones culture and differences are celebrated, and not shamed, and destroyed	surprise	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	20000.0	3.5	6.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	4.143	3.857	3.714	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	127	1004	0.15	0.05	0.175	0.15	0.025	0.175	0.125	0.05	0.0	0.1	0.1111111111111111	2.963426320150118	2.7386574140700515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 20000.0$.

1.167	1.25	It's weird how I don't really feel sorry for these people. Timeshares just seem like a terrible idea and I've always associated it with conspicuous consumption. Really...just rent a hotel room when you can go. Buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a problem waiting to happen. But I can't stand how grimy the companies are and how they jerk people around. It just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people's pockets. And the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they don't want to play fair.	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	31.0	67000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	107	943	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.0	2.544203069942621	2.5323531852857726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000.0$.

3.167	5.875	The thought of such conditions in the slaughtering of chickens is very disturbing. I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	47000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	76	1410	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.883259260990456	2.922690528251083	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 47000.0$.

6.0	1.0	Leonard Cohen just died. Knew little about him but now see Ill have to look into his songs and writing. He was the epitome of the starving writer, it seems. His popularity continued to grow as he aged, and he was able to reap some rewards, but it didn't really catch up with his needs until recent years. He was a Buddhist monk, too. Had no idea. He clearly raised the bar in song writing.	joy	2.0	7.0	1.0	62.0	5500.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	75	926	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.4545454545454545	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.6111603007234945	2.39574459478588	medium	low	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 5500.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article deeply troubled me on various levels. Imagining myself in the shoes of the girl described is inconceivable because I could never fathom my own parents inflicting such pain upon me. The fact that her parents are now out of jail is incredibly disturbing, as their actions present a significant danger to society, particularly considering they perpetrated these acts against their own child. I fervently hope that these individuals never encounter another vulnerable child. As parents, our foremost responsibility is to protect our children, and this girl can never reclaim the innocence of her childhood. It is unimaginable how one could trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such horrific experiences. Her mental well-being must be profoundly impacted, and I earnestly wish for her to receive the necessary support and guidance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	134	2256	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.1162790697674418	0.0697674418604651	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.1162790697674418	0.0454545454545454	2.9823536598803804	3.008944842818962	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Your family isn't being rent in twain, your wife isn't being raped and your children aren't being sold into slavery. I know they have the purest intentions, but this just seems silly to me.

1.5	1.5	All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.

1.833	5.75	Take a look at this. It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down. It may be our best shot.

6.0	2.125	I recently came across a truly intriguing yet profoundly disheartening article. It revolved around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What amazed me was that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It's remarkable to imagine running an entire magazine at such a tender age. However, her life was marked by a long-standing battle with depression, which she chronicled in a book. Struggling with her mental health, she was admitted to a mental hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, despite being cleared by the hospital, she tragically walked into the ocean and met her untimely demise. The fact that she didn't receive the necessary assistance is undeniably heartbreaking. It is my sincere hope that all our friends are aware of our unwavering support, knowing that we stand by them through all their struggles.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	149	2233	0.0909090909090909	0.0227272727272727	0.0681818181818181	0.1818181818181818	0.0681818181818181	0.2272727272727272	0.1136363636363636	0.1136363636363636	0.0	0.1136363636363636	0.0357142857142857	2.935014822506919	2.822885791321533	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

I find the article describing it to be absurd, however.  Describing a Wildlife Services program in the way it did was over-the-top.  Besides, I always find these perspectives backwards: people who are seemingly more concerned about the welfare of animals than people.

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect.

5.0	3.125	This article presents a viewpoint I strongly agree with. The idea of how places such as zzos and theme parks are filled with impressionable young minds who should not be exposed to smoking had never crossed my mind. I believe that cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is prohibited. When children witness others smoking, they perceive it as normal and acceptable. By shielding this generation from such influences, we can promote healthier choices and a brighter future. Implementing a ban like this holds the potential to significantly reduce the number of new smokers and eradicate the societal appeal of smoking for future generations. I fully support this suggested prohibition and foresee no negative consequences in enforcing it.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	121	2266	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.2580645161290322	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.459469704803454	2.499544825667995	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.

It is unclear if it was really sanctioned by their government, but Pakistan shelled across the border and killed 13 Indian civilians.

India claims they were destroying a terrorist encampment on the Pakistan side of the border, and Pakistan claims they bombed one of their military bases.

6.0	1.5	The medical profession is clueless according to three articles I just read. They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

The move was a welcome development and everything should be done to make sure things like this does not happen.	neutral	2.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	100000.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	80	1884	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.702570750711038	2.9812675905528843	low	medium	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000.0$.

They were merely fulfilling their job responsibilities when this unfortunate explosion, caused by sheer carelessness, resulted in the loss of their lives. It is truly tragic that the awareness of the life-threatening and unsafe working conditions did not prompt immediate closure. Although I am glad that around 1,000 establishments are scheduled for closure, I strongly believe that more comprehensive measures are required. The formation of a council and the implementation of regulations, similar to the US's OSHA, should be prioritized to safeguard workers and ensure the strict adherence to safety measures for the preservation of human life. As a consequence of the failure to act promptly, families are now left without their sons, fathers, and a source of income that could have been easily avoided. I earnestly hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	145	2207	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.125	0.0357142857142857	0.0892857142857142	0.054054054054054	2.9157967974667645	2.795032757138069	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.0	3.875	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.

1.8333333333333333	1.0	I find it sad that elephants are still being poached and killed just for their tusks.  Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made.  I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?  I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.  	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	101	1795	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.2727272727272727	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.575663440164933	2.451092105291401	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

6.5	1.0	I just read an article about veterans and PTSD. It was really sad to learn about how many people suffer from PTSD. The article talked about how many veterans are affraid to seek help. It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it. I can only begin to imagine what our veterans are going thrugh.

6.0	4.625	"What a mess immigration across the globe has become. It is such a delicate subject. Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return.

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.  Just stupidness all around.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	126	2111	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.04	2.5847688753460147	2.4827858651419983	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It happened right here in Volusia county, I'm surprised I do not remember seeing it on the news before now. They said that 3 people was injured during the attack. I can't imagine a squirrel being able to cause much damage, maybe a scratch or two. I wonder what happened to cause the squirrel to freak out like that. The squirrel probably had some babies in the area that was being threatened by the people.	surprise	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	6.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	1485	0.16	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.08	0.04	0.2	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.0	2.6941337961127374	2.546129036575677	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

3.0	5.25	I have not heard of this story, but wanted to see if you knew anything about it. I know we were talking the other day about being worried about getting stuck in a situation like this because of all the recent shootings. I think this story was a real eye opener for me, because it shows just how easy something like this happening would be. I feel that what you said about mental health and paying more attention to the youth is really another central point to this story. This story made me think even more about owning a gun and having a open carry permit to keep safe and be able to protect my loved ones and family.	fear	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	119	828	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.948809108057129	2.7812604972856665	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

2.0	6.125	Ugh, I just read an article about our disgusting president and the way women are reacting to these rumors, allegations and truths made about this man and his inexcusable treatment of women in the past. And, that's just it, who is stupid enough to think his behavior is only in the past and is not still occurring today behind closed doors!? I am sure it is only a matter of time before that also comes out. The more and more I read about him, the more and more disturbed I am to have him as a president and wish I did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots.

It sheds light on the fallibility of scientific understanding and the vast realm of knowledge that remains beyond our grasp. The discovery that these animals, previously unaffected by the disease, now carry it raises alarming questions about potential genetic mutations and the subsequent spread of the ailment. The sorrowful reality is that these small creatures endure immense pain without any means of alleviating it. I earnestly hope that extensive research will be conducted to find ways to curtail the disease's transmission before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I am grateful to the conservationist who noticed and drew attention to this issue, prompting others to express similar concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	124	2232	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.2926829268292683	0.1707317073170731	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.024390243902439	0.025	2.7926370116267147	2.703932382352076	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I hate we are not changing and helping the environment. 	disgust	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	63	2104	0.08	0.16	0.0	0.04	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.12	0.16	0.04	0.0	2.9876990652136333	2.895573140780029	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

5.0	6.0	This is the kind of stuff that happens all over and is always underreported because the perpetrators of such sexual harassment and assaults are protected by their power in society and other powerful people. It was long just an unspoken or open secret that everyone basically knew, but it's good that it's finally coming to light with people willing to speak up, especially the victims. If they didn't speak up, people would go on thinking that this kind of stuff only happens in TV and movies. Art imitates life, and vice versa.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	3500.0	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	92	1183	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.1724137931034483	0.2413793103448276	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.1666666666666666	2.687378509538006	2.511262255975848	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500.0$.

This town needs some better traffic laws and maybe drivers licensure tests. It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt. I hope everyone gets therapy to talk about how much this probably effected them.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	116	1759	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	2.797317639871644	2.614911826513728	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The article was very vague, but the woman describing the situation spoke of the rhino like a member of her family. The whole thing was very touching.

I understand fearing death and economy troubles but if everyone just left those countries the ones they flee to will just have similar problems.
