Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	8.51063829787234	3.546099290780142	12.056737588652483	8.51063829787234	4.25531914893617	4.964539007092199	0	3.236149306539707	2.898489376146181

On the bright side, with advancing computer and health sciences, the future does have some light at the end of the tunnel. I think it's probably helpful to try to focus a bit on the positive.  My political views are different from most.  I find myself disagreeing with many Republican and Democrat stances.  I'm in favor of universal healthcare, basic income, and access to assisted suicide (rational suicide, access to drugs like Nembutal for anyone who thinks they might want to make the rational decision not to live, and instead die in a humane way).	sadness	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	8.695652173913045	6.086956521739131	8.695652173913045	9.56521739130435	13.913043478260871	2.608695652173913	0	3.9518309460402703	3.6649458746422274

I feel bad that she went through that.	sadness	2	4	1	23	55000	4.0	5.5	1.0	5.0	3.5	3.143	3.143	4.857	3.857	16.666666666666668	8.974358974358974	10.256410256410255	14.102564102564102	6.41025641025641	8.974358974358974	0	5.4726200311599715	5.061364369930454

I think that the Greenhouse Effect is highly over-rated. I find that the forces that oppose and are against it, has a strong point. As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase. Those in opposition, who feel that it's just an umbrella word to funnel monies in areas that are not needed. That believe Mother Nature and the natural state of how our Earth and it's environment works, are also somewhat correct. I wish each would meet halfway.	sadness	2	4	1	33	60000	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	6.081081081081082	4.054054054054054	4.72972972972973	2.027027027027027	5.405405405405405	2.027027027027027	0	2.9829245658888013	2.781311374626922

It sounds as if his son could have been more disturbed than originally thought at the other arrest.  I would be devastated if I felt so threatened by my own child that I had to resort to violence.  I mean, how terrible it must be!

It gives us the opportunity to learn and see them up close but at the same time its hard to handle the fact that these animals might be feeling pain.

He is been owned by a guy and held in chains. He used Nosey to perform for public entertainment in circuses and forced for most of her life to give rides to adults and children  across the United States. Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being. The owner has been cited numerous times but in the same time his license was still approved for renewal each year. There should be awareness for this abuse to stop.	sadness	1	6	1	41	37500	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.4290000000000003	3.857	4.143	4.0	1.6	5.6	7.2	6.4	4.0	0	3.6059722160255956	3.4054403908075708

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country.

Sad to see that our world is slowly spiraling into this chaos that just continues to grow.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	8.571428571428571	2.857142857142857	10.476190476190476	9.523809523809524	11.428571428571429	3.8095238095238093	0	3.993698583209	3.8204943827697173

I know you voted for him and I know that you are not racist, but can you see how much this has torn the country apart?

When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.  Nothing different is happening in the Middle East.  We always hear that might makes right but that's not truly the case.  Might makes blight and generations suffer till most of it is forgotten.

Initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and attention this situation is creating. I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	6.481481481481481	2.7777777777777777	5.555555555555555	7.4074074074074066	7.4074074074074066	1.8518518518518516	0	4.029375532577607	3.847362111812271

Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me. It worries me that the child will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for fear of upsetting their parent.	disgust	2	6	3	28	35000	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	10.619469026548673	5.3097345132743365	9.734513274336283	10.619469026548673	11.504424778761063	5.3097345132743365	0	3.7213738638901015	3.7005135186640956

It seems very few people are trying to stop it and it is maddening. We need to take more control over the things that are being put into the air that could be causing such an atrocious thing. We need to start reusing things and switching to organically grown things, if possible. The oceans and lakes are suffering and eventually, we will, too.	disgust	2	2	1	29	45000	5.5	5.0	4.0	6.5	3.5	3.429	5.0	2.571	4.428999999999999	7.894736842105263	9.210526315789474	10.526315789473685	1.3157894736842106	7.894736842105263	1.3157894736842106	0	5.73861775961483	5.646239267809002

It doesn't affect my fellings at all. It is clearly and issue but they'll make a vaccine for those who don't become immune by way of their own system, then the virus will become resistant to the vaccinations and it will be a never ending up and down cycle that we see all the time.

However, it is clear that there were so many problems with the company, including the CEO, that the company has been doomed for a while. It's a shame the company was so poorly mismanaged. Maybe if they had a different CEO, they would have been able to survive.	fear	1	6	1	38	50000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	4.838709677419355	8.064516129032258	14.516129032258064	3.2258064516129035	12.903225806451614	3.2258064516129035	0	7.128426779915642	6.481505344326212

Could you imagine? The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

My guess is that standard operating procedure does not include crawling inside the machine to unclog it. I understand that it is a tragedy, but geez, at some point people have to be held accountable for their own actions. I'm sure there will be a lawsuit, probably a hefty one, but I hope they lose.

And the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they don't want to play fair.	anger	2	7	1	31	67000	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	6.5420560747663545	6.5420560747663545	5.607476635514018	4.672897196261682	6.5420560747663545	3.7383177570093458	0	3.937561700475397	3.900648676419772

I'm sure they have some many tiny provisions in their contracts that make them really difficult to get out of successfully.	anger	1	6	1	25	50000	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	1.1111111111111112	0.0	2.2222222222222223	5.555555555555555	1.1111111111111112	0.0	0	4.882457683947517	4.636227952136679

There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.	anger	2	4	1	34	90000	7.0	3.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.0	2.571	4.2860000000000005	12.857142857142858	7.142857142857143	12.142857142857144	3.5714285714285716	7.142857142857143	4.285714285714286	0	3.168456669862644	3.1341139399336844

Gay rights protesters were rounded up by police and taken away from the resort where they were protesting and of those that attempted to resume protesting at another spot, police escorted them away.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	11.206896551724139	1.7241379310344829	6.8965517241379315	12.931034482758621	12.931034482758621	6.03448275862069	0	4.034050099664196	3.5188330406733437

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2	4	1	33	60000	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	2.8985507246376816	1.4492753623188408	3.6231884057971016	3.6231884057971016	4.347826086956522	1.4492753623188408	0	3.279852732098635	2.9116088457491416

I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment.

It is about how Iraqis found evidence of torture by Islanic State in mass graves near the city Mosul.  Can you believe that, they literally just killed and dumped bodies there.  From what the articles says in just one hours time they found 20 to 25 bodies.  Some where hard to even tell if it were human or not.  They still can't figure out how they died but they will soon enough.  Though from the state of decomposition it has only been a few weeks that they have been there. All I can say is that were tortured point blank.	surprise	2	2	1	32	50000	7.0	6.5	1.0	7.0	4.5	4.428999999999999	4.143	4.428999999999999	5.0	6.140350877192983	7.017543859649123	7.017543859649123	6.140350877192983	10.526315789473685	0.0	0	3.8336520234721645	3.755318751964161

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1	3	1	33	58000	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	7.638888888888889	0.0	3.4722222222222223	9.722222222222223	4.166666666666667	6.944444444444445	0	2.9742019966446396	2.9187562870148835

While the reef is mostly destroyed, it has sections that are coming back to life, and it can be stimulated back to recovery despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death stroke. Did you know it can be seen from outer space? How magnificent! We should do what we can to preserve it, even if it is a losing cause because it is a true wonder of nature.

I was just reading an article about it, never thought things could have been so bad, they are even worse than what I imagine worst than what we talked about. I find it funny how we are so enclosed in our small little world, while in Chicago we are celebrating about CUBS victory in over 100 years, in Haiti, they are suffering for water and food.	surprise	1	2	2	27	39000	5.0	5.5	2.5	3.5	1.0	3.429	3.429	3.0	3.571	3.658536585365854	6.097560975609756	7.317073170731708	7.317073170731708	7.317073170731708	1.2195121951219512	0	5.740777345587575	5.295629263032004
