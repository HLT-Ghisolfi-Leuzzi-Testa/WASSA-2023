Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true.

Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	83	74	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	This is so sad.

He, along with his wife, surrendered themselves to provincial police in August to clear their names and deny involvement.

1.0	1.625	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation. It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	281	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation.

Perhaps they shouldn't have gone so far down because there was a sign saying not to, but still, it was very sad that they died. They were experienced and should have survived, but they didn't. I really feel sorry for their friends and family. They will be dearly missed. Please pray for them and their families.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	60000.0	6.0	4.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	4.143	4.857	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	87	295	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	I found this article that was really sad about these divers that they found dead in a Florida cave system.

They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals.

6.0	6.625	I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway. I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	154	456	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is.

The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely.

Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.'An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

He gets torn down before he has a chance to do anything. I'm just so mad at the whole election system and the way things are done.

It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	151	543	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear.

1.0	1.0	It doesn't matter what country you live in. The powerful will always stomp on the weak. Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	136	544	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	It doesn't matter what country you live in.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	134	610	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.

2.5	5.875	I just read this crazy article about Wells Fargo that I thought I would share with you. It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

Seriously, where is a CEO going to travel to enjoy his millions and stay at luxury resort villas when the environment is completely fucked? The luxury resort will be gone!!

The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	113	647	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	The dwindling wilderness is due, in part to humanity’s activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and of course, oil and gas exploration.

Cancer really does humble the soul into new places that one never thought possible to emerge stronger from feeling. It sounds like she faced it with a mask of strength at first.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high.

7.0	4.875	I just read an article discussing the impact global warming is having on polar bears. It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go. Anyways, you should really read this article. I told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed, so go read it.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	40000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	143	733	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	I just read an article discussing the impact global warming is having on polar bears.

For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly. I feel bad for the family of the victim and I hope they see justice done.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	44.0	49000.0	5.5	5.5	1.0	4.5	2.5	4.143	3.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	147	806	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	It sounds like she wasn't cut out to be a cop.

By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.'An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas.

I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

7.0	1.5	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents. I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	140	938	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents.

Just because that one precious person left us we start living with an emotion that our life has come to an end.

3.833	5.875	I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face.

I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct.

4.167	5.0	There's something terrifying about being attacked by animals. It's even more horrifying to find out the animals that are attacking you are the ones you think are so cute and adorable. I just read an article about squirrels attacking a retirement home and injuring three elderly. It must have been so terrifying for them to encounter this event. Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases. I feel troubled thinking about this because these elderly can't really react quick enough in these situations.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	135	1024	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	There's something terrifying about being attacked by animals.

5.5	5.125	"More toddlers and preschoolers are overdosing on opioids — In recent years, rates of toddlers and preschoolers hospitalized for opioid overdoses more than doubled, according to a new study. In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed.

5.0	2.25	Reading this article makes me upset. I hate what we do to native people. It seems as a society we seem to ignore their feelings and traditions just to move ourselves forward. We forget that we intruded onto their land to make ourselves homes that we enjoy yet we can't offer them the same good feeling. To even think that the option of having dangerous amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me.	anger	2.0	6.0	5.0	33.0	51000.0	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	75	1081	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0.2	0.125	0.1	0.075	0.0	2.8688979199603573	2.9872844590180896	Reading this article makes me upset.

There was a horrible accident on a family type Water Ride in Gold Coast Austrailia.  4 People were killed..2 women ages 42 and 32 I think, also two men, 38, and 35,.

I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too.

I found this article very intriguing, there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to protect this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more resistant to various dangerous fungal strains.Apparently this presents a great challenge for the scientists but they are hoping to cultivate more banana plant varieties that will be more resistant to various illness.'An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million.

My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic.

It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.

I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.  I really think this is unfair to me.'An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 32000.0$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things.

I kind of wish he hadn't run again; I'm glad he's not trying again this time. After reading this story, it's hard to feel sympathetic, even in retrospect. But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

1.833	1.0	I pretty much hate all wildlife including squirrels. They should  just go blast the little varmint. After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

3.0	4.5	You know one thing late Thursday that the Islamic State used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq.

I have had situations in my life that I wish I had someone to turn to and I did not. That is the person I try to be for my friends.

When others are suffering I like to be able to help them get over it. I like to be known as a good friend to others who are in need. I have had situations in my life that I wish I had someone to turn to and I did not. That is the person I try to be for my friends.

1.0	6.625	I just read an article about a school volunteer being indicted on child porn charges. I cannot understand what makes these monsters tick. It seems as if every day I am reading about a case of child sex abuse. I think these people should be killed on site. That would change their minds before commiting sex acts on a child. It just keeps getting worse and worse, more and more common. They will be spared in court. They will more than likely get probation and released right back into the community they victimized. It really makes me sick.

I read an article today about the treatment of some inmates. The worst case scenarios that are made to think that our prison system is broken but is that really the case? I mean we know the justice system is broken and there are criminals walking around on the street so why would anyone think that our prison system isn't just as messed up as our justice system? Don't get me wrong, it's maddening.'An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.

Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

My grandparents definitely.  anyway, hopefully, they can get better services to help people like this and avoid situations like the one in the article.

It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces.

Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""

I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""  But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.  Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible.  I imagine the guy breaking the flamingos long neck.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there.

Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there.

6.5	4.625	I just read an article about a boy falling out of an apartment window and dying. That is so sad he was only 2 years old. The little boy pushed open the screen in his bedroom and fell out of the window to his death. We should all make sure our windows are secure and our kids cannot open them .Omg that poor boy was proably hurting so bad before he died. I cannot imagine what the parents are going through after losing a child in such a manner.

3.6666666666666665	1.75	It's sad that people anywhere are still threatened because of their beliefs. I don't understand why any religion is so set against other that they want to hurt, kill and threaten them. How does someone else's belief harm your own? I guess I just don't get why people get so fanatic about religion and ignore parts of the teachings about tolerance, peace and understanding. It seems wrong that people use religion as an excuse for violence.

Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made.  I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?  I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.

6.0	6.0	This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

1.5	1.0	I found it a little hard to relate to this situation.  It seems so far away and I can't really connect with any of the people involved.  I'm really sad for these families and their children.  It seems like they are in a difficult position without much option or anything they can do about it.  I hope they are able to find some resolution or some solution, but it doesn't seem like much is going to change there anytime soon.  I don't think this is the problem of the United States and we should remain uninvolved.

The mother lost a husband and son and any other family members like children would have lost a brother and their dad.  The whole thing is just terrible really.

This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.

Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.

It seems like it was a tough call because we are there allies and the us soldiers should have followed protocol by stopping.If it was a miscommunication I hope they take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again as fighting and killing eachother is a waste that needs to be for the bad guys. I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier.

The truth is that hate crimes have been ongoing for many decades, an d it has nothing to do with the man in office.  There were multiple hate crimes while Obama was in office and really every other president before him.  People, especially the media, love to scapegoat Trump.

I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.

5.333333333333333	5.875	I feel really bad for the rangers, who were just doing their job and were treated unmercifully by the villagers.  And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.

The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

1.0	2.625	I don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.

They deserve life in jail the fact that they are out is just absurd. If they could do this to there own child i think they are to be considered at risk to other children and the community.

7.0	2.5	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day.

2.5	1.25	Overall, this is a really sad incident.  The poor dog was just helplessly left in the car to suffer, and there's no way it could have let itself out or saved itself.  IT's really sad to me when people are this negligent about pets and other people.  Especially vulnerable populations.  Honestly I think whatever punishment she gets, such as an animal cruelty charge, is definitely deserved and she will just have to take that as it comes.  She should have been more careful with the animal, end of story.

4.166666666666667	5.125	I hate hearing about American troop deaths.  I feel sad for the Captain and First Sergeant who died.  Those are experienced and high-ranking people.  I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death.

2.0	3.125	This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.

They were simply performing their job duties when this reckless explosion, which could have been prevented, tragically snatched away their lives. It is disheartening to know that despite being aware of the lethal and unsafe working conditions, the authorities have yet to take the necessary steps to shut down such operations. While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life.

It is unfathomable to think that people would forsake their parents and elderly family members during times of war.

It featured a woman who lived in the UK and held the remarkable position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What struck me was the astonishing fact that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It is truly remarkable to envision running an entire magazine at such an early stage in life. However, her existence was plagued by a lifelong struggle with depression, which she openly addressed in a book. Battling her mental health issues, she sought help and was admitted to a mental hospital. Tragically, despite being cleared by the hospital, she chose to walk into the ocean and met a heartbreaking fate. The lack of adequate assistance she received is truly saddening.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I find this article deeply concerning. Despite the numerous movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that fewer women are pursuing careers or reaching senior positions because our society often stigmatizes hardworking women who choose not to have children. Moreover, it is evident that we still live in a male-dominated world, with women, on average, earning only half of what men earn, creating little incentive for upward mobility. By placing greater emphasis on girls' education in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to excel in math, science, and technology—an area where many women currently face challenges.

Despite the progress made through various movements, awareness efforts, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading the way in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that the decreasing number of women in the workforce or in senior positions is a result of the societal pressure on women who work hard but choose not to have children. Additionally, the persisting gender pay gap, with women earning an average of 50 percent less than men, creates little motivation to strive for higher positions.

Despite the multitude of movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women in America, it is disheartening that we have not yet achieved the top spot in all aspects of gender equality.

1.0	3.875	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.

All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?  Screw that.

I think we need to do something about the plastic issue, maybe starting by cutting down on all the plastic we use.'An essay written by a 38 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

3.1666666666666665	4.5	I do feel for the people in the country, especially the starving kids, who presumably don't understand what's going on except for the fact that they're hungry.  But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?

It really makes me grateful to live in this beautiful nation where we live, America, and to have the freedoms that we have.

The US was supporting these airstrikes which is sort of sad.  I find the whole situation over there so senseless.  IT's like they are all just killing each other nonstop for no valid reason.

1.0	2.25	I found this story quite distressing.  It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers.  But I guess they support poaching in that area?  Perhaps it is important to their economy?  Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.  Really, what is wrong with people?
