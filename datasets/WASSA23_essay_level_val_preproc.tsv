Supplies being looted by crowds is understandable because they are hungry and people need food and water to survive.

She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	23	Hope/Sadness

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations. Lina was left in that car for 38 hours. Can you believe this? This deeply disturbs me. How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours? Just unbelievable. The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand. I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals. It's infuriating.

283	202	This is a highly disturbing story. How could this man feel the need to harm his own children? If we wanted to take his own life, fine, but why the children? It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story. But either way, I find it very sad for the kids who lost their lives for no reason. And what about the rest of the family? Where was the mother in this story? How grieved she must be. The whole thing was very very sad.	3.6666666666666665	2.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	782	Sadness
288	71	I found this story quite distressing. It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers. But I guess they support poaching in that area? Perhaps it is important to their economy? Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society. This is an example of that and it is very distressing. Really, what is wrong with people?	1.0	2.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	787	Disgust/Surprise
318	39	I think it's pretty sad that the wolf got killed. I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	3.8333333333333335	1.125	13	2	6	1	25	60000	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	2	train	817	Sadness

He is now being deported back to South Korea and is currently detained in an immigration detention center while customs enforcement and immigration can make the necessary arrangements. Despite having lived in the united states for the vast majority of his life, thirty seven years of his total fourty one years, he is now being deported. Adam stated that he had ended up on the radar of federal immigration officials after applying for a green card in 2012.	6.0	2.0	43	2	6	1	33	110000	7.0	4.5	1.5	7.0	7.0	4.286	1.286	3.857	4.0	2	train	823	Neutral

It mentioned several times that multiple people were brutally raped and even murdered, sometimes by government officials, and this is really distressing and sad. That is obviously something that should never happen to anyone, so it makes me sad to hear that these people suffered like that. I think clearly something needs to be done over there but I'm not sure what.	1.3333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	840	Sadness

I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	849	Neutral

I'm not sure that there is an obvious solution except maybe better sanitation for some of these people. But I guess some of that is cultural and not much can be done to fix it. Educating the people about it does not seem to have helped much, nor does vaccinating them.

353	116	Hey A: Did you read the article on cholera in third world countries? I'll focus on the Haiti piece of the article. Haiti had an overwhelming number of folks that had cholera. Vaccines were offered to the government because there was little they could do for those folks other than IVs. The government refused to take help from the World Health Organization. The corruption that goes on that country never ceases to amaze me. I got extremely frustrated reading what could have been done but nothing was done. So many people died that should not have.	7.0	5.5	8	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	2	train	852	Anger/Neutral

Why do people kill others I will never understand. Also for the families that have to deal with the after math the kids who dont get a father anymore for no reason. That must have been so painful.

Either way, an innocent life is lost and the guy left behind two kids and his wife. The most pathetic thing about it that the murderer killed himself afterwards. What a coward! Hell is definitely a place for people of this caliber.	7.0	7.0	26	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	2	train	859	Sadness

All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while. I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters. Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats. The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats. Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats? For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?
