It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	936	Hope/Sadness

I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing	3.5	5.5	38	2	6	1	35	148000	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	1	train	307	Hope/Sadness

Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason. This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.

The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it. The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do. This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process. And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.

A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water.

Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.
