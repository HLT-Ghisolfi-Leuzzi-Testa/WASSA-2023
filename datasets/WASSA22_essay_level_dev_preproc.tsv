Terrible and I thought airports had better security than to let a man with a gun get there and be able to kill someone. It's so crazy nowadays that you aren't safe anywhere.

It is not the gun it is something wrong inside the person who is doing the shooting. You can't expect the gun to be blamed when it is someone who is just pissed off or mental ill. If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments. I just hope we finally wake up to the fact that the gun didn't do it it was the person holding the gun.

An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing.

It is also very sad when teachers and administrators prey on young kids that they mentor or teach. They are robbing these kids of the ability to fully sexually develop in a healthy manner and in some cases they are emotionally scarring these children for life. Cases like these should carry very lengthy prison sentences in my opinion.	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	55000.0	4.0	4.875	sadness	5.5	6.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	3.286	3.143	3.143	83	1993	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.32142857142857145	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	3.202375504530831	3.1203926121525516	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I don't understand how people like this exist. It is alarming that social workers and other were not able to detect what was going on. The child was obviously being abused underneath everyone's eyes and no one did anything about it.

We've accomplished nothing since driving Osama out of Afghanistan 17 years ago. It's gonna be generations of war and loss of innocent life for nothing. Well, I guess it creates more terrorists which gives the military something to do, but that's hardly a good result.	1.0	2.0	1.0	43.0	160000.0	1.0	1.375	sadness	6.0	3.0	2.0	4.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	1.429	2.714	68	2057	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.17857142857142858	0.14285714285714285	0.10714285714285714	0.0	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	2.493287595668095	2.2799439364096687	low	low	An essay written by a 43.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 160000.0$.

I always think of their families or friends or partners. Those women were someone's person. People had their person taken away for no reason. I can't imagine how heartbreaking that must feel. If I lost my husband like that I don't know how I would even go on. Especially being civilians like that and dying in their home. They probably thought they were safe. I wonder what they thought in the last moments. Did they know they were in danger, could they hear signs? Did they know for sure they were going to die or did they have hope that they might make it? Did they shelter together and comfort each other and try to be brave?

I knew some of the points but definitely didn't realize a woman always had a male guardian. I didn't realize if her husband died, her son could become her guardian. Where is the dignity in that? Can you imagine how bad it would feel to need permission to work, go to school, rent an apartment, do anything you want basically? And to need to get permission from your own child? Imagine rasing a child, feeding him, chaging his diapers, teaching him how to act... and then suddenly needing that child's permission to do anything or have to get his signature on anything.

Statistically speaking--i.e. RATIONALLY speaking--it is absurd to be afraid of terrorism.  And yet intelligent people are.  They see the world too much through their phones, through the images (images, not tangible things) depicted on it.  The world that exists in our phones does not exist in reality.

I'd be sad if he died, even though he doesn't really have anything to do with me and it's sort of silly to grieve a celebrity's death.  But I guess his movies represent some of my youth, so his identity represents some of my own as well.  I'm a little confused why he seems to be denying statements about his failing health, as if it's important to make people think he's healthy.  I don't understand it either way.  Why not just keep it private either way?  But whatever.

To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.

That's absolutely ludicrous and pretty insulting to women.  Do men need to be married to rule?  Of course not!  Why is it not the same for women leaders?  The only thing I gained when I got married was another child, in the form of a grown man.	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0	3.833	4.625	anger	6.5	5.5	2.0	6.5	4.0	4.571000000000001	3.0	4.0	4.2860000000000005	77	2122	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.0	0.2	0.08	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.18181818181818182	2.4858219028380297	2.483849738853342	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

I understand that Obama supports that something needs to change, but there is other evidence out there that shows that this is naturally occurring and something that will right itself in time.  I do agree that we need to cut back on our excessive use of electricity.  A little knowledge and everyday self-awareness would likely help us go in the right direction.  I just don't think it's a big cause of concern right now personally.	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0	1.833	2.375	neutral	4.0	6.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	3.857	4.143	4.2860000000000005	3.286	83	2127	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6284443127835777	2.595367534885462	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 93000.0$.

I don't agree with comparing Trump to the Hitler era though.  He hasn't set up concentration camps, and it was quite an exaggeration.  No matter the outcome of the election, there would have been uproar from some outliers that would rebel and graffiti.  Everyone in America deserves to have a voice though, and their concerns were done in a peaceful way, which I appreciate.	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0	1.833	1.375	joy	4.0	6.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	3.857	4.143	4.2860000000000005	3.286	84	2128	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.1875	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	2.5218565596801814	2.3412059269283487	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 93000.0$.

I am in awe of the women in Iceland that have the courage to leave work early on this day in a demonstration.  Their perseverance to continue to protest peacefully is making a chance, albeit a small one based on the percentages.
