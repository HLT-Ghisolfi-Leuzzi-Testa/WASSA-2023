5.833333333333333	5.5	I just read an article about the contamination of the Doce river in Brazil. Are there no lengths that man won't go to in order to voice his contempt for nature? An entire river has been rendered fruitless because of man's greed and irresponsibility. Whole livelihoods have been cut short and a once rich and vibrant place has been bathed in the sludge of industry. Why aren't we responding to this kind of thing in an organized fashion?	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	78	1609	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.2941176470588235	0.0588235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.347382403109132	2.2540883009187267	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around. To date, the world has a total of 30.1 million km2, or around 20 percent of the world’s land area, that remain as wilderness, with the majority being located in countries in North America, North Asia, Australia and Nort	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	130	648	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.7576904942460643	2.5433314487504117	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

We need to reduce the amount of chickens being slaughtered in a whole and a full stop to ""conscious chicken killings"".  The extent of chickens being exposed to such a stunned death is a result of lack of regulation in the chicken industry.  Animal groups need to lobby and face congress on this for the welfare of chickens and any other animals facing the same process of killing. I blame the U.S Department of Agriculture for even allowing this type of murder to have ever started.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

5.0	5.375	I saw this news item about a shooting in North Philly. Is this near where you live? Damn, I am so sick of gun violence. Will it ever end? Every day, it seems to be something new. Here in Detroit, we see it all the time and I know you're in a similar situation in Philadelphia. The article doesn't give any details about the victims or anything like that. It almost dehumanizes people, don't you think? I mean, these victims were somebody's relatives. Hopefully more details will come out in future articles. The news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details. I know I am rambling here. But all this gun violence is too much.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	128	525	0.2272727272727272	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.4815766002332627	2.4450120350946447	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

At first I thought it was a typo, and it was suppose to be die, but it indeed was talking about someone taking a coconut pie, and slamming it into the face of people. The act seems pretty innocent to me, and is almost sad that he is going to have to face some jail time along with the beating from the security. Obviously, you cant go around doing this, but it is tough not to laugh.	sadness	1.0	6.0	6.0	23.0	55000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.0	1.857	3.571	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	96	403	0.1212121212121212	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.1515151515151515	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.125	2.8230728267538168	2.7308606763124144	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

I've started to pull out my phone camera whenever I see the cops talking to someone, especially if they are a minority. Police brutality is such a problem in our country and it's just so deeply ingrained in the system, I'm not sure what can be done.

These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals! They need to be psychologically stable and clear of racial bias, otherwise they are not suitable for this job!	anger	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	129	1168	0.1052631578947368	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.1403508771929824	0.0701754385964912	0.2105263157894736	0.1228070175438596	0.087719298245614	0.0526315789473684	0.0701754385964912	0.0714285714285714	3.186521112139404	3.1287676426196693	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000.0$.

They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	31500.0	4.5	4.0	1.5	3.0	2.0	2.143	3.429	3.143	2.4290000000000003	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	74	339	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.0769230769230769	2.343570702841295	2.3702111880019787	low	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31500.0$.

There is a monster in the white House that a majority of the people did not elect and the Russian government had a hand in coming to power.

I find the article describing it to be absurd, however.  Describing a Wildlife Services program in the way it did was over-the-top.  Besides, I always find these perspectives backwards: people who are seemingly more concerned about the welfare of animals than people.

People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons. Some people buy beauty products in hopes of achieving a state of happiness or a sense of self beauty or as an act or expression of beauty	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	129	300	0.0	0.0	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.4	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.32	0.064516129032258	3.017991886307053	2.80709984054877	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief.

There is so many things wrong with the American system of adopting children from other countries.  If we are going to adopt children from other countries as Americans, they should be granted their citizenship immediately upon being adopted. Before another adoption takes place that involves American parents, and innocent children from another country, there needs to be new rules, regulations, and laws mandated for the protection of these children and families of what can be deemed as a sloppy American adoption system.

In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

It was all over some petty comments made, which apparently turned to racist slurs and got someone thrown out fo a building. Of course, everything is he said she said so I can't tell who was really wrong in this situation.

You've got to wonder how long Europe is going to let refugees in when crimes such as sexual assault and such are on the rise and everytime they catch the person it's yet another refugee who came here to just keep living the same crappy way that ruined their home.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	35.0	145000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	1.5	7.0	2.286	1.0	2.4290000000000003	1.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	80	1568	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.2916666666666667	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.7995631843343136	2.7747062574950623	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 145000.0$.

5.667000000000001	1.0	Just read an article about the situation in Haiti a month after the hurricane. Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too. Somehow we have to figure out better relief efforts for natural disasters.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	62.0	5500.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	105	925	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.9639654974634384	2.622677973711621	medium	low	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 5500.0$.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions. The target is to keep temperature rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	129	217	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0	2.565794993410829	2.545485810700536	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

But often times we forget about the many pressures and responsibilities that come a long with that.  Take Mikhail Lesin for example.  The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.  I guess thats a price you have to pay if you make enemies in the world.  You are either looking over your shoulder all the time or completely stressed to death.

5.332999999999999	6.625	It's almost funny because I was looking at something really similar to this on Steve Wilkos, that a baby got hurt after pushing through a window screen and Steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so negligent and a bad mom but I honestly think that it's not the parents fault. Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	140	457	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

2.667	3.0	I just read another story about American soldiers deaths at the hands of terrorists. What upsets me the most about reading it is thinking about their families. I wonder if they had children that will have to grow up without them. I think about wives and their parents and how those peoples' lives have now changed forever. I think about how upset I would be if my son grew up to join the military. I would be a mess.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	50000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	2.0	3.0	2.286	3.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	79	200	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	2.8256757861803816	2.866759322180743	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

2.0	3.875	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	137	1631	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.4230769230769231	0.1923076923076923	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0	2.3201376604620663	2.411814748980693	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously.

Charge them as accomplices to murder.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	40000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	85	734	0.1842105263157894	0.1842105263157894	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0	2.744841648284802	2.970128069680146	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

2.5	3.875	Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very interesting and somewhat disturbing article. It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	sadness	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	76	258	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0227272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.1590909090909091	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.0227272727272727	0.0555555555555555	2.8295488007595484	2.826317539259576	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

I do find it hilarious that this is happening in California, where they seem so concerned about every possible social issue under the sun, especially taking care of people who are here illegally, yet there are parts of the state where actual citizens can't drink the water like they're living in a third world nation. Then again, given Commiefornia's stated desire to secede, they might get to live their third world dream.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	43.0	48000.0	6.0	3.5	2.5	3.5	7.0	3.429	1.0	3.571	2.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	98	1304	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.1176470588235294	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0	2.53773651416536	2.480229954236326	low	low	An essay written by a 43.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000.0$.

Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

This whole thing about getting an IUD now because Trump will make birth control unaffordable in the near future is ridiculous. Just another issue to get people stirred up. Most Trump supporters are conservative when it comes to economic issues but moderately liberal when it concerns social issues. Big changes in birth control, same sex marriages, abortion, and women’s rights are not going to happen.

I doubt after moving to multiple houses that you would not have noticed something was off. I mean you never went into these closets?

These young men were out doing something they absolutely loved and doing it with their closest friends, and now they don't have the opportunity to grow old and continue to enjoy many more things to come. They were so young and had their whole lives ahead of them. I can't imagine how their families are feeling right now. Hug your little ones a little tighter tonight.	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	37.0	29999.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.714	4.143	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	97	172	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.119047619047619	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.2	3.1694231073325607	3.043384362289024	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 29999.0$.

4.5	5.75	I can't believe we live in a world where terrorism—both domestic and foreign—are such a looming threat. Being out in public now more dangerous than ever, and it's all because of the convoluted sociological web of conservative ideology that has promoted domestic terrorism in white heterosexual   American masculinity and the xenophobia that inspired Islamic terrorism. There's just too damned much hate in this world, and hopefully more people will find love and nurturing like the author of this book found while writing about her trauma.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	44000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	85	149	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.025	0.15	0.175	0.075	0.075	0.1	0.0	2.763179298913655	2.725666966743614	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

Infants, middle schoolers, high schoolers… It is not easy for kids to be kids, to depend on parents who are also struggle with their problems and issues. The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	45.0	120000.0	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	99	878	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.1875	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0526315789473684	3.106904931146496	2.819032547078313	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000.0$.

Today with social media we just see the problems more out in front since nothing is private anymore. I'm older 63 as you know and my mom and granny taught me how to behave. Don't go into a room with some man you don't know. If he tries something tell someone. All these ladies who kept quiet or were paid off in some way are just as big a part of the problem as any man who abuses them.

She cashed in and got a lot of fame. I can't say I really feel that sorry for her. If it was me I would have just said, ""no"" and moved on.

People aren't even trying to hide their racism anymore, and they're intentionally making shit worse to justify their oppressive agendas.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	44000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	53	147	0.25	0.1785714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.25	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.411828661643763	2.5992469681213097	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

The residents are understandably upset because they will lose their homes, but will likely be compensated.

All of this violence is being spurred on by US backed Saudi violence. I am a firm believer that the US should keep its tendrils out of international conflict.

1.6669999999999998	5.625	After reading this article on some of the federal prisons, I am extremely upset about the treatment of prisoners in these facilities. The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons. We seriously need to do something about these conditions.	anger	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	126	1021	0.1304347826086956	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1739130434782608	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1	2.887471641540525	2.935960670048317	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.

3.667	4.625	This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

Some may think they are doing good things trying to get people to a better place, but these traffickers do not see people and are wanting to help them.  They see them as money, they take advantage of them and take every single thing they can from them while promising them a better life.  They do not care about the safety of people and are just trying to maximize their profits.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them.

I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to shame anyone into conversion therapy. I cannot stand Mike Pence and everything he stands for.

Further more, it is an ideology that promotes violence and terrorism. Until people become less tolerant of this disgusting dogma, things like this will continue to happen. If muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west, they need to work on reforming their religion from within.	sadness	2.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	24000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.5	2.5	3.286	3.143	2.4290000000000003	2.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	80	306	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	2.878356035645947	2.8620711569571	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 24000.0$.

People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	128	185	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.064516129032258	2.976505059449956	2.831572665407568	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

We should learn to recognize that as a society, we must come to understand the universal nature of suffering as applicable to all people. One's status in life should not leave them any more open to suffering than others.	sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	150000.0	4.0	6.0	5.0	6.0	5.5	3.143	3.0	3.143	2.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	264	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.16	0.16	0.04	0.0769230769230769	2.766738456449409	2.607396614486841	low	low	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

A requester asks for an obnoxious amount of work and couples it with a short timer on the task.   Then they want the work for free and good feedback.  Do they get it?   Do they get good work for free? I dunno.

Every time I hear about one of these animal escapes I get the feeling that someone is going to end up killing the animal; I expect either an officer with legal authority or some stupid maniac with a gun who wants to kill something exotic is going to end up shooting it. I thought I saw a wild bird like run across the road one morning when I was driving to work. It wasn't big enough to be an emu but it was similar.

1.0	3.875	Global warming and fires and now being considered to be linked to one another. While being a resident of California, this to me is not surprising.  Unfortunately we as a nation need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment.  Even worse is now we have a president who in his own words feel as though global warming is just a fabrication.  This is going to cost us more money in the fire fighting department and we are going to see way worse side affects from this problem.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	24.0	50000.0	6.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.714	3.714	4.857	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	96	226	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.037037037037037	0.0	3.0072353416427293	3.012059407467874	low	medium	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 50000.0$.

4.5	4.625	Sleep is very important, and I’m quite sure you know that already. However, some aspects of life–like habits, even smartphones, and stress in work–affect our sleep cycles. A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

Optimistically, the situation will take a positive turn.	hope/sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	150000.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.286	3.857	3.0	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	78	2201	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.2352941176470588	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.7251545489214	2.6071222029650083	medium	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

First I would say Issa never receded his support for Trump after the Infamous Hollywood Access recording.  For somebody who preach's morals its kind of hypocritical.  Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests. He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection. This guy has no morals and should not be supported for his constant flip flopping."	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	125000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	3.429	3.286	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	108	963	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.0689655172413793	0.2758620689655172	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0	2.449754519757445	2.384394773479629	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 125000.0$.

I have never worked at a bank before, but being told to reach a quota, even by the means of doing illegal tasks to accomplish what they needed to do. I can't imagine coming into working everyday and wondering if I was going to be considered a good or a bad employee. It would infuriate me to have earned a bonus and then be told I cannot have it because I am being developed as an employee. I am glad they decided to make the change.

A formal apology is the very least the Canadian government can do, and it is admirable.	disgust	1.0	2.0	3.0	23.0	25000.0	5.5	6.5	1.0	1.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	2.857	3.143	1.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	55	639	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.1	2.531997801049707	2.5072241861726794	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old black or african american male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.667000000000001	5.0	I just read an article about an infant orangutan, that was so sad. There had been several orangutans rescued from an illegal dealer. They were taken to a rescue center. The infant orangutan all of a sudden collapsed in her cage. She has meningitis which can be deadly for her. She is getting amazing care at this center though, so I sure hope she pulls through. I have no extra money right now but you can donate to this organization!	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	80	246	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.1224489795918367	0.1428571428571428	0.1836734693877551	0.0612244897959183	0.0612244897959183	0.0408163265306122	0.1224489795918367	0.1538461538461538	3.1097552719959496	3.0016252856565315	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I often question how it is that I, another random human in this mixed up shit-hole we call ""Planet Earth"", can have unlimited empathy (to the level that I won't even squash a bug) and other people will go out of their way to run over an animal crossing the road. Humans can be rather sadistic and disgusting individuals.

Trump is not against renewable power, he just wants a free market and he is right. The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward. The Paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a boon for the liberals who dream of an elite class ruling the world.	disgust	1.0	5.0	1.0	41.0	68500.0	6.5	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.857	3.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	95	359	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.2857142857142857	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0454545454545454	2.831473924846536	2.785350695050864	low	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 68500.0$.

Plus I read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and doesn't get reflected.

I consider that the war does not solve anything, it has not done it before and neither will it now.	anger	1.0	5.0	1.0	23.0	53000.0	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	115	961	0.1666666666666666	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.125	2.636556777912576	2.484232563194868	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 53000.0$.

1.0	2.75	This story makes me feel upset and aggravated because I hate that it is so easy to obtain guns in this country. I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings. I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried. I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	116	283	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.3043478260869565	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.873318764423922	2.927632080674066	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.

Can you ensure me that you will be okay? I am worried about you and want to maker sure you're okay. Hopefully your missionary work will yield good results.

I would hate to think that I had to have a male escort when I left my home. They aren't treated as equals, and often men don't even consider them equal as their family pet! &lt;Many of the women can be abused, physically and sexually, and they are considered to be the problem, not the abuser! I hope they are able to win by the petition, and will be able to have a bit more freedom!	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	107	98	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0909090909090909	2.931899764178178	2.838940674488265	medium	low	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.

And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	anger/neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	134	2152	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

TMZ broke the story ... the couple's marriage was on the rocks last November.

Just having a shocking video that raises awareness doesn't help the problem from starting, just helps us react to it quicker.

I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

The only way someone should be stopped or removed from their flights is if they displayed violent behavior or if they were trying to board with weapons. It is not acceptable at all for someone to be barred from their flight due to the color of their skin or their religious or ethnic background. Those who have been discriminated against for these reasons are suffering undue embarrassment and inconvenience. They should be compensated for this unfair treatment and the airlines should be fined heavily.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	52.0	51000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	5.5	4.0	3.286	3.429	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	99	1545	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.2692307692307692	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.0	2.930272373926084	2.893700873208173	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

I think that there should be more training for all pilots who deal in these acrobatic flying routines. I also think that women have just as much of a right to become a fighter pilot as men.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	39000.0	7.0	6.5	5.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	4.143	4.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	321	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.4166666666666667	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	3.1578898117086465	2.845825377831427	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 39000.0$.

The article was about polar bears and the problems they are facing due to the shorter ice season in recent years. It is very troubling because the bears are suffering and dying due to the shortened ice seasons.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

So many children died, just because they were born into the ""wrong"" culture. This mentality, unfortunately, isn't isolated or gone from planet.

Near total distrust of the local government from segments of the local Muslim population, it's really shocking and concerning to me. The Rohingya apparently aren't even allowed to worship at their mosques, nor are they allowed to go to work to earn a living. It's very concerning to me that I hear a member of the government seemingly unconcerned about how these people are being treated. Enough isn't being done, not nearly enough, by almost all parities involved, to hear some of the stories of what is happening on the ground is really heart breaking.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	48000.0	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	1208	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.1578947368421052	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0454545454545454	2.665963716400181	2.5467733268271724	medium	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000.0$.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

I flinch when i hear the words ""suicide bomber"" on the news, so reading about people being dragged into the city to be used as human sheilds was too much.

Anyways, this article is illustrating the harm of over pumping water sources in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

3.833	1.0	Just read a short article about the Kim Kardashian robbery.  Pretty scary for her, and the robbers kept demanding money.  There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.  I hope that she gets better security in place so that this never happens again.  The article mentioned her providing information about her expensive diamond ring on Facebook - I think there's a lesson to be learned about that.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	40000.0	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	79	668	0.0294117647058823	0.088235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.2058823529411764	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.0625	2.748191450461277	2.422881137452516	medium	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

1.0	1.625	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation. It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	136	281	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

There was even a quote from Elton John talking about how influential Russel was in his own life, and the impact he had on his stardom.	sadness	1.0	6.0	6.0	23.0	55000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.0	1.857	3.571	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	68	402	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.3636363636363636	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.90083466789893	2.454685141119178	medium	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

5.0	2.25	Reading this article makes me upset. I hate what we do to native people. It seems as a society we seem to ignore their feelings and traditions just to move ourselves forward. We forget that we intruded onto their land to make ourselves homes that we enjoy yet we can't offer them the same good feeling. To even think that the option of having dangerous amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me.	anger	2.0	6.0	5.0	33.0	51000.0	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	75	1081	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	2.9533733377217177	2.913727935388549	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000.0$.

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

1.5	1.875	I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday. A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

Sometimes the articles have so many names of places I don't recognize and can't pronounce that I get a little off track of the point of the article. I gues those terrorists are using people as human shields to keep and take control or surroundings areas. They know this is against UN policy, but I doubt they care. There is always something going on in the Middle East, it seems nothing gets better for the people just trying to live. I feel like something should be done to improve the situation, but it's been bad since I was a kid and I doubt it'll get better.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	42.0	70500.0	6.0	2.0	2.5	4.0	4.0	3.143	3.143	3.429	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	118	331	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.51010399368267	2.339573797015446	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70500.0$.

It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have. As for human rights, it’s always uncertain.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	4000.0	6.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	3.286	3.286	3.857	2.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	100	427	0.0967741935483871	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0909090909090909	3.29174545168244	3.0966170841260285	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 4000.0$.

And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

While they may not have the same protections that the accused have in the United States, they should still give her a new trial, something quiet, out of the public eye, maybe even outside of the country, where she can get a fair trial based on the facts. If there is video of her spiking the coffee, or any indication that she has had any contact with cyanide, then I say she should get a retrial.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	50.0	96000.0	6.0	2.5	1.5	4.0	7.0	1.429	1.143	3.429	1.286	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	1156	0.125	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.667586750609648	2.63781030308241	low	low	An essay written by a 50.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 96000.0$.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	149	455	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.1379310344827586	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.785816318850275	2.7220543145719054	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

No, our inner cities aren’t war zones with record crime. No, we aren’t the highest-taxed nation in the world. No, climate change isn’t a hoax promoted by the Chinese. So if you’re tempted to concede that the alt-right’s vision of the world might have some truth to it, don’t. Lies are lies, no matter how much power backs them up.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will.

The last time I checked, Donald Trump has not interred 15 million Jews to concentration camps where he has killed them. Typical liberal Democrat with so much hyperbole.

Stop having children you can't feed.  These countries are all grossly overpopulated but they keep having kids.

I don't have time to discuss all issues, obviously, but I'll just say this.  To all the people who feel like helping low-income citizens is the be-all-end-all of government and societal purpose, I ask just one question: What have any of those people done to deserve better outcomes? What have they done to deserve to share in the wealth of the wealthy?  What have they done to deserve free healthcare?  What have they done to deserve handouts?  Wealth doesn't magically fall form the sky and some people are just more greedy than others.  Entitlement doesn't produce better outcomes; it produces more entitlement.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.428999999999999	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	122	1573	0.0285714285714285	0.1142857142857142	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0	0.2285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1818181818181818	2.568093060720685	2.4210217316585747	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police.

If the police are willing to give ""criminals"" over to the drug cartels, I'm pretty sure they aren't above lying about it.  One of my coworkers hasn't visited her family in years because their state has become so crime ridden they won't let her come home.  They say it isn't safe for her.  How stupid sad is that?

They also spend a lot of time online, especially on YouTube. The videos on there are more influential, since they are real people, and the ads are more convincing. The article made me not want to let the kids watch YouTube or go online, which is really hard to do.

It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here.

So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go.

7.0	1.5	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents. I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect.

I hope they all get the food that they need.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	77	1586	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.1470588235294117	0.1176470588235294	0.088235294117647	0.2352941176470588	0.088235294117647	0.088235294117647	0.0	0.2058823529411764	0.1428571428571428	3.312795615473694	3.1052871674743683	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

You can't expect the gun to be blamed when it is someone who is just pissed off or mental ill. If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments. I just hope we finally wake up to the fact that the gun didn't do it it was the person holding the gun.

The only things that really stood out were the story of the marathon runner and the swimmer because there were interesting stories attached to them.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	55000.0	2.5	4.5	2.5	4.0	1.5	2.857	3.429	4.714	3.286	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	66	475	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.1	0.1	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.0	2.859706225402783	2.503937718679429	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.3333333333333333	2.25	This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	anger/neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	134	2151	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.1707317073170731	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Their health is being affected and not only that, the enviroment is being completely abused.	sadness	2.0	5.0	2.0	41.0	60000.0	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	74	41	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.25	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	3.0053268659104684	2.9513831287001744	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	99	36	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.901869276182453	2.975700762759283	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

And let's face it America's hands aren't clean in the middle east, or Africa. America has learned nothing from past wars. We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral.

One bad day at school can triger a suicide attempt, that's crazy! Schools should do a much better job protecting children from bullying. I know that's impossible to eradicate it, but it schools and parents take the issue seriously enough, we could at least reduce the number of suicides.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	313	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1621621621621621	0.2162162162162162	0.1351351351351351	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.0	2.8591722010509635	2.9529105233635926	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

It seems like there's usually more to the story with refugee stories.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	55000.0	2.5	4.5	2.5	4.0	1.5	2.857	3.429	4.714	3.286	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	73	476	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.08	0.16	0.08	0.08	0.08	0.12	0.1538461538461538	2.6460366520574987	2.4046190747092724	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

What gives this person the right to take someone else life? Those people may have had children, mothers, sisters, friends, co-workers, and now they are dead, and for what?  How did this individual go so long without being apprehended.  Sometimes the system really confuses me and upsets me.

7.0	2.5	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.

I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	120	603	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

The way they act is beyond comprehension and I hope the media keeps exposing people who have bad intentions.	anger	1.0	5.0	5.0	31.0	80000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	5.0	1.571	3.0	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	67	568	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1333333333333333	2.844957953787493	2.978847945721378	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

I feel for those that were put out of work.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	52000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	2.0	5.5	1.143	1.286	2.286	2.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	81	289	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.1785714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0909090909090909	2.633171040552187	2.467648885650855	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 52000.0$.

5.167000000000001	6.625	I read an article about making the ivory trade legal, and it said it could cause the extinction of elephants. I find it extremely disturbing, since I can't imagine elephants being extinct. It makes me really angry that poachers are able to kill so many elephants, and that even if it's legal to trade ivory, the demand is still really high. I think finding a substitute for ivory is a better choice. No one actually needs ivory, and keeping it illegal seems like a better idea.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	21600.0	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	86	1235	0.0909090909090909	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.788153649383867	2.724759511808855	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600.0$.

Just because it didn't work romantically doesn't mean it won't work at all.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	75000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	6.5	6.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	3.571	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	11	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1	2.6511489489040483	2.4565019686484733	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

I think this story really made me think about that and brought fourth some really interesting facts and data that make you see how it is changing and hurting different parts of the world.

Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	124	215	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0256410256410256	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.0416666666666666	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life.

Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

3.833	4.375	I feel that it is a common thing to have intentions misplaced. The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

It is uncomfortable to see the divide that these situations shine a light on but in the end it is for the greater good. There needs to be major reforms in the policing sector that will eliminate the racial profiling that goes on but I am afraid that more hard will come before the good.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	30.0	30000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	88	1553	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1	0.0666666666666666	2.7654963336202525	2.768946218107315	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 30000.0$.

Even thought they weren't able to establish a specific link their has to be a link between PTSD and problems with sleeping given the huge consequences of PTSD.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	73	157	0.2	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0	3.0019764421973787	2.653616799334816	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

5.667000000000001	5.625	The dwindling wilderness is due, in part to humanity’s activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and of course, oil and gas exploration. The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	113	647	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	3.009758951199248	2.78106625686191	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

I have nothing against illegal immigrants either and often feel there should be pathways to citizenship so long as the illegal immigrant commits no wrongdoings and contributes to the success of the economy of the place they are staying in. The problem with Calais in France is that quite often, terrorists disguised as immigrants make their way in through this area and then commit acts of terror which harm French citizens. French people want to help those that have been displaced in the Middle East, but Calais is a mess.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	101	341	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0344827586206896	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0555555555555555	2.6907088215470587	2.667309494402865	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I believe most police officers are good people, but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many police departments. The protests were certainly justified. Police should be subjected to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism. Those that do need to be removed from active duty immediately.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	76000.0	5.5	1.5	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.857	3.571	3.571	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	71	674	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0333333333333333	0.0625	3.0866674371720566	3.032050342681197	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000.0$.

2.833	2.0	Hate seems to be increasing in this country. I just read an article that hate crimes are going up. I don't know what's going on but people can't seem to handle themselves and use restraint. People are becoming too short-fused and trigger happy on attacking others with hate crimes. I hope things get better but the article didn't seem too optimistic. I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored.

People are who they are in life and are not to be changed, but embraced and supported. The regimen these poor people had to go through in this so called therapy was barbaric, and would not be used in North Korea as a torture.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

2.167	3.875	It aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an opportunity to lead. It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	24500.0	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	128	1286	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0434782608695652	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500.0$.

I can put myself in the shoes of someone older and battling health problems and it saddens me to do so.	sadness	1.0	6.0	4.0	26.0	34000.0	6.5	6.5	5.0	4.0	7.0	3.429	2.143	3.286	2.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	352	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.1739130434782608	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0769230769230769	3.2280541166791745	3.0078784749624146	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 34000.0$.

Trying to convince him that Trump is a immoral person would've been a better use of her time. What makes me mad though, is that people called CPS on her. People always trying to get involved in everybody's business.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	70	312	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.1111111111111111	2.292478702393535	2.3942503423044403	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	133	1618	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.221881368561005	2.153175165945004	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the mouth over Obama being elected, and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending RIGHT NOW because a black man was in the white house. Now...I don't know. I see my friends and family freaking out and I want to tell them to just chill out. Obama didn't destroy America--the right wingers were wrong about that. Neither will Trump. Life will keep going. It brings a lot of stress listening to people freaking out all the time. And yet, I get it. I get why they are worried and freaking out. I don't like it either, but I don't get the point of stressing out so much. But then again, I've completely dissociated from all this.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure.

Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far.

He says his new slogan is Keep America Great, well, buddy, you got to make it great in the first place. He is one racist, misogynistic, egotistical liar and cannot wait till he leave, however way.	anger	2.0	4.0	2.0	34.0	25000.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	6.0	5.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	4.857	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	66	1176	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.25	0.15	0.15	0.05	0.0	2.30275488905283	2.468906824939604	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old hispanic or latino female, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again.

These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Men should have the ability to take birth control in their own hands, as they never know if a woman is lieing about taking her's or if they have been taking it properly. An added protection could never hurt for both parties. I, however, do not feel very sympathetic. I think women are always looking for things to complain about, and this is just another thing. Women, get over it. If your side effects from your birth control are too strong, then just don't have sex.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	34000.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	4.5	1.5	4.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	113	1474	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1515151515151515	0.0	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.78421836330545	2.6997879597824745	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 34000.0$.

I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

People today are so interested in themselves, and selfies, and social media, that they often miss the real world around them.  This man was literally bit by a snake, and still posted the selfie, and was more worried about how many ""likes"" he would get rather than his snake bite.

What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature.

It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

2.5	1.375	I hear the British Government is looking to drill for oil again. This time they are looking to drill near the Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda. Everyone is so dependent on oil all the time. Too bad for some giraffes that live there as they will be displaced. Of course I could really care less about giraffes 5000 miles away from me. Still I wish the giraffes the best I suppose. Brits are such weasels it figures they would look to kill a bunch of giraffes for their own selfish gains. Governments all stink.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	61.0	18000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	3.286	1.571	3.143	3.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	95	1369	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	2.52737896777268	2.44036924252324	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 18000.0$.

1.0	1.875	I think protests these days are getting out of hand. It's one thing if people want to protest peacefully, but it's another if they are damaging property and being aggressive and dangerous. I believe people should have a right to protest, but some laws must be in place. If you can't follow them there will need to be consequences.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	37.0	72000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	59	1232	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.4	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.628144361699641	2.7459048963231143	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

1.0	1.0	I just read this article about a scandal involving a person trying to rent a place from someone else, but then it turned out that this person was using it for personal reasons because the place the other person was renting wasn't own bu the person they thought.
