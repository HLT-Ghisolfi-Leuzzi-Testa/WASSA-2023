Is it really worth to throw away years of experiences down the drain just to have fun with a random stranger for a night?

1.0	1.0	Environmentalism at its core is a racket. The leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to guilt you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while majority of this money goes towards these non-profit organizations that help them push thier agenda. These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal. By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.	neutral	1.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	45000.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	108	820	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.861190685362936	2.84778427910004	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

It does sound kinda like an unnecessary death but I guess she knew the risks when she decided to become a fighter pilot.  It seems like a dangerous profession and like these things could easily happen.  I guess they could easily be avoided just by avoiding this career altogether but anyway.  It is what it is.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

1.5	1.0	The sadness surrounding this situation is undeniable, and I sincerely hope that effective actions will be taken. It pains me to witness the innocent wildlife suffering unjustly. It is crucial for the government to allocate more resources and make concentrated efforts to address and improve this predicament. While I acknowledge the challenges associated with resource allocation, it is worth exploring small-scale initiatives that can have a meaningful impact. The peril faced by the ecosystem underscores the pressing need for someone to take swift action on behalf of the defenseless animals who are the victims of this distressing situation.	hope/sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	98	2219	0.1363636363636363	0.0227272727272727	0.0681818181818181	0.1818181818181818	0.0227272727272727	0.2045454545454545	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0227272727272727	0.0681818181818181	0.0833333333333333	3.010936897525394	2.9750873542582976	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong.

People are dying from lack of fresh air and water, and it is wrong.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	42.0	105000.0	6.0	6.5	3.0	6.5	2.5	3.714	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	72	319	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0	3.384624789513817	3.1621703631302385	medium	high	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 105000.0$.

The sheer sadness emanates from the fact that he was selflessly helping his family by engaging in crop harvesting when he tragically fell. The profound misfortune is intensified by his tender age and the vast opportunities that lay ahead of him. I sincerely hope that his parents can find solace and forge ahead in life with tranquility.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	76	2217	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0294117647058823	0.1764705882352941	0.0294117647058823	0.2941176470588235	0.1470588235294117	0.1176470588235294	0.0294117647058823	0.1176470588235294	0.0476190476190476	2.8269891999753485	2.705243036511774	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

I am shocked there were no charges against him	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	4.0	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	72	1723	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.764304375962138	2.785239636517264	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings. I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried. I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	116	283	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.3043478260869565	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.873318764423922	2.927632080674066	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

4.5	4.625	Sleep is very important, and I’m quite sure you know that already. However, some aspects of life–like habits, even smartphones, and stress in work–affect our sleep cycles. A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently came across a truly intriguing yet profoundly disheartening article. It revolved around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What amazed me was that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It's remarkable to imagine running an entire magazine at such a tender age. However, her life was marked by a long-standing battle with depression, which she chronicled in a book. Struggling with her mental health, she was admitted to a mental hospital for treatment.

5.0	3.125	This article is something i can really agree with. I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	128	2157	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.681165264634731	2.6242989345013825	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

But, you can rebuild your life with your family.	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	52000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	2.0	5.5	1.143	1.286	2.286	2.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	74	287	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.1944444444444444	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0	3.065326045874711	2.898565479393922	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 52000.0$.

It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it. I can only begin to imagine what our veterans are going thrugh.

I know that's impossible to eradicate it, but it schools and parents take the issue seriously enough, we could at least reduce the number of suicides.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	313	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1621621621621621	0.2162162162162162	0.1351351351351351	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.0	2.8591722010509635	2.9529105233635926	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

People that leave negative comments on celebrity pages are taking it to a new level.  People say the shittiest things to each other when they're hiding behind their computer screen.

It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.

5.0	5.625	"I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.

It seems that more and more this happens and people are not teaching their children how to treat other people.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	93	1776	0.125	0.125	0.1	0.05	0.075	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.075	0.2727272727272727	3.097567384126881	3.0439116504970345	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

As you know, I firmly believe in the importance of environmental protections and think climate change is a problem.  However, articles like this only add to the problem.  These numbers are shocking on the surface but could easily be explained by natural fluctuations year to year.

They were merely fulfilling their job responsibilities when this unfortunate explosion, caused by sheer carelessness, resulted in the loss of their lives. It is truly tragic that the awareness of the life-threatening and unsafe working conditions did not prompt immediate closure. Although I am glad that around 1,000 establishments are scheduled for closure, I strongly believe that more comprehensive measures are required. The formation of a council and the implementation of regulations, similar to the US's OSHA, should be prioritized to safeguard workers and ensure the strict adherence to safety measures for the preservation of human life. As a consequence of the failure to act promptly, families are now left without their sons, fathers, and a source of income that could have been easily avoided. I earnestly hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	145	2207	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.125	0.0357142857142857	0.0892857142857142	0.054054054054054	2.9157967974667645	2.795032757138069	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street.

French people want to help those that have been displaced in the Middle East, but Calais is a mess.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	101	341	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0344827586206896	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0555555555555555	2.6907088215470587	2.667309494402865	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

The infant orangutan all of a sudden collapsed in her cage. She has meningitis which can be deadly for her. She is getting amazing care at this center though, so I sure hope she pulls through.

Now, Al-Aqaeda is also a group of mentally ill people and they're also disgusting but they're damn serious in their mission. ISIS feels like a group of guys who kill just for fun. I agree with Obama on ISIS being a jv team. I can't help but feel terrible for those who have to witness the bodies all over Mosul. What a horrible sight that must be. Can people heal once they see that? Do those people have any hope or any way to continue after they witness such atrocities? What about the children? I feel so bad for them. It's so crazy. I wish they would wipe out the Middle East and just start over. Enough with the political correct bullshit.

The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	45.0	120000.0	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	99	878	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.1875	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0526315789473684	3.106904931146496	2.819032547078313	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000.0$.

I've already spent more time thinking about them than they will ever think about me.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	30000.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	4.0	2.143	3.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	68	163	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0769230769230769	2.507963926060702	2.351380279339801	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

After reading multiple articles today about just how shitty people can be to one another, it makes me beyond happy to know the individuals that are in my own personal life.   Human greed knows no bounds.  Human ego needs to be set aside and/or destroyed.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	66	239	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.217391304347826	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.1538461538461538	2.8398983056425275	2.7454933257282392	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

Everyone deserves to live a happy life without being assaulted or worried that they'll be assaulted. And chalking it up to religion is even worse. People don't have to be so easily offended these days, but they are, and they're hate filled while they're offended too.	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	27000.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	1.714	4.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	73	486	0.1153846153846153	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0714285714285714	2.7670556202599093	2.914123251062629	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 27000.0$.

Every time I hear about one of these animal escapes I get the feeling that someone is going to end up killing the animal; I expect either an officer with legal authority or some stupid maniac with a gun who wants to kill something exotic is going to end up shooting it. I thought I saw a wild bird like run across the road one morning when I was driving to work. It wasn't big enough to be an emu but it was similar.

Their ineffable ineptitude constantly leads to environmental disasters and someone has to put a stop to their BS before we let them completely destroy our habitat here on Earth.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	44000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	60	145	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.630262825461545	2.6802911240046727	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

Some would say it is because of the religious beliefs in the area but America is no better.  In our own backyard women can be raped and forced into carrying the baby to term as the father has ""rights.""

5.0	5.0	This article really brings you back down to earth. It shows everything in science is not correct and there is still much for us to learn. It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	136	1593	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.24	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.0526315789473684	2.9615192213757	2.7765868181672064	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation.	hope/sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	93	1589	0.15625	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.09375	0.125	2.921052661132437	2.8826445785555053	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Having come across an article detailing the latest events in Germany, a country that was once known for welcoming immigrants, it is disheartening to see the current toughened approach.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors.

Besides, the lawsuit is filed but there is no verdict yet, so Mayweather could be innocent.  Anyone can file a lawsuit and the only proof of who is right is when the suit is decided.  I will be interested to follow the outcome of this one.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	65.0	34500.0	6.5	4.0	1.5	6.0	6.5	4.2860000000000005	1.429	4.714	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	71	586	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.1	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.15	0.15	0.0	0.0	2.6093864713606103	2.5200216597219733	low	low	An essay written by a 65.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 34500.0$.

5.5	6.0	There was some anti jewish graffitti in my community after trumps election too. I think these jewish feeling were feeling like a lot of us after trumps election, like America wasn't a safe place to be anymore. He opened it up to racism, sexism, and bigotry. Not that those weren't already there, but he made it seem like those were okay. I felt like that as a woman, and I talked to other women who did too, like you. It felt like these people felt, like suddenly it was okay to harrass women, because the president does it too.	fear	2.0	7.0	1.0	55.0	10000.0	6.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	6.0	3.571	2.0	3.571	4.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	99	728	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.1851851851851851	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	2.750622912152568	2.622715995554449	medium	low	An essay written by a 55.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 10000.0$.

5.0	5.0	This article serves as a stark reminder of the realities we face. It highlights the fallibility of scientific understanding and the vast amount of knowledge that remains elusive to us. It is disconcerting to realize that these animals were previously unaware carriers of the disease, and now there is a possibility that genetic mutations have caused its spread among their population. The suffering endured by these creatures is undeniably heart-wrenching, with no means for them to alleviate their pain. I sincerely hope that further research is conducted to identify ways to halt the disease's progression before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I am grateful for the conservationist who brought attention to this issue, prompting others to voice their concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	123	2230	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0638297872340425	0.1276595744680851	0.0425531914893617	0.2127659574468085	0.1702127659574468	0.1063829787234042	0.0851063829787234	0.0425531914893617	0.032258064516129	2.8717645779290875	2.759347575690394	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

I know that bigots are not a particularly new species, but I used to think, just a few years ago, that things were much better and that people were generally becoming more open-minded and welcoming. But the election of our new president signals something very different. And very much encourages the bigots to spread their wings and parade proudly. They are being empowered right now, and that is very disturbing.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	57.0	135000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.857	1.571	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	72	653	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	2.5458879751427843	2.5068474056838426	low	low	An essay written by a 57.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 135000.0$.

It brings out the selfishness of humans and their inability to share this wonderful world with its other inhabitants. These animals should be properly cared for, and perhaps some of the financing could come from fines imposed upon the people who illegally absconded with them in the first place.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	64.0	27000.0	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	75	852	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0	2.816559210068297	2.821990804475546	low	low	An essay written by a 64.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000.0$.

Despite our technological advances we fall prey to the same prejudices and biases again and again. Before we were burning Native Americans, then the Irish, then Blacks, and now Muslims. Human progress at work.	anger	1.0	2.0	3.0	23.0	25000.0	5.5	6.5	1.0	1.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	2.857	3.143	1.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	80	640	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	2.549603503353121	2.4702219194232558	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old black or african american male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000.0$.

I bet some of them will latch onto the El Nino contribution to ""prove"" that it's just the randomness of nature.  However, they will fail to understand that it's only a random amplification of the effects that we a directly responsible for by spewing so much CO2 in to the atmosphere.

It's strange to me that we treat human life as if it is less than important.   I wish that people would wake up from the old-world ideals and behavior.  Thanks to the 20th century and the advent of film as a story-telling mechanic, we have the ability to be able to share stories with each other on a bigger level.  I can't believe that it's 2018 and we still operate as if it's 1400 a.d.   I am disgusted by our modern culture and our governmental system.  It's all a sham.

It breaks my heart these people are subject to being afraid of such violence and brutality. The women that were raped and especially by there government is nonesense and cant believe in 2019 this is still happening. They need to create a more civilized society over there. Even aid workers who are just there to help were brutally raped that tells me these people have no consequences for actions and to consious of human suffering.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

I find that how America feels about it, and others around the world, is more correct, than in error. Whereby they are appalled by all the violence and blood shed. I feel personally that each party should consider the welfare of the people at large, than any self-aggrandizements, and personal power plays.

Attacks of terror and mass shooting are mostly causes by angry white men. When It's a white man hes a lone wolf and when your from a foreign country its terrorism.

In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	105	85	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0526315789473684	3.168803304379618	2.9649278441356337	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

Do you think she really has a say though or will they just force her to step down if she does not volunteer.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	42000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	3.143	2.857	3.714	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	61	198	0.2	0.2	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.804668195272072	2.7617726991503746	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

I also personally dont like Trump, as I find him to be a rather bombastic idiot, and wish Hillary wuold have won, though I didn't particularly want either of them. I hope he takes the stress of the election into becoming a better leader.	joy	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	67	169	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.2727272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1666666666666666	2.460583154687998	2.3541272116557392	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

2.5	4.125	I tend to be very hard-hearted when it comes to issues of immigration. Yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an American, raised here from the age of three and facing deportation for missed paperwork? This is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit. There are those who come here, infest neighborhoods and take away jobs from hard working Americans and then there are victims of bureaucratic anarcho-tyranny like this. These types of scenarios are unacceptable.  I tend to believe that a system that will let the guilty go free is preferable to one that will punish even one innocent man.

Day two was no different, nor the days following. Since Election Day, there have been more than 200 acts of election-related intimidation and harassment across the U.S., according to a survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center. People from all types of communities ― black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, Asian, queer people, women ― have been physically harmed, slandered with hate speech or been the targets of racist graffiti.

The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.

6.0	2.125	I recently came across an article that was both captivating and profoundly melancholic. It featured a woman who lived in the UK and held the remarkable position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What struck me was the astonishing fact that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It is truly remarkable to envision running an entire magazine at such an early stage in life. However, her existence was plagued by a lifelong struggle with depression, which she openly addressed in a book. Battling her mental health issues, she sought help and was admitted to a mental hospital. Tragically, despite being cleared by the hospital, she chose to walk into the ocean and met a heartbreaking fate. The lack of adequate assistance she received is truly saddening. I sincerely hope that all our friends know that we are here for them, providing unwavering support no matter what challenges they may be confronting.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	158	2235	0.0816326530612244	0.0204081632653061	0.1020408163265306	0.1632653061224489	0.0816326530612244	0.2244897959183673	0.1020408163265306	0.1020408163265306	0.0	0.1224489795918367	0.0303030303030303	2.976623179569859	2.817444701762269	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

Apparently, the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below. Everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible tragedy it was. I feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again. You're suppose to have fun at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting hurt when you get on these rides. Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	63000.0	6.5	4.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.143	1.0	2.571	4.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	124	510	0.1944444444444444	0.1388888888888889	0.0277777777777777	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0434782608695652	3.076003552971601	2.9289884995829376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000.0$.

The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it.

2.5	3.25	"So I just had to read this article for a survey. It was completely unformatted, an enormous text-wall essay list. I made it all the way through though. I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot. I think that's kinda weird that something like that was even included in an article with feminist tone."	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	27.0	15000.0	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	139	897	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.4117647058823529	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0357142857142857	2.482067050265856	2.2223396177554178	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	108	541	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

I think a lot of military casualties are extremely sad, but it seems especially bad when it is not even in combat and just in a situation like this that should have been harmless.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	83	1760	0.2352941176470588	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2941176470588235	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.853126984786253	2.820481391574877	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

The part of this article that really got to me was that the Muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely.  It would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions.  It would be awful to have the prices of food go up because of blockades and other reasons.  It would be stressful and scary.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	6000.0	7.0	3.0	1.0	7.0	3.5	3.143	4.2860000000000005	4.0	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	87	615	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.748012926016522	2.7368525342602377	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 6000.0$.

1.0	1.0	It doesn't matter what country you live in. The powerful will always stomp on the weak. Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

2.5	5.875	I just read this crazy article about Wells Fargo that I thought I would share with you. It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	144	619	0.0377358490566037	0.0943396226415094	0.1509433962264151	0.2075471698113207	0.0943396226415094	0.1698113207547169	0.0566037735849056	0.0566037735849056	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.064516129032258	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

There's been no apology, only a doubling down on the kind of bile, arrogance, and ignorance that was on display since day one. I feel bad for every woman in the country who has to live with someone like that as their president."	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	12000.0	5.5	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	74	83	0.0434782608695652	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.2608695652173913	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0869565217391304	0.0	2.53019083124816	2.544220419033075	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000.0$.

I just finished reading an article about an endangered species in the Gulf called the Vaquita that is slated to be extinct by 2022 due to nothing beyond happening to be in the water where people are fishing. It's just so thoughtless, so shortsighted, and so frustratingly preventable.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	39.0	48000.0	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	78	762	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	3.015850640402328	2.945623628021184	low	medium	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000.0$.

IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	83	74	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	3.0713105871652693	2.773428339776415	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Imagine the horror of being trapped in a tiny well for hours and hours until finally you die.  I imagine you would dehydrate and it would be extremely painful and scary.  It's sad that no one got to him in time.  I am also heartbroken for the family, how terrible.  I'm sure this is the kind of thing no one ever expects to happen.

I think people are not willing to accept that others are really shitty and that someone like Trump would be voted in. They can't see past others. People have too much faith in others, too much trust. There are a lot of vile people out there, just gotta encourage them a little bit and they'll come out. Trump was their encouragement. What will the liberals do now? I don't know. Sometimes I think we will be okay, sometimes I think we won't. I just know that going to one march is going to do shit. You need tens of marches, packed to the brim. You need them every weekend.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them.

If we can't fix the issues here in America, how can we critizice other countries?	surprise	2.0	5.0	2.0	41.0	60000.0	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	78	40	0.25	0.0	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.662395532568908	2.469137934827045	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

This river was a main source of life for everyone and it has been ruined forever. I feel for the guy who said it feels like he lost a family memeber a life lost because its been a source of life for so many for so long. It is very unfair that the clean up is so slow going and that they are taking so long to fix there wrong. I also feel bad for the fish who died because mud was stuc in there gills its such a slow painful death. I would never drink or eat from that river again as who knows how that can effect people and if itll ever really be clean.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	145	1693	0.0961538461538461	0.1153846153846153	0.0576923076923076	0.0769230769230769	0.0192307692307692	0.0961538461538461	0.2115384615384615	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0576923076923076	0.0	3.1027733461334823	2.858414450114356	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.0	3.25	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

He was a special wolf from a pack in California that was endangered and had a tracking device on him so they could monitor his movements. he had already traveled 700 miles looking for a mate, which is what wolves do when they come of age. They are trying to hold them accountable for the needless and cruel slaughter of wild animals. I forgot the name of the group. But I hope they stop them. Animals need more laws that protect them from evil garbage people.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	58.0	20000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	3.143	3.429	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	105	1008	0.1463414634146341	0.0975609756097561	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0975609756097561	0.1219512195121951	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.0555555555555555	3.0135964648506186	2.848950326566398	medium	medium	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

I did not get too many details about all of the evidence that they have against her but to me at least it does not seem like they have that much evidence. I guess she ordered her friend a coffee before her friend got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died. Pretty crazy, right? I think she probably did it but their motive is weak and I do not think that she would have been found guilty if the trial was going on in the US.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	124	620	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.1818181818181818	0.1515151515151515	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.797317659848697	2.7629927272499057	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here.

Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

Only so many resources in this country and unless we want to become another 3rd world country we have to send them home. Make them wait in line just like any other legal immigrant. Why should they be given special privileges to be in this country.

Gilbert and Wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason (birthday, anniversary, or promotion etc.) and how long they thought that feeling would last. People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	128	185	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.064516129032258	2.976505059449956	2.831572665407568	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	142	1796	0.131578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0263157894736842	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.922928181610742	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go.

She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	130	1594	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.25	0.05	0.05	0.0588235294117647	2.921270175908798	2.719409547178719	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

They did it for money. If you are a parent struggling for money, how in the world does your mind turn to sexually abusing your child for money? They are sick, and 20 years is not enough time for them in prison. They are the people that are supposed to protect her, and they violated her in the worst way. She is very brave for telling her story and for just being a survivor.	disgust	2.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	25000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.571	4.2860000000000005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	105	678	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.0256410256410256	0.1282051282051282	0.0	3.096453479940636	3.0635524369202405	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.0	6.0	President Donald Trumps actions during his election and so far during the presidency has been nothing short of childish.  I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.

3.5	5.5	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	143	1590	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0416666666666666	2.940207057128023	2.766534416358188	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

1.0	1.0	I read an article about Typhoon Meranti. The article said the storm passed by Taiwan without actually hitting the island, which I suppose was a good thing, because evidently there was another storm in 2009, Typhone Morakot, that killed a bunch of people and did billions of dollars of damage. I'm glad I don't live somewhere where there's any inclement weather like that, it must be miserable to live on an island where it's hot and crowded.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	77	53	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1333333333333333	2.376774620047966	2.227403531246315	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.167	1.625	I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

1.5	1.875	I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday. A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons.

I think I care more about myself now:  My health, I stand up for myself when appropriate, I feel like there are more possibilities out there now without my smoking monkey on my back.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	36.0	20000.0	4.5	5.5	1.0	5.0	6.0	3.429	2.0	2.714	3.143	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	86	390	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.4545454545454545	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.606628080188372	2.545323111737039	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

2.0	2.5	If you hear a ringing in your occasionally, don't be too alarmed. If you hear it persistently for quite some time, I would be slightly worried and definitely more alarmed. This could mean that you eventually lose your hearing. Tinnitus is a common thing to experience and usually is nothing. But sometimes this can be an early sign that you could lose your hearing. I strongly encourage people to go and get this checked if they experience frequently and definitely educate yourself on it.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	84	914	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.925540185694296	2.7364630801939853	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

It's a good thing that most only had minor injuries and there weren't any deaths though. I think that something like this is terrible because it is an accident of one person that can really hurt others as well. Hopefully people are more careful in the future.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	1702	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0833333333333333	2.712178415326699	2.5283778216311563	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

It just sounds completely horrific and with such a terrible ending too.  It would have been much different if they had been able to rescue him but clearly that was not possible.

It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	44000.0	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	155	535	0.0	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.0434782608695652	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830317	medium	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I empathize deeply with the victims and their families. They were simply carrying out their duties when this unfortunate explosion, resulting from negligence, tragically claimed their lives. It is disheartening that despite being aware of the hazardous and insecure working conditions, no action has been taken to shut down these facilities. While I appreciate the closure of approximately 1,000 establishments, I believe more needs to be accomplished. It is crucial to establish a governing body and implement regulations similar to OSHA in the US, ensuring the protection of workers and the implementation of all necessary precautions to safeguard human life. Currently, families are left bereft of their beloved sons, fathers, and sources of income, when a simple closure could have prevented this loss. I fervently hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	133	2206	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0408163265306122	0.2244897959183673	0.1836734693877551	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1020408163265306	0.0357142857142857	3.0012886178493576	2.916732470700339	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

3.167	3.25	Not a surprise to see the United States falling further down in the global rankings in yet another category. I think by the time our next Presidential election comes around we will be no longer be considered a destination country but anyone in the know. I don't see why this particular stat isn't a matter of culture though. I haven't met many women who expressed an interest in STEM and most of them didn't even want to talk to people who were into it when I was in college. Now women might be more interested but it still isn't going to be anything approaching equal because the culture doesn't work that way.	neutral	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	112	418	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0	2.4433770194131217	2.38452346108504	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I feel so bad for their families.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	65	1766	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.827013630213747	2.658298490501681	low	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely.

Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway.

I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously.

These senseless acts are obviously those of cowards that have no regard for human life and should be captured and dealt with harshly.  There is not enough room in this world for people that would do this to others for any cause or religion.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	130	2093	0.0	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.4210526315789473	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.1578947368421052	0.0434782608695652	2.9105654631253968	2.8291657661711667	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

It's crazy what this world has come to people just killing people all the time and usually for no reason. It's crazy and people need to be punished harsher.

6.5	6.875	This article about post-traumatic stress disorder is disturbing on many levels. This country really doesn't take care of our veterans. Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	529	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.0416666666666666	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

They also cant afford to send them lunch and the government isnt stepping in to help which would be a good investment as they are the future of there society.Someone needs to step in send aid as teachers can only do so much they need to demand others to help out.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life.

2.5	1.0	Wow, how sad.  So many people dead for no reason.  This sounds just like a terrible accident to me, I mean they think it could have been caused by lightning striking?  What are the odds?  It's so sad when things like this happen that result in such a massive loss of life.  I feel bad for all the families affected and plus of course all the victims who lost their lives due to something so unnecessary.  Sometimes things like this just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it I guess.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	93	1752	0.1724137931034483	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.1724137931034483	0.1724137931034483	0.0689655172413793	0.0	0.0	2.823700867052452	2.717904469750892	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

4.333	4.125	What this article taught me was that heartbreaks are not the end of the world. Yes, they are NOT. Just because that one precious person left us we start living with an emotion that our life has come to an end. Life isn't ending at all, each day is a new beginning, with new people waiting for us out there. As you move forward, life will remove many people from your life just because they aren't required and you can actually reach your destination. Your life has just begun, nobody stops moving, the sun still rises and the sun still sets.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	28.0	78097.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.5	3.714	3.286	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	101	981	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2142857142857142	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.1785714285714285	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0416666666666666	2.9607182020337874	2.916355490838252	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 78097.0$.

I mean I know you're a big gold fan, so I understand how this is upsetting you. I will send you more articles about him later on today so we can talk more about him. What do you think? Who do you think was better? Jack or Arnold? What about tiger? Either way, I hope you get this article and it helps lift your spirits a bit.

Due to drops in oil prices, and the loss of income the country has received from this drop, the citizens are the ones that are paying for it.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.

3.667	5.875	The article was quite eye opening for someone who may not be extremely into politics.  The confederate flag seems to somehow have different meanings to different people, which I never really understood.  To get upset because the flag was being hung in college campuses, makes sense to me.  I would get upset as well.  For students to be afraid for their welfare and or they education at their college because of President elect Trump, also makes sense to me.

It's also sad how the police officers ran away which was I guess the main point of the person telling the story. That is very corrupt and wrong, they should have stood up for the Rangers being targeted. I think it's best if the wildlife is preserved and the community that attacked the Rangers were clearly out of line.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	80	480	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.706523654784907	2.598670371424574	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.

Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.

I just read and article about it, and for law enforcement to keep enough information and follow enough leads to prevent every attack, we would need to sacrifice a lot of our civil liberties. It is just not worth it.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	27.0	20000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	3.0	3.0	3.714	3.0	2.857	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	71	242	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	3.037747788207557	2.779411938947004	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

1.167	1.0	I just read an article about America's refugee problem, that talked about the Somali community in Minneapolis. I can't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article; it just makes me sick to see any reporting that doesn't only concern the facts, with no editorializing by the author. I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	sadness	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	73	50	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.3571428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.570467739636896	2.441225217124561	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I feel immense sympathy for the victims and their families. They were merely fulfilling their job responsibilities when this unfortunate explosion, caused by sheer carelessness, resulted in the loss of their lives. It is truly tragic that the awareness of the life-threatening and unsafe working conditions did not prompt immediate closure. Although I am glad that around 1,000 establishments are scheduled for closure, I strongly believe that more comprehensive measures are required. The formation of a council and the implementation of regulations, similar to the US's OSHA, should be prioritized to safeguard workers and ensure the strict adherence to safety measures for the preservation of human life. As a consequence of the failure to act promptly, families are now left without their sons, fathers, and a source of income that could have been easily avoided. I earnestly hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	145	2207	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.125	0.0357142857142857	0.0892857142857142	0.054054054054054	2.9157967974667645	2.795032757138069	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It sounds like a severe case of pneumonia, but from what, how and why.  And the fluid on the brain of the one sister is so strange.  I would think they would know more after the autopsies, and I don't understand why that is taking so long.  I'm thinking that the family wants to bring the bodies back to the States and that could be holding up the autopsies.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	60000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	1.714	2.4290000000000003	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	105	493	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.786801374507373	2.64032793888475	low	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

5.0	5.0	This article truly grounds us and reminds us of the complexity of the world we inhabit. It underscores the fallibility of scientific knowledge and the vast expanse of yet-to-be-discovered information. The realization that these animals, previously free from the disease, have now become carriers, raises concerns about genetic mutations and the potential for widespread transmission. The profound sadness lies in the suffering endured by these innocent creatures, with no relief in sight. My fervent hope is that extensive research will be conducted to halt the disease's spread before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I express gratitude towards the conservationist who raised awareness and encouraged others to share their concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	113	2231	0.0789473684210526	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.131578947368421	0.0263157894736842	0.2631578947368421	0.131578947368421	0.1052631578947368	0.0789473684210526	0.0789473684210526	0.0357142857142857	2.9639081444271405	2.78119214424294	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

This is just crazy to me and I hope that it never actually happens and that the people who live there can fight it. It just seems to me that this is just another case of government over reach. These politicians are probably going to benefit financially somehow from this deal . It is the only explanation that makes any sense to me. Why else would you destroy a whole community?	anger	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	91	622	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	2.7802581244768207	2.7415234609295527	low	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

4.167	3.5	Thomas referred the case to the full court, and shortly before midnight, the justices issued an order granting Arthur’s stay request. The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

The man has lowered the bar so far and affected our country so negatively for years to come due to his voracious appetite for appointing judges. I sincerely hope that more people will pay attention to the corruption and need for a radical restructuring of American politics due to his administration.	hope	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	66	2098	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0625	2.609287298605506	2.4478172117701926	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

It said this happened at 6:30pm so I wonder if maybe the sun was shining right in someone's eyes because that has happened to me at sunset and I could barely see. It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	23.0	27000.0	5.0	5.5	1.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	2.714	3.429	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	484	0.1538461538461538	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.811145798313764	2.7370854918760794	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 27000.0$.

4.167	4.0	Dude, you won't believe this. A six-year-old girl fell down an elevator shaft and died. The elevator company has to be at fault here, but that won't bring her back! I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

It's obvious that women there are treated like second rate citizens and do not have many liberties, so anything that can be done to fix this is a positive thing I believe.  This is 2019 and there's no reason why a woman should need a male escort to do anything.  That sounds ridiculous to me as an American woman.  I feel sad for the women living in these nations.

1.5	1.5	All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

I think this story really made me think about that and brought fourth some really interesting facts and data that make you see how it is changing and hurting different parts of the world.

They were simply performing their job duties when this reckless explosion, which could have been prevented, tragically snatched away their lives. It is disheartening to know that despite being aware of the lethal and unsafe working conditions, the authorities have yet to take the necessary steps to shut down such operations. While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life. At present, families are left without their sons, fathers, and sources of income, all of which could have been avoided through a simple shutdown. I fervently hope for enhanced working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	148	2208	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.175438596491228	0.0526315789473684	0.2456140350877192	0.1403508771929824	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.032258064516129	2.938415829895253	2.8967542206162515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""

6.0	5.625	Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

5.0	5.0	This article serves as a humbling reminder of our place in the world. It sheds light on the fallibility of scientific understanding and the vast realm of knowledge that remains beyond our grasp. The discovery that these animals, previously unaffected by the disease, now carry it raises alarming questions about potential genetic mutations and the subsequent spread of the ailment. The sorrowful reality is that these small creatures endure immense pain without any means of alleviating it. I earnestly hope that extensive research will be conducted to find ways to curtail the disease's transmission before it leads to the extinction of the entire species.

Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help?

According to the most current statistics, over fifteen million Americans can be classified as extremely obese.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	45.0	40000.0	6.0	4.0	2.5	5.5	6.0	2.143	1.857	3.0	2.4290000000000003	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	62	409	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0	0.0	2.794760288339753	2.9046400157458008	medium	medium	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 40000.0$.

It is about the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and they discuss how smoking should be banned in all parks, zoos, and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal. I can see why some might say that this is the last step before criminalization of the product and consumer.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	24.0	35000.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.857	3.714	3.286	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	77	778	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	2.6668819573770866	2.6775758917762564	medium	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This article is incredibly distressing. Reading about the struggles endured by individuals in other parts of the world is profoundly disheartening. It is unfathomable to think that people would forsake their parents and elderly family members during times of war. To compound matters, their homes lack sufficient food, leaving them in a dire situation. They face constant attacks and are deprived of basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My sincerest hope is for an end to these wars, allowing these people to receive the assistance needed to rebuild their lives and homes. Donating to charities dedicated to helping these regions requires heightened efforts. While I understand the hesitation some may feel about traveling and living there, given the high likelihood of death from airstrikes, it is imperative that these individuals at least have access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	145	2222	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.048780487804878	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.1951219512195122	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.073170731707317	0.0344827586206896	3.1115116042551176	2.900474509340724	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

And let's face it America's hands aren't clean in the middle east, or Africa. America has learned nothing from past wars. We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	joy	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	30	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935160266587608	2.799303973765628	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I hope Keith can make his plan come alive and stop the invasion of the mice. My concern is if they start getting off the island and migrating to other places. I live far away in America, but I sure don't want to run across these giant bird-eating mice.

I'm very happy to live in this beautiful country and I wish people would stop complaining so much about everything they think is wrong here.  Just be grateful you're not being used as a human shield.  Some of the things going on over there are just atrocious, and as bad as people think it is here it doesn't even hold a candle to that.

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

Mr. Issa has been motivated by fear of political repercussions more than his constituents’ best interests.

Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	99	36	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.901869276182453	2.975700762759283	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

His docs state both he and Kate have waived any right to spousal support, and that suggests there's a prenup. They were married in 2004 and have no kids together. TMZ broke the story ... the couple's marriage was on the rocks last November.

Researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities in the US estimated there were more than 90,000 early deaths in Indonesia in areas closest to haze-belching fires, and several thousand more in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia.

6.0	6.0	I harbor profound sadness for the victims and the victims' families. They were simply performing their job duties when this reckless explosion, which could have been prevented, tragically snatched away their lives. It is disheartening to know that despite being aware of the lethal and unsafe working conditions, the authorities have yet to take the necessary steps to shut down such operations. While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life. At present, families are left without their sons, fathers, and sources of income, all of which could have been avoided through a simple shutdown. I fervently hope for enhanced working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	148	2208	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.175438596491228	0.0526315789473684	0.2456140350877192	0.1403508771929824	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.032258064516129	2.938415829895253	2.8967542206162515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.5	3.5	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	disgust/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	128	2042	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.1724137931034483	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0909090909090909	2.611000319206454	2.4650590113548265	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.

5.0	3.375	So apparently there is an infamous retired nba star who is going around and pieing influential political figures haha. At first I thought it was a typo, and it was suppose to be die, but it indeed was talking about someone taking a coconut pie, and slamming it into the face of people. The act seems pretty innocent to me, and is almost sad that he is going to have to face some jail time along with the beating from the security. Obviously, you cant go around doing this, but it is tough not to laugh.	sadness	1.0	6.0	6.0	23.0	55000.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.0	1.857	3.571	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	96	403	0.1212121212121212	0.0606060606060606	0.1212121212121212	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.1515151515151515	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.125	2.8230728267538168	2.7308606763124144	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This article is truly heart-wrenching. It is challenging to come to terms with the plight of individuals in different parts of the world. The fact that people would abandon their parents and elderly relatives during times of war is beyond comprehension. Additionally, the scarcity of food in their homes exacerbates the situation. They constantly face attacks and lack access to basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My earnest desire is for the cessation of wars and for these individuals to receive the necessary assistance to rebuild their lives and homes. It is crucial to prioritize greater efforts in donating to charities that aid these regions. While I can understand why some would be hesitant to travel and reside there, given the high risk of death from airstrikes, the least these people should have is access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	146	2221	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.119047619047619	0.0238095238095238	0.2142857142857142	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	3.109474679825728	2.8650273029390023	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

From talking to them I know they know that mistakes have been made in terms of their animal facilities and on-going care.” China’s	joy	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	140	179	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.119047619047619	0.119047619047619	0.0714285714285714	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0238095238095238	0.119047619047619	0.1034482758620689	2.875097045143344	2.8182714715372934	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned.

I wish there was something more we were doing to stop climate change and these warm temps!	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	60000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	6.0	5.0	3.429	3.143	2.714	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	69	360	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.9675941630866665	2.742948742141914	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

1.167	1.125	So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

For the most part, little assistance reaches a person fleeing a conflict until he or she crosses an international border. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, distinguishes refugees and IDPs this way: ""When a fleeing civilian crosses an international frontier, he or she becomes a refugee and as such is eligible to receive international protection and help. If a person in similar circumstances is displaced within his or her home country and becomes an internally displaced person, then assistance and protection"	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	4000.0	6.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	3.286	3.286	3.857	2.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	121	426	0.2142857142857142	0.1785714285714285	0.0	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.0	0.0357142857142857	0.0	3.1685396313674024	2.856296202525571	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 4000.0$.

7.0	1.5	I am writing to you regarding the floods in Louisiana, and all the displaced residents. I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

While the reef is mostly destroyed, it has sections that are coming back to life, and it can be stimulated back to recovery despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death stroke. Did you know it can be seen from outer space? How magnificent! We should do what we can to preserve it, even if it is a losing cause because it is a true wonder of nature.

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too. Somehow we have to figure out better relief efforts for natural disasters.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	62.0	5500.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	105	925	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.2258064516129032	0.064516129032258	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.9639654974634384	2.622677973711621	medium	low	An essay written by a 62.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 5500.0$.

Upon reading an article on the recent developments in Germany, a country that was previously celebrated for its support of immigrants, it becomes apparent that the situation has become more arduous. This fills me with remorse and a deep sense of pain for those who genuinely require a place of refuge, something that Germany was well-known for providing in the past. Hopefully, there will be a reversal of these circumstances.	hope/sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	150000.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.286	3.857	3.0	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	90	2202	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0555555555555555	2.890804998220996	2.5956197897737803	low	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

They want to roll back regulations when things like this happened because there were none and now kids have to pay the price, but they are kids of color so they dont matter.

Its time to get these people out of office and to punish the companies and people that have allowed this to happened to the innocent children of America.

The area doesn't get water year round so they have to find ways to save water for the dry months. The dry area is between Argentina and Paraguay and currently Argentina has figured out ways to make the water last for them and is essentially taking the water and leaving the other side dry.

Perhaps it's because I can't imagine harming myself that I don't understand the state that this people must be in. Suicide is such a tough situation and so hard to deal with. It makes me sad to think people target troubled souls and enjoy seeing the harm they do to themselves.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	22000.0	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	87	1730	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0833333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.868074302673593	2.763227152971426	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000.0$.

So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

6.5	2.875	The plight of the mother and her two daughters, who perished in the accident, fills me with deep sorrow. Being someone who is prone to worrying, the mere thought of being in a trailer intensifies my concerns. It is an incredibly tragic circumstance that their lives were tragically cut short as they sought to create joyful memories and embark on a Halloween adventure. I earnestly hope that the other individuals involved in the collision can eventually discover inner peace.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	79	2204	0.0888888888888888	0.0222222222222222	0.1555555555555555	0.0888888888888888	0.0444444444444444	0.1555555555555555	0.1777777777777777	0.1333333333333333	0.0222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0588235294117647	2.976858725746328	2.839297914798831	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?  Anyway, this is sad news although life does go on and it is the way of the world I guess.	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	93	1793	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0555555555555555	0.0714285714285714	3.1599866108917123	2.9280750923268544	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

3.833	4.375	I feel that it is a common thing to have intentions misplaced. The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

3.5	5.5	The article is profoundly heartbreaking. It is truly difficult to read about the plight of people in other parts of the world. The fact that some individuals would abandon their parents and elderly family members amidst the chaos of war is beyond comprehension. To make matters worse, their homes are devoid of sufficient food supplies, leaving them in a state of extreme vulnerability. They face incessant attacks and are unable to obtain even basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My utmost hope is for the cessation of these wars and for these people to receive the necessary assistance in rebuilding their lives and homes. It is vital to dedicate more effort to donating to charities that actively support these areas. While I understand the reluctance of some to travel and reside there, considering the high probability of death from airstrikes, it is essential that these individuals, at the very least, have access to fundamental necessities such as food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	166	2223	0.1509433962264151	0.0377358490566037	0.0754716981132075	0.0943396226415094	0.0377358490566037	0.1886792452830188	0.1886792452830188	0.1320754716981132	0.0377358490566037	0.0566037735849056	0.024390243902439	3.025683770249182	2.842196325336194	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently read a captivating yet deeply sorrowful article. It centered around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed role of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What astounded me was that she assumed this significant responsibility at the tender age of thirty. The remarkable feat of running an entire magazine at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring. However, her life was marred by a lifelong battle with depression, which she bravely chronicled in a book. Despite seeking help and being admitted to a mental hospital, she tragically chose to end her life by walking into the ocean. The fact that she did not receive the essential support she needed is truly devastating. I earnestly hope that all our friends are aware of our unwavering presence and support, no matter the challenges they may be facing.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	142	2234	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.1666666666666666	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0238095238095238	0.119047619047619	0.0666666666666666	2.87685812876358	2.729225671010066	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

Just having a shocking video that raises awareness doesn't help the problem from starting, just helps us react to it quicker.  We need to keep building programs that are designed to support our children, but we need to do it before they start to bully (or be bullied).  So many of our anti-bullying stories talk about standing up to them and bullying back...that is not the way!	anger	2.0	7.0	1.0	35.0	80000.0	7.0	5.5	3.5	7.0	5.5	4.0	1.857	3.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	86	386	0.2352941176470588	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.9571737496092334	2.9271423921088875	medium	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000.0$.

I hope after this political race is over, we can all reflect and learn to treat each other better.	neutral	1.0	5.0	4.0	40.0	70000.0	5.5	5.5	2.0	6.5	5.5	3.857	1.857	2.714	3.286	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	77	1069	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.1875	3.055143026563649	2.8546965621862705	medium	low	An essay written by a 40.0 years old native american or american indian male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

It is sad that they know how deadly and unsafe these worker conditions are but still have yet to close them. I am happy they are set to close around 1,000 but i think more has to be done.

1.0	1.625	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation. It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	136	281	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

That is so unnatural and just wrong really.  and all this has happened in just a short period of time!	sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	88	1820	0.1111111111111111	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.0	2.9353729782563014	2.890112796868368	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

1.6669999999999998	3.875	I really feel bad for Turkey. I think they are trying to do everything they can to get rid of terrorism in the country. It seems that their efforts are for naught. They want to keep the people safe and yet more terrorist groups keep popping up. Then the lawmakers are involved and there is only so much you can do. Turkey is constantly at war. I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here. It is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want peace. There is always terrorism and someone trying to bring down a country, but the country tries its hardest to fight back despite opposition.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	82000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	4.714	3.286	4.2860000000000005	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	129	534	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.0555555555555555	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	2.7844872062063515	2.7601166472237884	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 82000.0$.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

He traveled through rough conditions like a jill field and stillended up dying. I think thes eprograms by the government to kill animals is horrifying. We should all live together in hamony. If they are a pest we should find ways that dont harm them like relocating the animals to help the problem not kill innocent souls.Someday they will find a solution that wont harm lives and live in peace.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	97	1868	0.2368421052631578	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.2368421052631578	0.131578947368421	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.0	3.0188541768942163	2.8638008886888198	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.0	1.125	I read about this asshole Arcan Cetin who shot up a mall in Oak Harbor, Washington. Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I empathize deeply with the victims and their families. They were simply carrying out their duties when this unfortunate explosion, resulting from negligence, tragically claimed their lives. It is disheartening that despite being aware of the hazardous and insecure working conditions, no action has been taken to shut down these facilities. While I appreciate the closure of approximately 1,000 establishments, I believe more needs to be accomplished. It is crucial to establish a governing body and implement regulations similar to OSHA in the US, ensuring the protection of workers and the implementation of all necessary precautions to safeguard human life. Currently, families are left bereft of their beloved sons, fathers, and sources of income, when a simple closure could have prevented this loss. I fervently hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	133	2206	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0408163265306122	0.2244897959183673	0.1836734693877551	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1020408163265306	0.0357142857142857	3.0012886178493576	2.916732470700339	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	120	603	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive.

4.0	7.0	If it's not bad enough that the father is a child molester who molested his own child, the mother had the nerve to join in on the abuse. I doubt very serious if she was forced to do it as she could have divorced him or left him rather commit such a heinous crime and money is no excuse. I wouldn't molest my child for all the money in the world. These people were just sicking perverse sorry excuses for human beings.	anger	2.0	2.0	3.0	39.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	7.0	7.0	4.857	2.143	4.857	4.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	82	875	0.0925925925925925	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0925925925925925	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1666666666666666	0.074074074074074	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.699757073904681	3.011887977694082	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old black or african american female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 29000.0$.

The family was well known but that does not keep them safe from the depression or despair that can hit anyone at any time. You should look out for one another. It is a very tough world out there.

Some people get more, and some people get along well with less, but everyone needs to get enough sleep or else they cannot function effectively in their everyday activities. In their work, Your Guide to a Healthy Sleep, National Institutes of Health pointed out that sleep is very important to human existence, so important that one-third of a person’s life is spent doing it (1). In Sleep, Sleep Disorders, and Biological Rhythms, Amlaner said, “Sleep is a required activity, not an option” (19). During sleep the human body has an opportunity to recuperate from the activities of the day.

I can see myself looking back to be sure that he is still with me, maybe reaching back to try to pull him closer. It is a very intense thought.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	36.0	96000.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	4.5	5.5	3.429	2.571	3.286	3.857	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	505	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	3.01414493870761	2.847752128184612	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 96000.0$.

6.0	6.625	I always feel bad when women talk about their experiences with sexual assault because you know how I feel about that but I want to put it into words anyway. I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

Some may think they are doing good things trying to get people to a better place, but these traffickers do not see people and are wanting to help them.  They see them as money, they take advantage of them and take every single thing they can from them while promising them a better life.  They do not care about the safety of people and are just trying to maximize their profits.  The only reason they wouldn't just get rid of the migrants out at sea after taking all their belongings is it may be bad for business.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	110	601	0.04	0.12	0.08	0.08	0.08	0.24	0.12	0.08	0.08	0.08	0.0526315789473684	2.9061901776385435	2.898203970660226	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

It is unfortunate that the people can't protect their own area, but they are probably poor, and consider the money necessary.	sadness	1.0	5.0	1.0	31.0	82000.0	3.5	2.5	2.0	4.5	5.0	3.571	2.286	1.857	2.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	62	1830	0.0625	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.830279662213032	2.6658718706820417	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 82000.0$.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

It's just really sad that such an innocent animal died because of this accident.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	74	1781	0.1875	0.0625	0.03125	0.15625	0.0625	0.1875	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.789914393546512	2.728038332315472	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000.0$.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true.

This town needs some better traffic laws and maybe drivers licensure tests. It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt.

3.667	4.625	This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

Where are the parents when the kids are out there fighting and attacking people in the street. Its just disgusting. I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	97	156	0.1666666666666666	0.1944444444444444	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0666666666666666	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.
