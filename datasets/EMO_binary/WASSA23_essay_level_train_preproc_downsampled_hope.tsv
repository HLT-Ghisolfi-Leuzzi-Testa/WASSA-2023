6.0	6.0	There were numerous aspects of this article that deeply troubled me. I cannot fathom experiencing what this girl went through because I would never expect my parents to subject me to such circumstances. It's astonishing that they have been released from jail, as they appear to pose a significant threat to society by perpetrating such acts against their own child. It is my fervent hope that these individuals never come into contact with another innocent child. As parents, our primary duty is to safeguard our children, and this girl can never reclaim her lost childhood. It is difficult to comprehend how she could ever trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such trauma. Her mental state must be profoundly affected, and I genuinely wish for her to receive the necessary support.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	133	2254	0.081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.1081081081081081	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.2972972972972973	0.1351351351351351	0.054054054054054	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0384615384615384	3.1123587064547973	3.09501349531376	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country. I can see being so desperate in a third world country that this would seem like the police are cutting off or taking your only source of livlihood. These poor guys however they are just trying to protect and do what is right they do not deserve to be so violently attacked im suprised they were able to live through such a brutal beating.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	joy	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	30	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935160266587608	2.799303973765628	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The police and the local population are both attempting to protect the sacred wildlife and its creatures, while the village likely requires the animal's meat or the funds from its sale, given their extreme poverty.

These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely striving to safeguard and do what is morally right. They don't deserve to be subjected to such a violent attack, and I'm surprised they managed to survive such a brutal beating. I hope that more actions are taken to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	124	2241	0.18	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.06	0.2	0.14	0.08	0.04	0.02	0.08	2.9351966297555325	2.836919471871327	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently read a captivating yet deeply sorrowful article. It centered around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed role of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What astounded me was that she assumed this significant responsibility at the tender age of thirty. The remarkable feat of running an entire magazine at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring. However, her life was marred by a lifelong battle with depression, which she bravely chronicled in a book. Despite seeking help and being admitted to a mental hospital, she tragically chose to end her life by walking into the ocean. The fact that she did not receive the essential support she needed is truly devastating. I earnestly hope that all our friends are aware of our unwavering presence and support, no matter the challenges they may be facing.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	142	2234	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.1666666666666666	0.0952380952380952	0.238095238095238	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0238095238095238	0.119047619047619	0.0666666666666666	2.87685812876358	2.729225671010066	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This type of article deeply resonates with me. It underscores the urgent need to protect and closely monitor older individuals, as these incidents occur far too frequently. Numerous seniors suffer from dementia, rendering them unaware of their surroundings and highly prone to becoming lost. Contemplating the possibility of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sadness. The image of them wandering, without a coat, feeling cold and frightened, is absolutely heart-wrenching. I am immensely grateful that the officers located her before any harm befell her. My hope is that she can be promptly reunited with her family, and that comprehensive safeguards are implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring. It may be beneficial for the family to consider additional support options, such as a group home, to ensure her well-being and provide the necessary assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	140	2247	0.1333333333333333	0.0222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.1777777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0222222222222222	0.0444444444444444	0.0769230769230769	2.963389717656195	2.8083628941152767	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

They were simply performing their job duties when this reckless explosion, which could have been prevented, tragically snatched away their lives. It is disheartening to know that despite being aware of the lethal and unsafe working conditions, the authorities have yet to take the necessary steps to shut down such operations. While I find solace in the fact that approximately 1,000 establishments are slated for closure, I strongly believe that more extensive actions are imperative. A council and regulatory framework, akin to the US's OSHA, should be established to safeguard workers and ensure the strict implementation of safety precautions to preserve human life. At present, families are left without their sons, fathers, and sources of income, all of which could have been avoided through a simple shutdown. I fervently hope for enhanced working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	148	2208	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.175438596491228	0.0526315789473684	0.2456140350877192	0.1403508771929824	0.087719298245614	0.0175438596491228	0.087719298245614	0.032258064516129	2.938415829895253	2.8967542206162515	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.	sadness	1.0	6.0	5.0	43.0	50000.0	6.5	4.5	1.5	5.5	6.0	3.714	1.429	3.571	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	64	22	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.3636363636363636	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.9553547417921835	2.881948487266132	low	low	An essay written by a 43.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.

On one hand, the police and the community are striving to protect the invaluable wildlife and its inhabitants, while on the other hand, the village likely relies on the animal either for nourishment or to generate income due to their profound poverty. I can comprehend the profound desperation one might experience in a developing country, where it could seem as though law enforcement is severing or appropriating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are simply endeavoring to safeguard and uphold what they perceive to be right. They definitely don't deserve to endure such a brutal attack, and it astounds me that they managed to survive such a savage beating. I sincerely hope that more measures are taken to assist both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	137	2240	0.1272727272727272	0.109090909090909	0.0545454545454545	0.1636363636363636	0.0181818181818181	0.2545454545454545	0.1454545454545454	0.0727272727272727	0.0181818181818181	0.0363636363636363	0.0666666666666666	2.899099343860642	2.690580284502506	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

I would hope to muster the strength to do my best, but I understand how deeply depressing and hopeless it can feel when one's entire life is upended by a storm, with uncertainty looming over the availability of the next meal.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	90	2224	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.05	2.992780915494329	2.8516244408861326	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

6.333333333333333	6.125	It is incredibly saddening to witness the shift in the circumstances and protection afforded to immigrants. Having come across an article detailing the latest events in Germany, a country that was once known for welcoming immigrants, it is disheartening to see the current toughened approach. I am overwhelmed with remorse and profound anguish for those individuals who are truly in need of sanctuary, something Germany was previously renowned for offering. Optimistically, the situation will take a positive turn.	hope/sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	150000.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.286	3.857	3.0	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	78	2201	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.2352941176470588	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.7251545489214	2.6071222029650083	medium	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article evoked profound distress on multiple levels. I find it impossible to empathize with the girl in question because I could never envision my parents subjecting me to such a situation. The fact that her parents have been released from jail is truly unsettling, as their actions indicate a clear threat to society, especially considering they committed these acts against their own child. It is my sincere hope that these individuals never cross paths with another innocent child. Protecting one's children is an inherent responsibility, and it is disheartening to acknowledge that this girl can never regain her stolen childhood. The aftermath of such an ordeal would undoubtedly shatter one's trust in others and make living a normal life a formidable challenge. I pray that she receives the necessary assistance she needs to heal.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	135	2255	0.1267605633802817	0.1126760563380281	0.056338028169014	0.1126760563380281	0.0704225352112676	0.1549295774647887	0.1549295774647887	0.0985915492957746	0.028169014084507	0.0845070422535211	0.0625	2.928614356139758	2.8882576701593954	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Upon reading an article on the recent developments in Germany, a country that was previously celebrated for its support of immigrants, it becomes apparent that the situation has become more arduous. This fills me with remorse and a deep sense of pain for those who genuinely require a place of refuge, something that Germany was well-known for providing in the past.

The authorities and the local population are both driven by different motives: safeguarding the invaluable wildlife and its habitats, versus the villagers' potential reliance on the animal for sustenance or income due to their impoverished circumstances. I can envision the extreme desperation one might feel in a developing nation, where it could appear that law enforcement is depriving or confiscating their sole means of survival. These unfortunate individuals, however, are merely attempting to safeguard and uphold what they believe to be just. They certainly don't deserve to endure such a vicious assault, and it astonishes me that they managed to survive such a merciless thrashing. I sincerely hope that greater efforts are made to support both the police and the village.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	130	2239	0.0714285714285714	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	0.1904761904761904	0.0238095238095238	0.2619047619047619	0.1666666666666666	0.0476190476190476	0.0238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0666666666666666	2.852581034531611	2.6664287201571537	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The fact that people would abandon their parents and elderly relatives during times of war is beyond comprehension. Additionally, the scarcity of food in their homes exacerbates the situation. They constantly face attacks and lack access to basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My earnest desire is for the cessation of wars and for these individuals to receive the necessary assistance to rebuild their lives and homes. It is crucial to prioritize greater efforts in donating to charities that aid these regions. While I can understand why some would be hesitant to travel and reside there, given the high risk of death from airstrikes, the least these people should have is access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	146	2221	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0714285714285714	0.119047619047619	0.0238095238095238	0.2142857142857142	0.1904761904761904	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	3.109474679825728	2.8650273029390023	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently came across an article that was both captivating and profoundly melancholic. It featured a woman who lived in the UK and held the remarkable position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What struck me was the astonishing fact that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It is truly remarkable to envision running an entire magazine at such an early stage in life. However, her existence was plagued by a lifelong struggle with depression, which she openly addressed in a book. Battling her mental health issues, she sought help and was admitted to a mental hospital. Tragically, despite being cleared by the hospital, she chose to walk into the ocean and met a heartbreaking fate. The lack of adequate assistance she received is truly saddening.

5.0	3.125	This article resonates strongly with me, as it introduces a perspective I wholeheartedly endorse. It hadn't occurred to me before how locations like zzos and theme parks can be teeming with young individuals who should not be exposed to smoking. I believe that treating cigarettes similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is not allowed, is a sensible approach. When children observe others smoking, they perceive it as the norm and acceptable behavior. Shielding this generation from such influences can empower them to make better choices in the future and lead healthier lives. By implementing this proposed ban, we have a genuine opportunity to decrease the number of potential new smokers and eliminate the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am fully supportive of this ban and see no negative repercussions from its enforcement.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	135	2267	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.4074074074074074	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	2.601544240108423	2.6075093429763534	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	2.125	I recently came across a truly intriguing yet profoundly disheartening article. It revolved around a woman who resided in the UK and held the esteemed position of being the founding editor of Elle magazine. What amazed me was that she embarked on this journey at the young age of thirty. It's remarkable to imagine running an entire magazine at such a tender age. However, her life was marked by a long-standing battle with depression, which she chronicled in a book. Struggling with her mental health, she was admitted to a mental hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, despite being cleared by the hospital, she tragically walked into the ocean and met her untimely demise. The fact that she didn't receive the necessary assistance is undeniably heartbreaking. It is my sincere hope that all our friends are aware of our unwavering support, knowing that we stand by them through all their struggles.	hope/sadness	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	149	2233	0.0909090909090909	0.0227272727272727	0.0681818181818181	0.1818181818181818	0.0681818181818181	0.2272727272727272	0.1136363636363636	0.1136363636363636	0.0	0.1136363636363636	0.0357142857142857	2.935014822506919	2.822885791321533	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

The fact that some individuals would abandon their parents and elderly family members amidst the chaos of war is beyond comprehension. To make matters worse, their homes are devoid of sufficient food supplies, leaving them in a state of extreme vulnerability. They face incessant attacks and are unable to obtain even basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My utmost hope is for the cessation of these wars and for these people to receive the necessary assistance in rebuilding their lives and homes. It is vital to dedicate more effort to donating to charities that actively support these areas. While I understand the reluctance of some to travel and reside there, considering the high probability of death from airstrikes, it is essential that these individuals, at the very least, have access to fundamental necessities such as food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	166	2223	0.1509433962264151	0.0377358490566037	0.0754716981132075	0.0943396226415094	0.0377358490566037	0.1886792452830188	0.1886792452830188	0.1320754716981132	0.0377358490566037	0.0566037735849056	0.024390243902439	3.025683770249182	2.842196325336194	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

It sheds light on the fallibility of scientific understanding and the vast realm of knowledge that remains beyond our grasp. The discovery that these animals, previously unaffected by the disease, now carry it raises alarming questions about potential genetic mutations and the subsequent spread of the ailment. The sorrowful reality is that these small creatures endure immense pain without any means of alleviating it. I earnestly hope that extensive research will be conducted to find ways to curtail the disease's transmission before it leads to the extinction of the entire species. I am grateful to the conservationist who noticed and drew attention to this issue, prompting others to express similar concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	124	2232	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.2926829268292683	0.1707317073170731	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.024390243902439	0.025	2.7926370116267147	2.703932382352076	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

They were merely fulfilling their job responsibilities when this unfortunate explosion, caused by sheer carelessness, resulted in the loss of their lives. It is truly tragic that the awareness of the life-threatening and unsafe working conditions did not prompt immediate closure. Although I am glad that around 1,000 establishments are scheduled for closure, I strongly believe that more comprehensive measures are required. The formation of a council and the implementation of regulations, similar to the US's OSHA, should be prioritized to safeguard workers and ensure the strict adherence to safety measures for the preservation of human life. As a consequence of the failure to act promptly, families are now left without their sons, fathers, and a source of income that could have been easily avoided. I earnestly hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	145	2207	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.125	0.0357142857142857	0.0892857142857142	0.054054054054054	2.9157967974667645	2.795032757138069	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

6.0	5.875	Being a woman myself, I find this article deeply unsettling. Despite the multitude of movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women in America, it is disheartening that we have not yet achieved the top spot in all aspects of gender equality. In my opinion, one of the reasons why fewer women are working or reaching senior positions is the societal judgment faced by hardworking women who prioritize their careers over having children. Furthermore, the fact that women, on average, earn only 50 percent of what men do indicates that we still live in a predominantly male-oriented world, providing little motivation to strive for higher positions. However, I believe that by placing a stronger focus on girls' education and promoting their involvement in STEM subjects, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in fields like math, science, and technology, where women's participation is currently lacking. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	160	2244	0.0	0.0294117647058823	0.1470588235294117	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.3529411764705882	0.0588235294117647	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.1470588235294117	0.1071428571428571	2.756987282125528	2.681454298686307	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.5	5.625	"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

6.0	6.0	This article deeply troubled me on various levels. Imagining myself in the shoes of the girl described is inconceivable because I could never fathom my own parents inflicting such pain upon me. The fact that her parents are now out of jail is incredibly disturbing, as their actions present a significant danger to society, particularly considering they perpetrated these acts against their own child. I fervently hope that these individuals never encounter another vulnerable child. As parents, our foremost responsibility is to protect our children, and this girl can never reclaim the innocence of her childhood. It is unimaginable how one could trust others or lead a normal life after enduring such horrific experiences. Her mental well-being must be profoundly impacted, and I earnestly wish for her to receive the necessary support and guidance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	134	2256	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.1162790697674418	0.0697674418604651	0.2558139534883721	0.1162790697674418	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.1162790697674418	0.0454545454545454	2.9823536598803804	3.008944842818962	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.0	3.125	I find myself in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed in this article. It has shed light on a perspective that had not previously crossed my mind: the abundance of young minds in places like zzos and theme parks who should not be exposed to smoking. In my opinion, cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, with restrictions on public consumption. When children witness others smoking, they internalize it as the norm and socially acceptable behavior. By shielding the current generation from such influences, we can lay the foundation for them to make better choices and prioritize their health in the future. The proposed ban holds a real possibility of reducing the number of potential new smokers and eradicating the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I wholeheartedly support this ban and believe it will have no negative consequences if implemented.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	142	2268	0.0	0.0	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.2962962962962963	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0344827586206896	2.568658326668702	2.509329733274858	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Imagining myself in a similar situation with my family, I can't help but acknowledge the overwhelming challenges one would face.

6.0	6.0	I find articles like this incredibly relatable. It truly emphasizes the importance of safeguarding and closely monitoring older individuals, as this type of situation is unfortunately quite common. Many seniors endure the challenges of dementia, leaving them disoriented and highly susceptible to getting lost. The mere thought of this happening to my own parent or grandparent fills me with profound sorrow. Imagining them wandering aimlessly, without a coat, feeling cold and terrified, is truly heartbreaking. I feel an immense sense of gratitude towards the officers who found her before any unfortunate incidents occurred. My sincerest wish is for her to be swiftly reunited with her family, and for effective preventive measures to be established, ensuring that such incidents never happen again. Perhaps, given the circumstances, the family might consider seeking additional support, such as a group home, to provide the necessary care and assistance.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	144	2246	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0930232558139534	0.0232558139534883	0.2558139534883721	0.1860465116279069	0.1395348837209302	0.0232558139534883	0.0930232558139534	0.0714285714285714	3.054081726553815	2.873029219740168	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

The poignant aspect lies in the fact that he was merely assisting his family by tending to the crop when he tragically met with an accident.

Her harrowing experiences were completely inappropriate for someone her age, and they were truly horrifying and unsettling.

6.0	5.875	As a woman myself, I find this article deeply concerning. Despite the numerous movements, awareness campaigns, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that fewer women are pursuing careers or reaching senior positions because our society often stigmatizes hardworking women who choose not to have children. Moreover, it is evident that we still live in a male-dominated world, with women, on average, earning only half of what men earn, creating little incentive for upward mobility. By placing greater emphasis on girls' education in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to excel in math, science, and technology—an area where many women currently face challenges. The future fills me with hope for the success of my gender.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	131	2242	0.0	0.0	0.1363636363636363	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.3636363636363636	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.125	2.7156766262428174	2.664707247296594	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Despite the progress made through various movements, awareness efforts, and activism for women's rights in America, we should be leading the way in all aspects of gender equality. I believe that the decreasing number of women in the workforce or in senior positions is a result of the societal pressure on women who work hard but choose not to have children. Additionally, the persisting gender pay gap, with women earning an average of 50 percent less than men, creates little motivation to strive for higher positions. By focusing more on girls' education and encouraging their participation in STEM fields, we can empower the next generation of women to feel confident in mathematics, science, and technology, which are areas where many women currently lack representation. The future instills hope in me that my gender will succeed.	hope	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	146	2243	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.28125	0.09375	0.0	0.0	0.1875	0.074074074074074	2.7804005154514253	2.7385652984624067	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

It is disheartening that despite being aware of the hazardous and insecure working conditions, no action has been taken to shut down these facilities. While I appreciate the closure of approximately 1,000 establishments, I believe more needs to be accomplished. It is crucial to establish a governing body and implement regulations similar to OSHA in the US, ensuring the protection of workers and the implementation of all necessary precautions to safeguard human life. Currently, families are left bereft of their beloved sons, fathers, and sources of income, when a simple closure could have prevented this loss. I fervently hope for improved working conditions in the future.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	133	2206	0.0816326530612244	0.0408163265306122	0.0816326530612244	0.1020408163265306	0.0408163265306122	0.2244897959183673	0.1836734693877551	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1020408163265306	0.0357142857142857	3.0012886178493576	2.916732470700339	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.0	3.125	This article presents a viewpoint I strongly agree with. The idea of how places such as zzos and theme parks are filled with impressionable young minds who should not be exposed to smoking had never crossed my mind. I believe that cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is prohibited. When children witness others smoking, they perceive it as normal and acceptable. By shielding this generation from such influences, we can promote healthier choices and a brighter future. Implementing a ban like this holds the potential to significantly reduce the number of new smokers and eradicate the societal appeal of smoking for future generations. I fully support this suggested prohibition and foresee no negative consequences in enforcing it.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	121	2266	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.2580645161290322	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.459469704803454	2.499544825667995	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This article is incredibly distressing. Reading about the struggles endured by individuals in other parts of the world is profoundly disheartening. It is unfathomable to think that people would forsake their parents and elderly family members during times of war. To compound matters, their homes lack sufficient food, leaving them in a dire situation. They face constant attacks and are deprived of basic medications that we often take for granted in the US. My sincerest hope is for an end to these wars, allowing these people to receive the assistance needed to rebuild their lives and homes. Donating to charities dedicated to helping these regions requires heightened efforts. While I understand the hesitation some may feel about traveling and living there, given the high likelihood of death from airstrikes, it is imperative that these individuals at least have access to essential food items and clothing.	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	145	2222	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.048780487804878	0.0975609756097561	0.073170731707317	0.1951219512195122	0.1951219512195122	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.073170731707317	0.0344827586206896	3.1115116042551176	2.900474509340724	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.125	I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.	sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	95	55	0.2045454545454545	0.1136363636363636	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.1	2.8232895502322544	2.7214361762141253	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

5.833333333333333	5.75	After reading an article on the consequences of Donald Trump's election, it's clear that Islamophobia has surged. The impact of his extensive judicial appointments has set our country on a downward trajectory, causing long-lasting harm. It is my earnest wish that greater attention is given to the corruption and urgent requirement for a transformative overhaul of American politics during his tenure.	hope	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	39000.0	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	61	2257	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0	2.3117200381277523	2.1020599466475893	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

Without the wilderness, the animals will have nowhere to live, and without the wilderness, what will our animals be forced to live in. What I want them to remember is that they are the ones living in the environment, not the environment invading on our lives. We must take care of it in order to make sure that we have a sustainable environment our children's children.	neutral	2.0	5.0	1.0	37.0	29999.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.714	4.143	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	92	171	0.1764705882352941	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.0	0.1176470588235294	0.0769230769230769	3.2155395621941008	3.140686725801233	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 29999.0$.

It's just a side effect, I think there are many medicines out there that have depression as a side effect. It is something that individuals should be aware of, but nothing critical.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	56	34	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.4	0.4	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.555989979550409	2.5030134589945705	low	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The vast majority of these people just want to live and build something for themselves. It is of no fault of their own that they were unfortunate enough to be born within the fist of a crazed dictator.	sadness	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	63	39	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.2	0.2666666666666666	0.2	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.8027466271685846	2.764234477636885	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	hope/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	136	1593	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.24	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.0526315789473684	2.9615192213757	2.7765868181672064	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.
