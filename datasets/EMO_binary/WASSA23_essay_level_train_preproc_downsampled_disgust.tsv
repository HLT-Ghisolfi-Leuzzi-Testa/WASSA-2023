What this man did is unforgivable. I hope he has a mental illness. I cannot think of any other reason why someone would do something so cruel.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	58	127	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.03125	0.09375	0.1875	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.125	2.8301086201111736	2.970777797834731	medium	high	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again. Attorney Al Gerhardstein, who represents the DuBose family, said they want another trial and can’t understand why the jury couldn’t reach a conclusion. “With the video	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	131	177	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.2777777777777778	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8319663967427458	2.859068827652776	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I hate that the birds and oceans are being polluted by humans so badly. I hate we are not changing and helping the environment. 	disgust	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	63	2104	0.08	0.16	0.0	0.04	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.12	0.16	0.04	0.0	2.9876990652136333	2.895573140780029	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

It makes me angry that we are killing this planet and there are so many people that are simply too stupid too admit it is happening and fix it.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	79	128	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.2105263157894736	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.817126849902847	2.9663100453640183	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	105	19	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.745087308750816	2.573490038513232	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

6.0	5.125	I just read this horrifying article. I am actually not sure that I should even tell you about it because it was so disturbing. It was about this woman who was on the Dr. Phil show. When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it.

Impressive muscle control allows skunks to target their enemy's face at a distance of over 2m.Without this deterrent, the slow-moving skunks would be unable to escape from predators.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	94	208	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.3684210526315789	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.0	2.793035024388823	2.759541580021512	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

I would hate to think that I had to have a male escort when I left my home. They aren't treated as equals, and often men don't even consider them equal as their family pet! &lt;Many of the women can be abused, physically and sexually, and they are considered to be the problem, not the abuser! I hope they are able to win by the petition, and will be able to have a bit more freedom!	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	107	98	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1904761904761904	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0909090909090909	2.931899764178178	2.838940674488265	medium	low	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

Day two was no different, nor the days following. Since Election Day, there have been more than 200 acts of election-related intimidation and harassment across the U.S., according to a survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center. People from all types of communities ― black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, Asian, queer people, women ― have been physically harmed, slandered with hate speech or been the targets of racist graffiti.

1.0	1.25	This story specifically doesn't make me feel anything, since I don't know these people and I feel like if I tried to have emotions for every victim of a crime I read about that would just require too much mental effort. In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

1.5	3.5	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	disgust/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	128	2042	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.1034482758620689	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.1724137931034483	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0689655172413793	0.0689655172413793	0.0909090909090909	2.611000319206454	2.4650590113548265	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

3.833	4.375	I feel that it is a common thing to have intentions misplaced. The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

She is very brave for telling her story and for just being a survivor.	disgust	2.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	25000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.5	6.0	4.143	2.571	3.571	4.2860000000000005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	105	678	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.1025641025641025	0.0769230769230769	0.0256410256410256	0.1282051282051282	0.0	3.096453479940636	3.0635524369202405	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

That was another terrible tragedy which could've been avoided had the proper course of action been taken.	anger	1.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	150000.0	4.0	6.0	5.0	6.0	5.5	3.143	3.0	3.143	2.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	72	262	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.2222222222222222	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0833333333333333	2.763089873328892	2.909254916917258	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

I think by the time our next Presidential election comes around we will be no longer be considered a destination country but anyone in the know.

I haven't met many women who expressed an interest in STEM and most of them didn't even want to talk to people who were into it when I was in college.

The terrorists won't even allow people to leave the city they're holding, to try and reach the Iraqi army nearby who could help them.

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.

He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment.

It seems as if every day I am reading about a case of child sex abuse. I think these people should be killed on site. That would change their minds before commiting sex acts on a child. It just keeps getting worse and worse, more and more common. They will be spared in court. They will more than likely get probation and released right back into the community they victimized.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

1.167	1.125	So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

5.5	3.125	I have pretty strong thoughts and feelings about this. From what I read, I feel like that is a very tragic situation. Us as a society, we are taking advantage of the trees we have here. In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	105	85	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0526315789473684	3.168803304379618	2.9649278441356337	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

4.0	2.0	It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

1.167	1.625	I don't understand why there is so much hate. It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

They deserve life in jail the fact that they are out is just absurd. If they could do this to there own child i think they are to be considered at risk to other children and the community. It shows they have no moral compass and consious. I feel for that girl how you could ever live a normal life or create real relationships after being used for sex for so long is beyond me.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

This is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the kitten receives justice, and that the person who did this is not allowed to hurt any more animals. I think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this crime to go unpunished. I think it would be great if you could share this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future.	disgust	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	124	826	0.0869565217391304	0.1304347826086956	0.0434782608695652	0.1739130434782608	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.1304347826086956	0.0	2.962235586257199	2.972241786915248	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

I feel really worried for animals that depend on the sea ice, polar bears I think really need it. Plus I read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and doesn't get reflected.

5.667000000000001	5.125	This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	95	86	0.1063829787234042	0.1276595744680851	0.0638297872340425	0.1489361702127659	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.1702127659574468	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0909090909090909	2.9422282048245303	3.000730637576451	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

We should leave things the way they are if we know we are not capable of affording these animals what nature will give them. We dont have to keep spoiling everything the nature begot in the name of domination.

The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

4.833	5.375	As we all know, there has been much media on police brutality. There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them. Unfortunately, it's very sad to say, that even if a citizen is innocent, if they don't cooperate to the fullest, the police can physically harm them, even possibly lead to being shot and killed. This is very scary! So, while I don't believe all officers are like this, one is too many!	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	90	99	0.24	0.08	0.0	0.2	0.04	0.28	0.12	0.04	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8699553009574035	2.839025385361612	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

It blows my mind the level of shit people will do in order to make a buck.   It seems like people treat celebrities as if they are not people at all.  People that leave negative comments on celebrity pages are taking it to a new level.  People say the shittiest things to each other when they're hiding behind their computer screen.   This particular guy took it to the extreme by stealing their private photos.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	99	236	0.1020408163265306	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1020408163265306	0.1020408163265306	0.1224489795918367	0.1836734693877551	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0612244897959183	0.074074074074074	2.723743089360931	2.826668841531517	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

3.5	5.5	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	143	1590	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0416666666666666	2.940207057128023	2.766534416358188	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

French people want to help those that have been displaced in the Middle East, but Calais is a mess.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	101	341	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0344827586206896	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0555555555555555	2.6907088215470587	2.667309494402865	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Gilbert and Wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason (birthday, anniversary, or promotion etc.) and how long they thought that feeling would last. People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested.

5.832999999999999	6.0	Megyn Kelly during an interview, repeatedly shaking his finger at her and accusing her of being “fascinated with sex” because she brought up allegations of sexual assault against Trump. In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons.

All we do as humans is destroy nature anyway, and when it comes right down to it, I'm sick of hearing about ""This endangered species, That endangered species."" It is near nauseating to hear people continually express concern over things we cannot even change. The habitats are going to be destroyed, animals are going to die - so what? As humans, we are a plague on the earth, but pretending that is going to change any time soon is silly and fool-hearted.

4.0	4.0	This is horribly to read about. The sheer number of people dying every day, just trying to escape on boats, is quite alarming. Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will. Bring them here and help them find a more peaceful way through thehri own lives.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	114	165	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.0888888888888888	0.0444444444444444	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.0444444444444444	0.0444444444444444	0.0476190476190476	2.9435562990655915	2.9007473278839244	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	83	77	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.0	2.7184653168122166	2.651762222039036	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

It indicated that the tobacco lobby results in weak tobacco control and a low effort among politicians to try and stop people from smoking. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I should care about smokers. The evidence is there for them to see, yet they persist in their bad habits. Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	92	340	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.497491729626756	2.4714053649337906	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward.

3.833	5.875	I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	42.0	88000.0	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	132	1023	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.0217391304347826	0.108695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.0434782608695652	0.0652173913043478	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000.0$.

Anyway, it's really scary to think that at any given moment our hearts can just stop working and then we are gone forever.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	27.0	20000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	3.0	3.0	3.714	3.0	2.857	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	243	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.0	2.9796022053716817	2.8316235753039427	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 20000.0$.

These people are savages and should be dealt with with no sympathy or quarter.  That we pulled out of the region cowardly is disgraceful.  However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.

Economy at all costs, especially when you have two trillion people living in these geographically small countries.  And you wonder why environmentalism is a losing battle.  The U.S. and other civilized countries can do all they want.  If a place like Indonesia is willing to burn down all their forests to manufacture palm oil, you're fighting a losing battle.  Again, I keep getting back to this idea: Why are we considered the barbarians in the world?  Most of the world are one step above apes.  They're heathens.  What Reagan said to Nixon was correct.

It seems typical for the region, however.  Economy at all costs, especially when you have two trillion people living in these geographically small countries.  And you wonder why environmentalism is a losing battle.  The U.S. and other civilized countries can do all they want.  If a place like Indonesia is willing to burn down all their forests to manufacture palm oil, you're fighting a losing battle.  Again, I keep getting back to this idea: Why are we considered the barbarians in the world?  Most of the world are one step above apes.  They're heathens.  What Reagan said to Nixon was correct.

4.5	5.25	Another article I read showing a death of African American driver by a police. I really upset me reading this article. That unnecessary force was used to handle the situation. Its crazy that the first thing on the police mind is to shoot to kill. I feel uneasy every time seeing and reading about situation like this where a situation could of been handled in a different way. Understandable that they work in a high intense environment but that why they train and follow protocol.	disgust	1.0	4.0	5.0	29.0	25000.0	4.5	6.0	4.5	4.5	6.0	4.2860000000000005	2.143	3.286	4.143	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	85	612	0.2093023255813953	0.1395348837209302	0.0465116279069767	0.0697674418604651	0.0465116279069767	0.1162790697674418	0.1860465116279069	0.0930232558139534	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0	2.746246624905177	2.833867030608412	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

Any time you have a person who has authority over another person, eventually things will go bad.  Whether it's kings demanding that they get to deflower any bride before her wedding day (as a law) or our own United States government attempting to strip more and more freedoms from us when we're already slaves... These are the acts of corruption.  These are the acts of cowardice, scum-bag gangsters that wear suits.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	59000.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	3.857	5.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	92	238	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.0	0.074074074074074	0.3333333333333333	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.0	2.6267976548718903	2.7109584805912745	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 59000.0$.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	136	2110	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.3529411764705882	0.1764705882352941	0.0588235294117647	0.0	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

It is honestly just terrible. It feels like we are seeing more and more of this everyday. Humans really need to come together and realize that we are all the same, and there is not reason to cause each other harm and pain such as this.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	50000.0	4.5	5.5	3.0	2.5	5.0	3.143	1.714	3.429	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	76	133	0.1923076923076923	0.1153846153846153	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0	2.9931520559747558	3.0043445824634736	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

1.0	2.5	"As if our immigration problem couldn't get any worse! Now Haitian immigrants are going through Mexico to show up at the Cali border! I hope they all get deported. Immigrants are nothing but a plague on this country, for the most part, save the elite ones we get from areas of Asia. The Haitians would do nothing to stimulate our economy, would all end up on public assistance, and would cost taxpayers like you and me! We really can't afford to keep letting them stream into the country, but the good news is that most of them are being booted. We just need to change ""MOST"" to ""ALL"" because there is nothing good that can come of letting them in the country!!"	disgust	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	122	374	0.1025641025641025	0.0	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.2051282051282051	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0256410256410256	0.1282051282051282	0.25	2.6721329538423984	2.555646818329972	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

Instead of exploring other alternatives, such as natural energy sources, they will go and march their way to Africa and claim innocent lives just to put money in their pockets.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

3.0	2.5	Hello friend,  This article cracks me up. As someone who hates Trump, I think it's hilarious. Realistically, the mother should've just talked to her son about the reasons she dislikes Trump. Trying to convince him that Trump is a immoral person would've been a better use of her time. What makes me mad though, is that people called CPS on her. People always trying to get involved in everybody's business.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	70	312	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1153846153846153	0.1111111111111111	2.292478702393535	2.3942503423044403	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.

3.5	5.875	I just heard about more poaching of rhinos, animals in general! This one was a black rhino very old, but what I don't understand is why people are so money focused and are willing to kill for it? Out of all the ways we could be making money why is killing animals something pretty defenseless if we just leave them alone, the main focus for money for some? I've never had a desire to hurt an animal for any reason, you?	disgust	2.0	5.0	1.0	33.0	39000.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.5	5.0	4.0	2.286	2.857	4.143	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	81	996	0.0980392156862745	0.1176470588235294	0.0784313725490196	0.0980392156862745	0.0784313725490196	0.1568627450980392	0.1372549019607843	0.1372549019607843	0.0196078431372549	0.0784313725490196	0.0666666666666666	3.004304460583302	2.873723130045944	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 39000.0$.

4.0	4.0	This article I just read is incredibly intellectually dishonest. The notion that women were somehow exiled from talking points and inclusion in the Trump campaign is actually nauseating. This kind of narrative is truly what the modern liberal exists upon. It's disgusting.

5.5	1.875	This was terrible! I'm so glad that those guys got arrested. It's never okay to throw bottles at people, I don't care who you are or what the circumstances are. That poor kid almost died. I mean why? For nothing. Because of a stupid fan rivalry? What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I can't see how you could take a different stance on it, but just for kicks and giggles. I mean I'm all for sports and stuff but if you get out of control and you hurt someone, that's on you. This is supposed to be fun. These games aren't supposed to be violent, and continued behavior along these lines could damage the reputation of the game, the fans, and the organization. I don't condone it at all and I don't think that you should either. So there you go, that's that. There you go. That's that.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.
