It was truly amazing that he survived all that time without food or shelter. It goes to show that you should go looking for somebody missing no matter how long it takes because they might still be out there. It is an amazing story that will inspire and bring hope to the world.	joy	1.0	2.0	2.0	33.0	24000.0	6.0	5.0	4.0	7.0	6.5	4.143	1.143	3.286	4.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	78	1561	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1944444444444444	0.2	2.8617964594177936	2.7951724021974758	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 24000.0$.

I think I could survive in the woods like that. I know a lot about native plants so I would do pretty good. Of course as long as it wasn't some place cold. The jungle would be hard but only if there are wild animals that would like to eat you for their food. At least the weather would be better.	joy	2.0	2.0	1.0	63.0	35000.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	90	753	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.1153846153846153	0.1923076923076923	0.0769230769230769	0.2692307692307692	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.1923076923076923	0.0714285714285714	2.5643622520283733	2.318742710806486	low	low	An essay written by a 63.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000.0$.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	joy	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	30	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935160266587608	2.799303973765628	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

I think it was interesting and informative to know of some of their malpractices. The settlement is good and correct to right some of the wrongs they have done and people they have harmed. It will help the people they have harmed and seek to right the wrong and there will be justice. Wells Fargo is big and they should not harm others and the articles is well told on what happened to them and what they did in detail.

2.833	3.625	The article is very well-written and relatively thoughtful.  I also find it heartwarming and touching at times.  However, it's also overflowing with this self-centered ignorance that our internet culture has engendered over the last decade. We are specks, even on this planet, even in our own cities.  It's an enormous world--unfathomably large.  To think that it is not irrational to be afraid of terrorism is stupid.  Statistically speaking--i.e. RATIONALLY speaking--it is absurd to be afraid of terrorism.  And yet intelligent people are.  They see the world too much through their phones, through the images (images, not tangible things) depicted on it.  The world that exists in our phones does not exist in reality.  They are two distinct things.

Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be.

In the beginning I wrote about how our friendship began, and wrote about all of my favorite memories with her from as far back as I could remember. Our first interaction to when we first started texting and getting to know each other, all the way up to when I wrote the letter. She is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how grateful she is to have me as a friend. I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me. I made the end of the letter forward looking and wrote of how grateful I considered myself to be because she was in my life, and how I hoped that wouldn’t change for a long, long time.	joy	1.0	4.0	3.0	28.0	456566.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	2.4290000000000003	3.571	2.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	1215	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.2647058823529412	0.1470588235294117	0.0588235294117647	0.2941176470588235	0.0294117647058823	0.0	0.0	0.1764705882352941	0.1111111111111111	2.972004839518797	2.7761004849593856	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 456566.0$.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population.

I wish that I could help others more when I learn about a problem. When others are suffering I like to be able to help them get over it. I like to be known as a good friend to others who are in need. I have had situations in my life that I wish I had someone to turn to and I did not. That is the person I try to be for my friends.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well.

5.832999999999999	6.0	Megyn Kelly during an interview, repeatedly shaking his finger at her and accusing her of being “fascinated with sex” because she brought up allegations of sexual assault against Trump. In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

I know that you told me after the Access Hollywood tapes that you didn't care about that stuff, that policy issues were more important.	joy	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	105000.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	72	1385	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.125	0.125	2.335301233617333	2.2263251719063346	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000.0$.

The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.

I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	sadness	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	73	50	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.3571428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.570467739636896	2.441225217124561	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	31.0	32000.0	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	105	19	0.1111111111111111	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.745087308750816	2.573490038513232	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000.0$.

Instead of going after industries (probably all American) with fines, they rather close schools because of the pollution and smog.

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

I guess if there were were at least three people involved and only one was seriously injured, those aren't the worst odds.	sadness	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	90000.0	7.0	3.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.428999999999999	2.0	2.571	4.2860000000000005	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	69	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.1904761904761904	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.2	2.5894789173796364	2.629823738827116	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 90000.0$.

3.0	3.5	Overall the problem here seems to be that overuse of resources in a certain area needs to be stopped. Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into. There should also be some sort of testing and filtering system put into place to protect the people.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	65	79	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.781809095659292	2.7405276461087014	low	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

4.0	2.0	It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	45.0	30000.0	4.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.571	2.143	4.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	76	0.0909090909090909	0.0303030303030303	0.0303030303030303	0.1515151515151515	0.0606060606060606	0.2121212121212121	0.2121212121212121	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.1212121212121212	0.0588235294117647	2.829397776583753	2.673230573811172	medium	low	An essay written by a 45.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

6.0	4.625	Reading stuff like this puts the refugee in perspective. There has to be something the international community can do that isn't taking in refugees permanently. The vast majority of these people just want to live and build something for themselves. It is of no fault of their own that they were unfortunate enough to be born within the fist of a crazed dictator.	sadness	1.0	5.0	1.0	28.0	62000.0	4.0	6.0	3.5	5.5	4.0	3.714	2.4290000000000003	3.286	3.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	63	39	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.2	0.2666666666666666	0.2	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.8027466271685846	2.764234477636885	low	low	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

2.667	1.0	I'm glad that the officers that responded to the scene did not get hurt. I am also happy that the loose Emu did not get hurt. This is a hard article to write about. I wish that all police calls ended with a happy ending like this story where everybody gets to go home. I wish the worlds problems where as simple as an escaped emu on the loose. I believe that most police officers are kind and good nature and want to do the right thing, like helping this emu, but they are human and with any humans you will have some bad ones. Once again just happy nobody got hurt.	joy	1.0	6.0	3.0	36.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	112	884	0.14	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.02	0.16	0.1	0.08	0.02	0.12	0.25	3.000001652704397	2.7502532722868587	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

2.5	4.625	I don't know about Bayh. I kind of wish he hadn't run again; I'm glad he's not trying again this time. After reading this story, it's hard to feel sympathetic, even in retrospect. But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	113	1283	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1739130434782608	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.3478260869565217	0.0434782608695652	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.217391304347826	0.1428571428571428	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156656	low	low	An essay written by a 59.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500.0$.
