2.667	2.625	I have a lot of sympathy for everyone worried about the Trump administration. I get it. They're not wrong to be worried. I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	31500.0	4.5	4.0	1.5	3.0	2.0	2.143	3.429	3.143	2.4290000000000003	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	74	339	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.0769230769230769	2.343570702841295	2.3702111880019787	low	low	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31500.0$.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife.

It indicated that the tobacco lobby results in weak tobacco control and a low effort among politicians to try and stop people from smoking. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I should care about smokers. The evidence is there for them to see, yet they persist in their bad habits. Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	92	340	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.3181818181818182	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0	2.497491729626756	2.4714053649337906	low	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

Perhaps neither are good, but how do we fix this?	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	73	70	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0769230769230769	2.978977904394956	2.6756163667824056	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

We hope what happened to Paris never happens again, but we simply need a bit more security and people with their eyes open - not attitudes against an entire religion or people. Consider these unfortunate ways of rallying countries behind one cause of peace.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	167	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0952380952380952	0.0714285714285714	2.7351531835791123	2.730568709058206	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

According to this article that I read online, a police officer was shot to death and another police officer was injured in an ambush. I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	fear	1.0	6.0	3.0	24.0	55000.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	118	829	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.1458333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.91722408565792	2.8410753633042187	medium	low	An essay written by a 24.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

7.0	6.5	In Iraq, Islamic State militants are kidnapping thousands of people at gunpoint to use as shields against the U.S. takeover as the militants move to their last stronghold of Mosul.   This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	68000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	118	711	0.238095238095238	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	3.0356098245975915	2.9107046641393266	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 68000.0$.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

That was another terrible tragedy which could've been avoided had the proper course of action been taken.	anger	1.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	150000.0	4.0	6.0	5.0	6.0	5.5	3.143	3.0	3.143	2.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	72	262	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.1481481481481481	0.2222222222222222	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.0833333333333333	2.763089873328892	2.909254916917258	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

It was not like super tragic but it just makes me think about my own life. It also makes me really think about my living situation. I have never thought about how I live in an apartment building shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences. For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control.

It makes me want to just stay inside.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	50000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	2.0	3.0	2.286	3.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	73	203	0.1071428571428571	0.0	0.0714285714285714	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.0357142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0	2.720136794375946	2.681127828334825	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	97	156	0.1666666666666666	0.1944444444444444	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.0277777777777777	0.25	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0277777777777777	0.0666666666666666	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	low	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.   I think that our country should continue to report on these terrible conditions and try to get aid to Haiti from every source available.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	68000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	137	710	0.1538461538461538	0.0961538461538461	0.0576923076923076	0.0576923076923076	0.0384615384615384	0.173076923076923	0.2115384615384615	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.0192307692307692	0.0	3.056562693868852	2.88894752613392	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 68000.0$.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

What particularly concerns me is the potential for scarring on the cornea and any possible loss of visual acuity. Frankly, I don't like the idea of sticking something in my eye to begin with, and this has turned me off from contact lenses forever.	fear	1.0	4.0	1.0	39.0	48000.0	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	71	760	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.3076923076923077	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8385332220599504	2.622831385171249	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000.0$.

3.5	4.0	Muslim immigration seems to have some unique issues.  I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.

1.167	1.125	So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.125	I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful.

I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.	sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	95	55	0.2045454545454545	0.1136363636363636	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.1	2.8232895502322544	2.7214361762141253	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

So many poor little creatures are at risk for this and that makes me feel so sad. They die such a painful death or have a very bad quality of life.

I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas.

It is heartbreaking to see people fight for land they love it, and it’s heartbreaking for the police to have to shoot people over it. people lose years of their lives in prison over land and cattle and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted in court cases. the whole article was a mess!	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	30000.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.143	3.857	4.571000000000001	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	148	1293	0.1764705882352941	0.1568627450980392	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0196078431372549	0.1764705882352941	0.1764705882352941	0.0784313725490196	0.0588235294117647	0.0392156862745098	0.0	3.121228650029198	2.9456770444719145	medium	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 30000.0$.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

6.0	6.0	Everything about Russia really freaks me out. I think this country really needs to be cut off until they can be a more peaceful society. It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world. He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown. 	fear	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	110	2177	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0909090909090909	2.8069767723153194	2.8888148098844795	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating. If it was a child, however, this is insanity and just horrifying.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	12000.0	5.5	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	82	0.1951219512195122	0.1707317073170731	0.024390243902439	0.024390243902439	0.0	0.073170731707317	0.2439024390243902	0.0975609756097561	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.0	2.429171016767234	2.542875847623198	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000.0$.

4.167	4.875	I just read an article about women encouraging other women to get IUD's before Trump took office. They were worried that trump in office will restrict women's access to affordable birth control. They think because the IUD can last for so long that women should get them in soon. I don't think these women need to be out getting IUD's, there are other ways to prevent pregnancy. If they are really concerned, condoms work well.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	75	249	0.1875	0.0	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.6344320442312887	2.6159840275985844	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

They must have been so afraid once the train started rocking back and forth. I wonder what actually caused this horrible accident in the first place. They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it. The train should be shut down to avoid loss of life while it is investigated and corrected. It seems to be a totally avoidable way to lose a life and needs to have more security measures put into place.	fear/sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	124	2084	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.0	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.2580645161290322	0.1290322580645161	0.064516129032258	0.0	0.0	2.9275548134373968	2.9908286314467967	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

People buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way: either happy, excited or beautiful. Or, they find the product useful in some way, even indirectly such as to support a charity or for altruistic economic reasons.

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either.	anger/fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	136	2194	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.3076923076923077	0.0769230769230769	0.3846153846153846	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.354431713055995	2.2336064560366857	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state."	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	58	0.1875	0.078125	0.078125	0.1875	0.03125	0.171875	0.125	0.078125	0.015625	0.046875	0.1034482758620689	2.7913155017270053	2.886317950921229	low	medium	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

A report I read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix! Well, it certainly is concerning to me! The report, released this month, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand supposedly the hub of the global Fairtrade system. I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply. Well, knowing how you love your coffee just as much as I do, I just knew this would fascinate you!

Hopefully the murderer accused of five counts of murder will not be free and quiet in the streets of this country. I hope that justice can compensate a little to the relatives of the victim. After a 24-hour chase the police found the criminal and even though the victims have not been recognized, they will soon discover who they are.	fear	1.0	5.0	1.0	23.0	53000.0	5.0	4.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	2.857	2.286	2.857	2.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	76	962	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1555555555555555	0.1333333333333333	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.125	2.8975328080832194	2.956373350953746	low	low	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 53000.0$.

1.5	1.875	I just read an article about a very strong Category 5 typhoon, ‘Typhoon Meranti’, which grew stronger as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday. A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	113	609	0.125	0.1666666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.25	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	low	medium	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

It's something, designed by quacks, that is supposed to convert gay or queer people to heterosexual. Are you kidding me? People are who they are in life and are not to be changed, but embraced and supported. The regimen these poor people had to go through in this so called therapy was barbaric, and would not be used in North Korea as a torture.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will.

I have nothing against illegal immigrants either and often feel there should be pathways to citizenship so long as the illegal immigrant commits no wrongdoings and contributes to the success of the economy of the place they are staying in. The problem with Calais in France is that quite often, terrorists disguised as immigrants make their way in through this area and then commit acts of terror which harm French citizens. French people want to help those that have been displaced in the Middle East, but Calais is a mess.	neutral	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	101	341	0.2413793103448276	0.1034482758620689	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0	0.0344827586206896	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.0555555555555555	2.6907088215470587	2.667309494402865	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	128	185	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.282051282051282	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.064516129032258	2.976505059449956	2.831572665407568	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

However, it is clear that there were so many problems with the company, including the CEO, that the company has been doomed for a while. It's a shame the company was so poorly mismanaged. Maybe if they had a different CEO, they would have been able to survive.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	38.0	50000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.571	4.0	4.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	62	310	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.1904761904761904	0.238095238095238	0.1428571428571428	0.0952380952380952	0.0476190476190476	0.0	2.576060778992088	2.3912535729375057	low	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I know we were talking the other day about being worried about getting stuck in a situation like this because of all the recent shootings. I think this story was a real eye opener for me, because it shows just how easy something like this happening would be. I feel that what you said about mental health and paying more attention to the youth is really another central point to this story. This story made me think even more about owning a gun and having a open carry permit to keep safe and be able to protect my loved ones and family.	fear	1.0	4.0	2.0	27.0	35000.0	6.0	6.0	2.0	6.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	2.286	3.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	119	828	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.948809108057129	2.7812604972856665	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old hispanic or latino male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	133	1400	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.032258064516129	0.1612903225806451	0.0	0.1612903225806451	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

Impressive muscle control allows skunks to target their enemy's face at a distance of over 2m.Without this deterrent, the slow-moving skunks would be unable to escape from predators.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	94	208	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.3684210526315789	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.0	0.0	2.793035024388823	2.759541580021512	low	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation.	hope/sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	93	1589	0.15625	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.09375	0.125	2.921052661132437	2.8826445785555053	medium	low	An essay written by a 38.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000.0$.

Van Niekerk said they were called last weekend to assist a ranger who had caught a poacher near Sabi river. “My colleagues and I, with four Mozambican police officers, were transporting the poacher to the station, which was about 30km away, when he escaped from the vehicle. I chased after the poacher and caught him. I handed him back to the police officer. Suddenly, a mob from the community started moving towards us,” said Van Niekerk. The police officers who were with them ran away. “We, the rangers, were the targets.	neutral	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	106	270	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.9782039420410413	2.8460185325725846	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

4.167	3.5	Thomas referred the case to the full court, and shortly before midnight, the justices issued an order granting Arthur’s stay request. The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings. I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried. I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	116	283	0.1739130434782608	0.217391304347826	0.0217391304347826	0.0	0.0217391304347826	0.0434782608695652	0.3043478260869565	0.1304347826086956	0.0869565217391304	0.0	0.0	2.873318764423922	2.927632080674066	low	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

It makes me upset to know Native American tribes are being affected by drought to the point of possibly ceasing to exist. I have Native American heritage and feel that this population should be cared for by our government before segments of third world countries. I don't like the fact that air pollution is a problem or a salty lake is drying up in Iran but I understand our environment is controlled by God. We, as a nation, choose our battles sometimes based on the wrong things.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them. Unfortunately, it's very sad to say, that even if a citizen is innocent, if they don't cooperate to the fullest, the police can physically harm them, even possibly lead to being shot and killed. This is very scary!

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas.

6.0	1.5	The medical profession is clueless according to three articles I just read. They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	124	215	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0256410256410256	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.0416666666666666	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

No, but I think it's probably best to be more modest about what you post. I mean, just for safeties sake. I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed.

It must be a nerve-wracking job to be a police officer, knowing that at any moment someone could attack you for no good reason.	fear	2.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	24000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.5	2.5	3.286	3.143	2.4290000000000003	2.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	66	308	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2	0.0666666666666666	0.3	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.1818181818181818	2.698154769423656	2.907031966055945	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 24000.0$.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

I think there is more to the story that should have been released, but because the person was an officer they would rather leave the situation as quiet as possible.

Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again.

I wonder why people can not relate to other people and just help.	hope/sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	37.0	40000.0	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	66	1592	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.0666666666666666	3.183782188553809	2.992304381759148	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

There is a need for cooperation but diplomatic intensity is very important. Russia seems to be keeping its intelligence under wraps while Syria is in a power deluge.	neutral	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	54	183	0.1304347826086956	0.0	0.0434782608695652	0.217391304347826	0.0869565217391304	0.2608695652173913	0.0869565217391304	0.0434782608695652	0.0	0.1304347826086956	0.0	2.487194893326043	2.352121607760789	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

2.0	5.625	It is sad that this is what is needed to get some people to pay attention to the immense damage that has been and is continuing to be done by global warming. Something should not have to affect you in order for it to matter. There are things that are a lot more important than your coffee fix. For instance, the people-like the people in the story-whose livelihoods are being put in danger because of global warming.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	126	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.841397005345242	2.8286421250592	low	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

I feel really worried for animals that depend on the sea ice, polar bears I think really need it. Plus I read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and doesn't get reflected. Definitely something to watch and worry about.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	97	155	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.1428571428571428	0.1142857142857142	0.0571428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.1714285714285714	0.1714285714285714	0.0285714285714285	0.0571428571428571	0.0	2.9149898360660176	2.632159364872854	medium	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

4.667	6.0	According to Dr. Jack Drescher, a leading specialist and critic of conversion therapy practices, there is not just one set of practices understood to be used in conversion therapy. “People have tried all kinds of things because none them really work,” he told The Huffington Post. Drescher also said that the majority of research surrounding conversion therapy has taken place on adults who’ve undergone the process, and there is very little research surrounding LGBTQ youth who have been through conversation therapy practices. “But of course you have anecdotal stories,” he said. “Some children have reported running away from home, there have been cases in the news of young people of when their family found out about them or they came out and the family insisted they go to conversion therapy	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	160000.0	4.5	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	3.429	3.429	2.714	3.143	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	130	265	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	3.164152056425312	2.953442137812333	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 160000.0$.

4.167	4.375	It is so sad and terrible how these alternative medicine manufacturers take advantage of people. So many people believe that these things are healthier or will make them feel better than traditional medication, but clearly they just make things worse. These companies pray on uneducated people and it leads to such terrible outcomes. These people don't deserve these health problems.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	50000.0	4.5	5.5	3.0	2.5	5.0	3.143	1.714	3.429	2.571	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	131	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.074074074074074	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.037037037037037	0.1052631578947368	3.101603762743574	3.0136632848456024	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I wouldn't want anything to happen to my baby. This person thinks that we should just put girls in a room with infected mosquito's and let them get bit. I don't think you can prevent immunity that way. I don't think this virus is just going to disappear. I think something has to be done to prevent it from infecting more people. It needs to be controlled. I think it is sad for those that have already gotten the virus. Something has to be done to help these poor people.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	82000.0	6.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	4.714	3.286	4.2860000000000005	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	120	532	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.6584019192930746	2.655248352631076	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 82000.0$.
