1192	6	The loss of human life is always a tragic event, and the death of American soldiers overseas is no exception. I get really angry when I hear that one of our soldiers have lost their life in the Taliban or any other place overseas. These brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy. It's important to honor their sacrifices and remember their service. It's also essential to reflect on the causes and consequences of war and strive to find peaceful solutions to conflicts whenever possible.  I believe that we should work towards a way that conflicts can be solved without the loss of life. For example we can use drones or machines in some situations instead of using one of our own people. I often get quite sad.	65	1	6	1	34	30000	1	test	1	9.15492957746479	4.225352112676057	11.267605633802818	3.5211267605633805	11.267605633802818	2.8169014084507045	0	3.3685394552169594	3.060812971016132
1059	6	Hello mate, it's been a long time since I met you, I hope you are well. I am sending you this message to inform you about a recent incident.   It was two American troops killed fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan; Civilians were affected by the airstrikes. At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and several wounded in an airstrike early Thursday as NATO and Afghan forces battled Taliban militants in northern Kunduz province, Afghan officials and witnesses said. A US airstrike mistakenly targeted an emergency hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 patients and staff. More than 20 civilians from various families were killed. Another provincial council member, Ghulam Rabbani, said 36 people were killed. Know more about this news friend                                  thank you!	53	2	6	1	64	40000	2	test	2	9.67741935483871	0.0	12.903225806451614	4.838709677419355	12.096774193548388	4.838709677419355	0	4.2558493048769375	4.032015904772702

1060	6	My thought was NATO and government forces are increasingly responsible for Afghan civilian deaths. A portion of the strategic provincial capital was briefly overrun by insurgents last month, and Afghan troops assisted by U.S. forces have been trying to clear them from the area. The confusing and deadly drama recalled the tragic events in Kunduz just over a year ago, when the Taliban overran the city and Afghan and NATO forces were trying to beat them back. In the chaos, a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted an emergency hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 patients and staff members. As of late Thursday, NATO officials had not confirmed or commented on the reported deaths of the civilians, who were said to be members of several families living in a neighborhood neared.	47	2	7	1	34	75000	1	test	4	9.923664122137405	3.0534351145038165	16.030534351145036	0.0	12.213740458015266	3.0534351145038165	0	3.720219207155385	3.658061646855158
1060	6	This was a deadly mistake. I believe everybody even countries make mistakes but this was a huge one that ended numerous lives and effected thousands others. I hope that the US will compensate everyone effected. There is no way to bring the loved ones back, but money will certainly help those effected by the tragedy. And then make sure that this cant happen again. I know friendly fire happens but this is crazy.

Although it's bad enough that I have to worry about sending my kids to school and them getting shot. I couldn't imagine my country beeing so un-safe that I needed to pack my family and flee the country.

Would I think of the consequences? Would I only hope for survival? Sometimes it is hard to visualize certain things when those things are too horrible, but I know that I would probably do some things that were not normal for me. For example if I were a fleeing war-torn country, would I be worried about drowning? Probably not.	75	2	5	2	46	75000	2	test	7	2.2222222222222223	2.2222222222222223	7.777777777777778	3.333333333333333	3.333333333333333	3.333333333333333	0	4.690397480284882	4.405245245311534
1072	9	I suppose this explosion was caused by illegal fuel. If the fuel was being transported legally this event could have been avoided and many lives saved. use of illegal fuel is a serious issue that requires action from governments, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to address.

Killed 73 people and injured over 100 they said it was a massacre of sorts because they were burn bodies like everywhere. And they said in the article that they didn't know what caused the explosion, but they had a Assumption of sorts that, a fire near the tanker caused it to explode. It sure is sad.	61	2	2	1	44	21000	1	test	10	10.81081081081081	2.702702702702702	17.56756756756757	1.351351351351351	12.162162162162163	8.108108108108109	0	6.203162905094153	5.783926593165425
1074	9	I read in an article about 73 people that died in an explosion in Mozambique. 110 other people were injured. I think that it was a tanker that exploded. Can you imagine being on the road and something like that happening? 73 people gone, just like that. It really puts into perspective how fleeting life is and how any of us could go at any time. The article said that the incident was ongoing as recovery efforts were hampered by night. Its possible that there are more casualties and injuries. As far as I could tell they didn't know what caused the explosion but two theories are that it was because a fire near the tanker or it could have happened due to lightning near where people were collecting fuel. Imagine going to the pump and dying because of a lightning strike out of your control.	81	1	5	6	38	50000	2	test	11	10.273972602739727	2.054794520547945	12.32876712328767	1.36986301369863	5.47945205479452	7.534246575342466	0	3.0309578581562104	2.7997970200161126

There are plans to do some excavation or deforestation or some such (it is not clear in the article because it seems there's some translation errors). These plans, if gone through with, will likely wipe out half of the existing 1700 orangutan population. Some are opposed and others support this as it can improve the local economy.	33	1	3	1	57	22000	1	test	12	3.947368421052632	0.0	5.2631578947368425	5.2631578947368425	2.631578947368421	2.631578947368421	0	5.704715939179646	5.277658824099129

1083	11	Here are my thoughts on the building refugee/displacement crisis in Afghanistan. It's easy to view a country like Afghanistan as a monolith, especially when I am so far removed from the situation. It's easy to lump them all together and consider their common fate as earned or deserved. But, when I take a moment to think about it, I know that's wrong. Afghanistan is made up of many different people, all with their own hopes and dreams.  I've never been to Afghanistan, maybe I've never even met someone from there, but I feel confident in guessing that most Afghanis just want a safe and peaceful life for themselves and their families. They are victims, in some sort of power struggle that has spiraled out of control, that really has nothing to do with them.  	93	1	6	1	50	66000	2	test	15	5.970149253731343	2.985074626865672	5.223880597014925	8.208955223880597	5.223880597014925	5.970149253731343	0	3.354645590431668	3.0537834438305564
1085	12	I was reading this story about the aftermath of a hurricane in Haiti and people there really need help right now. You know when a calamity strikes in US or other advanced countries, it still takes herculean efforts to get people to safety and provide them with shelter and food and eventual rebuilding. Now imagine, same calamity striking a poor third world country and the suffering of the people there. As the new story describes, people are hugging on to the bags of flour, not letting go, as they desperately need them to survive. Then there is infrastructure damage, water scarcity and so on. We really should do something about them.	74	1	6	5	37	36000	2	test	16	7.207207207207206	5.405405405405405	9.909909909909908	5.405405405405405	11.711711711711713	0.9009009009009008	0	4.213841462113892	3.8645659224501983

The civil war in Syria has been going on for many years without an end in sight and it is thought that one in fifty people have died from it.

1089	11	I read an article about Afghan refugees returning to Afghanistan. Many of them are being deported from the EU and forced to return. I can't imagine living in and experiencing European quality of life and then having to return to a war torn country. It would seem hopeless given that even the government can't seem to do anything. In addition to competing with locals for resources they also have to deal with insurgents. I'm sorry but at that point I'm not sure if I would care about it being legal but I would find a way to get out of there and go somewhere else. I feel bad about anyone there with a family. That is a huge burden having to worry about family members. I've known some people from countries around that area. They seemed so happy.

This is part of a looming humanitarian crisis that aid agencies are struggling to contain. At least another million Afghans are displaced this year. This includes those fleeing violence or conflict, those escaping poverty and drought, and those forced to return from Pakistan and Iran. Afghanistan agreed to accept -Afghan asylum seekers deported from the European Union in October, with the potential for 100,000 to come back. The U.N. refugee agency warns that the sudden increase. It is about financial crisis of Afghanistan people also. It may affect them long last. Most of them need to rectify it as soon.	90	1	6	1	41	110000	2	test	21	9.701492537313433	1.4925373134328357	16.417910447761194	2.238805970149253	10.44776119402985	3.731343283582089	0	3.616786007416005	3.3959341966655767
1094	11	It's interesting how chaotic societies can be when they don't work to actively find systems that allow for coexistence, or to weed out the groups that seek to upend peaceful societies.  In most ways, these people have brought this on themselves.  They've never created a tenable situation.  They've harbored terrorists and allowed war to define their nation.  Peace often comes through war and strife.  These people have never banded together and exacted a stable system on their lands and people.  They've never actively sought stability like civilized places have.  That's my attitude, and I think it's a very scientific, objective perspective.  The systems that people live in are their own responsibility.  Things don't just happen to us.  We have to actively push towards something better.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	1	test	22	4.0	1.6	4.0	5.6	3.2	3.2	0	3.651978282895914	3.3815147213147565

1096	10	Intensive palm oil production is also creating all kinds of environmental fall-out, including air, soil and water pollution, and soil erosion. On a regional scale, palm oil production has also been associated with robbing Indigenous people of their land and livelihoods. This clearing has destroyed critical habitat for many endangered species—including rhinos, elephants and tigers. Burning forests to make room for the crop is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Intensive cultivation methods result in soil pollution and erosion and water contamination. Deforestation for the benefit of oil palm plantations, mining, infrastructure, illegal logging, forest and peat fires, illegal hunting, and illegal wildlife trade are just a few of the threats against the wild orangutans.	96	2	6	1	33	70000	2	test	25	12.82051282051282	19.65811965811966	16.239316239316242	4.273504273504273	9.401709401709402	3.418803418803419	0	4.259420256408697	3.9999598694615046

This is a good venture that will bring employment and economic benefits but it is coming at the expense of endangered orangutans in that province. Already works are underway and the 500 to 1000 orangutans will die or need to be rescued. The population now stands at 750- 1750. Serious intervention is needed.	98	2	6	3	30	50000	2	test	27	4.761904761904762	1.1904761904761905	5.9523809523809526	3.571428571428572	10.714285714285715	3.571428571428572	0	5.548305849092569	5.181070612652921
1099	13	I was quite sad reading about the wolf that got killed by a hunter. There is so much empty space in the Midwest and Northwest of the country that surely there should be enough room for both humans and wolves to coexist without coming into conflict. I would understand there being a problem if the wolf is attacking livestock, but if it is just passing through the area then it should be left well alone. I think few people would disagree with that view if they were to give it some thought.	72	1	6	1	53	90000	1	test	28	7.608695652173913	2.1739130434782608	9.782608695652174	1.0869565217391304	13.043478260869565	2.1739130434782608	0	4.638489140836428	4.270927186535263

He had apparently traveled 700 miles after being collared by Wildlife Activists.  He might have left his pack to find a mate which they often do. That group is working hard with Congress and also on the streets to stop this type of killing of wolves and I truly hope they are successful.	99	2	5	1	59	45000	2	test	29	3.7037037037037033	2.469135802469136	3.7037037037037033	6.172839506172839	4.938271604938271	3.7037037037037033	0	5.942727596870396	5.158605770469873

I hope the Center for Biological Diversity can do something about it and make the exterminators pay for what they've done!

I feel like it could of happened any other way but this way involved guns, bullets, and blood which made it a trifecta of bad feelings for myself.	64	1	6	1	35	52000	1	test	33	11.25	6.25	12.5	7.5	8.75	3.75	0	5.615966159239975	5.311471902858857

1107	13	Hey! I just read a really sad news article about a young wolf who was hunted down by a government sniper. He had traveled over 700 miles before his life was taken away.  It's really important to protect wolves and other animals that play a crucial role in our ecosystems. There are organizations like the Center for Biological Diversity that are fighting for their safety and trying to hold people accountable for their actions.  Let's all do our part to help protect wildlife and spread awareness about their importance. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that these amazing animals can thrive in their natural habitats.	104	1	4	2	28	100000	1	test	36	4.672897196261682	0.9345794392523364	3.7383177570093458	6.5420560747663545	1.8691588785046729	4.672897196261682	0	4.683456754572349	4.1781774431397976
1107	13	"I feel strongly that exterminating wolves in the US is not only cruel, but very short-sighted. As far as I am aware, eliminating a particular apex predator can have a ""domino"" effect on the rest of the environment. For example in Yellowstone, the lack of wolves increased the population of deer, which stripped the trees, and so on. Bringing back the wolves restored the environment to its natural balance, which is of benefit to us all. We need to find a way to live amongst ALL the wild animals in our environment, if we want longterm survival for ourselves and all creatures."	105	2	6	1	44	139000	2	test	37	7.84313725490196	7.84313725490196	7.84313725490196	3.92156862745098	7.84313725490196	3.92156862745098	0	4.431545412953204	4.090662720496393
1108	14	This makes me sad.  A guy who seemed like a decent guy (though who knows) is dead for some unknown reason.  They didn't mention anything about the suspect which makes me think they were probably black or female or something.  Why else would no information be given about who it was other than that the media is covering up it was a black guy?  Anyway, it's sad.  He's a dad and husband and was hunted down by some deranged person.  At least that deranged person is dead and is no longer a threat to anyone.  Hopefully they're rotting in hell where they belong.  Seems a senseless waste, and I feel bad for the family of the victim.

1120	15	It's hard to fathom the pain and suffering that the people of Yemen have endured over the past years. The constant fighting, airstrikes, and shelling have caused immense harm and forced millions to flee their homes. It's especially tragic that those who were supposed to be protected in prisons were instead targeted and killed. It's also difficult to reconcile the justifications given by the Saudi-led coalition for these airstrikes. The claim that the security complex was being used as a command and control center by the Houthis may seem plausible, but it does not excuse the loss of civilian life. The repeated bombing of civilian targets, such as the funeral hall in Sanaa, is not only tragic but also a violation of international humanitarian law.	70	2	4	1	50	30000	1	test	57	9.6	4.8	16.0	1.6	11.2	4.8	0	3.7642552632362936	3.55833231582767

On coming home, I saw seven members of my family, including women and children, killed in the raids. After the deadly 2015 airstrike in Kunduz, a U.S. military investigation led to the disciplining of 16 military members who were said to have made mistakes leading to the strike. Doctors Without Borders called the attack a war crime. Also it is the big crime rate for ever lasting.

I'm sure a lot of people are irate, or even thinking it was some sort of terrorist thing from Jordanians who resent America, or maybe that the Jordanian military has been infiltrated by bad guys.  It's all possible, but war is ugly.  When you put on a uniform you run the risk of getting shot by someone.  If this was bad guys hopefully they string them up.

It's heartbreaking to hear about the loss of life, and my thoughts go out to the families of those who were killed.  The article mentions that the incident was not terrorism-related, and both U.S. and Jordanian authorities are investigating the cause. It's worth noting that Jordan is a close ally of the United States, and military training by U.S. personnel is common in the country.

The lack of aid and supplies in the area is also concerning, with reports of residents running out of food and markets being empty.

Syria is so challenging with the rebel situation and the current government in place. It's so frustrating to hear about people living under these dire conditions. This particular story hit me harder because it talked about people having to flee and leave their elderly parents and relatives behind. How do people survive in these situations at a time in their lives where they need greater assistance from family and the community?

We need to make climate change our number one priority, and do absolutely all we can, otherwise humans and animals will die. 	73	2	7	1	57	104000	1	test	83	5.747126436781609	1.1494252873563218	16.091954022988507	5.747126436781609	12.64367816091954	0.0	0	5.427246541443692	5.232272729345838
1175	18	Can you believe we are on the way to wiping out polar bears? I was reading today that ice is melting faster and that the cold seasons are even getting shorter! Another thing I read is that there are less that 30,000 polar bears left in the world. It is such a shame that we have done this to the world for nothing other than greed. The beauty of this world is in extreme jeopardy and I feel powerless to stop it. Paper straws will only do so much, huge companies need to be held accountable.	108	2	4	1	44	20000	2	test	84	9.375	8.333333333333334	10.416666666666668	3.125	7.291666666666667	3.125	0	4.659306843104644	4.463703520255471
1175	18	I think this is a very sad situation all around. I wish there were more things that we as humans could do to prevent these things from happening but for the most part I feel it is out of our control. I feel that what God sees fit to be will be no mmatter how it makes us think or feel. I also kinda thnk that this is something that is happening slowly over a very long period of time. With that being said, I don't think this will have a big impact on the population for many more years.	38	2	2	1	41	25000	1	test	85	6.0	3.0	6.0	7.0	8.0	3.0	0	4.232578215114234	4.0679082383345095
1174	18	Hey, have you heard about the new study on polar bears and sea ice? It's really concerning. The study shows that polar bears across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season due to earlier spring ice melt and later ice growth in the fall. This loss of sea ice habitat could have a significant negative impact on their feeding and breeding capabilities. As someone who cares about the environment and the well-being of animals, I find this news really upsetting. It's a reminder of the urgent need to take action on climate change.	122	1	6	1	32	152500	1	test	86	6.315789473684211	1.0526315789473684	9.473684210526317	1.0526315789473684	8.421052631578947	4.2105263157894735	0	5.085331763038865	4.505177647696788
1174	18	If the article I read is true, then there is a worrying trend with regard to polar bears. The article told me that there is a rather large decrease in the amount of good ice habitat available each year for polar bears. This seems like it would make it much more difficult for polar bears to survive and may lead to the dwindling of their species. That's just my assumption though based on the article stating that data from the past 30 years has shown that ice starts melting faster in the Spring in polar regions and it takes longer to freeze again in the Fall.	139	1	6	1	34	45000	2	test	87	2.830188679245283	0.0	6.60377358490566	4.716981132075471	1.8867924528301885	5.660377358490566	0	4.14850867042305	3.622891759788938
1171	18	I don't care about polar bears in any sort of emotional sense.  They're just another species that didn't exist for billions of years and now has existed for the blink of an eye, and weepy, weak, ignorant people are going to think that the universe lost something indelible when the polar bears die out.  It's all ephemeral, people.  However, I'm interested in and academic sense in seeing how polar bears respond.  Life doesn't just roll over and die.  It, uh, uh, finds a way.  So while the polar bears' ice is retreating and showing up later and going away sooner, I have to imagine that the 19 groups of polar bears will adapt in some way.  I'm curious to see how that is.  Again, I can't imagine life has lasted as long as it has by just accepting its fate and keeling over when climate changes.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	2	test	88	6.164383561643835	4.794520547945206	7.534246575342466	0.684931506849315	8.219178082191782	4.109589041095891	0	3.087100077906912	2.867212714225529
1171	18	The overall season shift in the Arctic could be a large deal coming up. Possibly the effects are just now beginning to be seen. It is also possible that this data is negligible. Perhaps a season could shift in natural ways or alternates based on irregularities of the Earth's spin. The idea is cause for concern.	137	1	6	6	30	100000	1	test	89	0.0	0.0	1.7857142857142856	3.571428571428571	3.571428571428571	3.571428571428571	0	7.438699542499052	7.372389357604621
1173	18	Hi friend  I just read this really sad article about Polar bears loosing the ability to hunt and survive in their natural habitat. It seems that the ice in the artic has been melting and causing shorter seasons for them then what is normal. Is sad because its happening all around the artic and affecting every polar bear there. 	107	1	2	1	36	10000	1	test	90	6.779661016949153	0.0	6.779661016949153	5.084745762711865	3.389830508474577	1.6949152542372885	0	8.093585083004237	6.962997060843819
1173	18	The article said there were 19 separate polar bear populations that live throughout the Arctic and talked about the Arctic sea ice melting and that's where the polar bears hunt and mate. As to my emotions thoughts and feelings about it. Honestly kind of hard to explain because I read it as they were facts and I do think it's rather sad that the arctic sea ice is melting and that's where the polar bears use and I do a lot of activities like hunting and stuff but the rest of the article to me the way I read it stated information so what kind of emotions am I supposed to have about it? Unless it was more or less referring to climate change I could see it that way too I guess. 	61	2	2	1	44	21000	2	test	91	6.015037593984962	0.7518796992481203	7.518796992481203	4.511278195488722	1.5037593984962403	4.511278195488722	0	3.48811303018206	2.960505146318962
1179	18	global warming is a really important issue that we need to discuss and find ways of slowing it down drastically. We humans are the main cause of this global warming and it affects each and everyone of us and all animals included. I feel for the polar bears that are losing their habitat due to this factor. 	65	1	6	1	34	40000	2	test	92	7.017543859649123	3.5087719298245617	5.2631578947368425	8.771929824561404	5.2631578947368425	7.017543859649123	0	8.429401370151341	7.713105490210464
1179	18	While I am incredibly disappointed in learning this, I'm not too surprised considering I do believe that global warming is a thing and it is starting to affect multiple parts of the world.  I feel really sad in regards to the polar bears and how they are being affected by the melting ice, and I hope that we can do something to help them so that they don't become yet another statistic in the growing numbers of species that are going extinct across the world.  	140	2	2	1	44	5600	1	test	93	4.705882352941177	3.5294117647058822	3.5294117647058822	9.411764705882351	8.23529411764706	7.0588235294117645	0	5.258936418588819	5.069553226885097
1183	19	It is very sad. That poor guy has had a rough life. There is no way he should be deported. All of the other details about his life were irrelevant. He should have been made a citizen when he was adopted. The fact that it wasn't the law already is shameful. How was he supposed to live? How was he even legally adopted if not a citizen?	49	1	6	1	37	12000	2	test	94	2.985074626865672	1.4925373134328357	4.477611940298507	1.4925373134328357	5.970149253731343	0.0	0	6.352546517040232	6.205990511006762
1183	19	Check out this story. It is an outrage that something like this could happen in the United States. This person was wronged by so many institutions that should have been protecting him. An abusive couple should never have been allowed to adopt a child in the first place. The foster families as well as a second adoptive family were also abusive. Obviously there need to be some major changes to the adoption system in this country. We need to do a better job protecting our children. Any child brought into this country and adopted by United States citizens should become a citizen. A child has no say and does not ask to be removed from their home country. An adoption should provide a better life, not lead to abuse. We need to protect future children from ending up in the same situation.	143	2	6	1	42	50000	1	test	95	5.633802816901409	4.929577464788733	4.225352112676057	7.746478873239437	4.225352112676057	0.7042253521126761	0	3.192284195591952	3.111902998147389
1184	19	I just read a story about a person who was brought to our country when he was 3, over 30 years ago. He was adopted into an abusive family, then fostered by another which was equally abusive. He has had a troubled life, and spent time in jail, but has married and seemingly turned his life around over the last few years. He recently applied for a green card, and of course his background check showed all his troubles. That makes him eligible for deportation, and that is what will happen, if it hasn't already. He will leave his wife and family and his home for a country that will be alien to him, and where he will be a total stanger. It seems to me that we have chosen to do things, not because it is right, but because we are afraid of what we can't control, and so control those we can.	145	1	4	1	63	55000	2	test	96	5.194805194805195	2.5974025974025974	7.142857142857142	2.5974025974025974	7.792207792207792	1.948051948051948	0	2.820642645754473	2.7725127539575336
1184	19	I just read this article and it's really messed up. Some people had adopted a Korean boy and brought him way over the the US. They abused him and his sister and they both were split up in the foster care system. This boy was adopted, abused, and abandoned many times. Now that he has a family of his own, they are trying to deport him. It's basically stuff he was sort of forced to do while he was being oppressed, like stealing his stuff back and owning a gun for protection. That ain't even the worst part. None of the people who adopted him registered him to become a citizen. Sometimes Americans are a special type of evil, girl.	144	2	6	3	31	36000	1	test	97	9.166666666666668	5.833333333333334	12.5	3.333333333333333	10.0	1.6666666666666667	0	3.7074440514219056	3.588177890827472
1190	19	I just read about a man who is being deported due to his citizenship status. It's really a sad story -- this man is 41 and has a family of his own, but because his adoptive parents didn't file the proper paperwork on him, he wasn't classified as a US citizen and now he's being deported. His family is going to be torn apart, which is horrible -- it's not just affecting this man, but his family as well. It just seems unnecessarily cruel to do this to him when he wasn't at fault for this situation to being with. I feel like an exception should be made for him.	130	1	2	1	30	36000	2	test	98	6.363636363636363	4.545454545454545	6.363636363636363	2.727272727272727	7.272727272727272	0.9090909090909092	0	4.045484502132434	3.847635677061857
1190	19	I feel very sorry for the individual in this article, Adam Crapser, as he should have received U.S. citizenship as part of the adoption process.   It is unfair to deport him now as he has his own family in the U.S.   There should be some criteria to protect him as a result of the mistakes and lack of controls in place when he was a child going through the adoption system.   I hope that this article brought some attention to his case and that a more informed decision was made with regard to his future.	149	1	7	1	56	275000	1	test	99	3.1578947368421053	3.1578947368421053	4.2105263157894735	7.36842105263158	9.473684210526317	5.2631578947368425	0	4.6491492981991	4.3461337888016205
