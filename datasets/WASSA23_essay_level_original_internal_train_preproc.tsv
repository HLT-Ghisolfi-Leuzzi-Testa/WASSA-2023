It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1593	Hope/Sadness	136	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.07894736842105263	0.1	2.6967456371753937	2.8464004363228184	This article really brings you back down to earth.

She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed.

182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.

470	326	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

369	80	I don't really care about this issue, in part because I don't even understand it.  All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?

I'm very happy to live in this beautiful country and I wish people would stop complaining so much about everything they think is wrong here.  Just be grateful you're not being used as a human shield.  Some of the things going on over there are just atrocious, and as bad as people think it is here it doesn't even hold a candle to that.

I can't imagine the children longing for there parents they are seperated from and longing for some sort of security in there lives. There food is gone there water is unsafe but it is nice to know that aid workers eventhough it is a tough site to see are remaining to truly help out.'An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

359	44	All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.	1.5	1.5	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	1871	Sadness	108	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.07894736842105263	0.1	2.6967456371753937	2.8464004363228184	All this senseless killing is so disturbing.

483	292	This story basically didn't bother me at all, except for the fact that the media seemed to unnecessarily conflate the shooting with the election, even when they later admit that the shooting had nothing to do with the election. There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?

492	218	I just read an article about lead levels in water. I had thought that the water crisis in Flint was just some one off incident. It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

475	297	It must be terrifying to be in a trail derailment like that.  Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

332	148	I just read an article about an elephant that has been kept in captivity and forced to perform as a circus animal for all its life.

They are also held in cages and forced into indentured servitude.

Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

91	233	The things that people do in the name of perversions of faith are absolutely sickening. Religion, something that is used to foster hope, charity and goodwill in the poor and downtrodden is used to exploit and control by those in power. The victims of Boko Haram will most likely see no justice. The rapists, drug dealers and murders will walk free and righteous despite their atrocities.

It's crazy to blame something like this on pharmaceutical companies or anyone other than the drug users themselves, and there is really no excuse for a baby to ever get their hands on someone's medication.

Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.

I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.

71	3	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.	4.0	3.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	2147	Neutral/Sadness	133	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.07894736842105263	0.1	2.6967456371753937	2.8464004363228184	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed.

And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again.

IT's really sad to me when people are this negligent about pets and other people.  Especially vulnerable populations.  Honestly I think whatever punishment she gets, such as an animal cruelty charge, is definitely deserved and she will just have to take that as it comes.

419	301	I had to read this article over twice because toddlers overdosing on opioids is mind boggling! I wonder how and why they have access to this. I know its because sometimes parents drop these pills but if parents are that bad, why are they having kids in the first place? We need laws that test people before they have children in order to make sure they will be good parents.	6.166666666666667	6.0	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	2	train	2197	Disgust/Surprise	70	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.07894736842105263	0.1	2.6967456371753937	2.8464004363228184	I had to read this article over twice because toddlers overdosing on opioids is mind boggling!

288	71	I found this story quite distressing.  It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers.  But I guess they support poaching in that area?  Perhaps it is important to their economy?  Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.

479	53	I just read an article about the amount of food that Americans waste. I knew that it was high, but I never imagined the numbers that people have been putting up for the last few years. Did you know there are people who refuse to eat leftovers?
