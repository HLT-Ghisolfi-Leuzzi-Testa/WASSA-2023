24	281	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	1594	hope/sadness	130	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.25	0.05	0.05	0.058823529411764705	2.921270175908798	2.719409547178719	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 58000$.

430	397	This was sad and I hope they can do something about it.  I hate that the wildlife is suffering since it is so innocent.  Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation.	1.5	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	1589	hope/sadness	93	0.15625	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.09375	0.125	2.9210526611324372	2.8826445785555053	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

405	92	After reading the article, you just can't help but feel really sad for the boy and his family. It's so sad because he was just doing his family a favor by harvesting crops when he fell. It's so unfortunate as well because he was so young and he had his whole life ahead of him. Hopefully his parents are able to move on with life peacefully.	1.0	1.5	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	2	train	1588	hope/sadness	66	0.0	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.25	0.25	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.9249563104202556	2.748423447435396	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

179	283	After reading this article, my immediate reaction is that it makes me a bit angry. I am angry at the fact that women still have to go by rules like this in today's day and age. It makes me angry that women need the permission of a man in order to be able to do what she wants. In today's world, anyone should be able to do anything and their freedom should not be restricted.	1.0	1.625	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	1612	anger	75	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.2	0.06666666666666667	0.0	2.8543224927998705	2.915632599691636	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

458	371	I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	1.0	2.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	1629	anger	126	0.1935483870967742	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.1935483870967742	0.03225806451612903	0.22580645161290322	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.0	0.03225806451612903	0.06666666666666667	2.7327701042089507	2.750775429656553	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

207	201	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.	1.0	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2282	anger	127	0.17142857142857143	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.2	0.02857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.17142857142857143	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.6552150555355345	2.7455473779221067	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	1.1666666666666667	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	1643	anger	126	0.10869565217391304	0.06521739130434782	0.08695652173913043	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.10869565217391304	0.043478260869565216	0.06521739130434782	0.034482758620689655	2.715918480761497	2.6570584722038997	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

359	44	All this senseless killing is so disturbing.  They didn't even seem to have a clear reason why this man was shot.  It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.  It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.	1.5	1.5	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	1871	sadness	108	0.18	0.18	0.02	0.02	0.06	0.08	0.22	0.14	0.08	0.02	0.045454545454545456	2.667612087015073	2.756443482830526	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

196	398	I think it's sad that the golden eagles are being killed by manmade technology.  It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway.	1.3333333333333333	1.125	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	1653	sadness	84	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.36363636363636365	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8372062800669573	2.722851475211297	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

238	245	This is a sad case of what seems like an elderly woman getting lost.  I feel sad for the family involved and the feelings they must have.  Or did they even notice she was gone?  You would think they would be out looking for her if they noticed.  Maybe it was just a lonely old woman by herself which is even more sad.  Either way, I feel like elderly people in general are often overlooked and that is unfortunate.

It mentioned several times that multiple people were brutally raped and even murdered, sometimes by government officials, and this is really distressing and sad.  That is obviously something that should never happen to anyone, so it makes me sad to hear that these people suffered like that.  I think clearly something needs to be done over there but I'm not sure what.	1.3333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	2303	sadness	88	0.25	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.7589625481766666	2.7592402911433704	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Even though you might have it rough, ultimately it is up to you to decide to break the law or use drugs or not.  So they had free will too and could have exercised that.  Regardless, it is still sad that they went through a rough childhood.

They shouldn't be kept in captivity in these circuses and shows I do not think.  This seems inhumane and not right.  I would feel guilty going to a circus seeing elephants parade around.  Maybe at a zoo where they could be in a natural habitat it could be okay but not in a circus where they are supposed to dance around for human entertainment, that is just pitiful and sad.	2.333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2295	sadness	98	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.23076923076923078	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.07142857142857142	2.794337210450996	2.8168635977770826	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

70	138	This French article was so distressing.  Bullying is by far the worst I have seen in my lifetime.  For it be so bad, you feel there is nothing left to do but kill yourself is a massive failure of all those who knew Emilie and did absolutely nothing.   I respect her mom for telling her story in hopes that it comforts others who are thinking the same thing.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened. Also the poor people stuck on the planes for three hours with a supposed shooter on the loose id be terrified.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1705	sadness	138	0.25	0.20454545454545456	0.06818181818181818	0.022727272727272728	0.06818181818181818	0.022727272727272728	0.20454545454545456	0.11363636363636363	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.741474084422063	2.825189701092452	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

It is such a silly way to die over nothing. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2318	sadness	83	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.2647058823529412	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.0	3.271854790109057	3.0850171952986485	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

427	397	this is so horribloe because anything that effects animals hurts me to the core. They are innocent victims and cant really help themselves in this situation. I think alot needs to be done to make sure the river is restored and blockage is taken away so that this does not happen in the future. These fish cant move debris themsleves and i thin more light needs to shine down on what is happening so maybe a council can come together and monitor or take over and make sure the fish are in a thriving enviroment. I thin if an enviromental emergency is declared and especially in a poor country other countries should step in and lend a helping hand to lesson the suffering to innocent life.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1712	sadness	126	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.2692307692307692	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	3.088667514809614	2.938629631783367	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

248	177	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	2.333333333333333	1.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	1898	neutral	122	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.06451612903225806	0.1935483870967742	0.16129032258064516	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.0967741935483871	0.05555555555555555	2.305731052841248	2.071920123071438	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating. Also, I think it is right that more of the illigal immigrants should be worried as he directly said he is going after them which is just since they are breaking out us laws. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1915	neutral	127	0.13513513513513514	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.16216216216216217	0.24324324324324326	0.08108108108108109	0.02702702702702703	0.05405405405405406	0.05263157894736842	2.8019765249261117	2.785634044839004	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so.

492	218	I just read an article about lead levels in water. I had thought that the water crisis in Flint was just some one off incident. It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon. 	5.333333333333333	4.75	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	2	train	2001	neutral	128	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.11538461538461539	0.2692307692307692	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.0	2.7832695578021394	2.764934624878664	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 58000$.

The people who did the shooting are monsters, but that does not include all Muslims. 	6.166666666666667	2.625	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	2032	neutral	72	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.19047619047619047	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.05263157894736842	2.592589984765149	2.484603305283048	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

191	313	"What a mess immigration across the globe has become. It is such a delicate subject. Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all. In fact, Germany is in rapid negotiations with Afghanistan and other countries to repatriate those who have fled.

407	331	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed.	6.0	5.875	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	2093	hope	130	0.0	0.0	0.10526315789473684	0.15789473684210525	0.10526315789473684	0.42105263157894735	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.0	0.15789473684210525	0.043478260869565216	2.9105654631253968	2.8291657661711667	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country. I can see being so desperate in a third world country that this would seem like the police are cutting off or taking your only source of livlihood. These poor guys however they are just trying to protect and do what is right they do not deserve to be so violently attacked im suprised they were able to live through such a brutal beating.

I mean I get that they killed some bad guys too, but to me it is not worth sacrificing so many innocent lives just to kill a few bad guys.  U.S. troops were killed too.  This whole thing is just terrible and tragic in my opinion.  IT sounded like some protocol was not followed either, which makes it even worse.  I think we need to mind our own business and get out of there honestly.  We have enough issues with our own country to be over there contributing to issues in others.	3.0	1.875	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2411	disgust	102	0.2	0.12	0.0	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.24	0.2	0.12	0.0	0.0	2.794930876467427	2.717463660483334	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Not only is it terrible that adults are using these ridiculous medications, but now they are allowing their babies to get into them and harm themselves.  It's just outrageous, and they need to have stronger penalties for these people who are letting this happen.  There is simply no excuse.

I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.  Like it was preordained or something."	4.0	3.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2148	neutral/surprise	124	0.18518518518518517	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.14814814814814814	0.1111111111111111	0.14814814814814814	0.14814814814814814	0.037037037037037035	0.037037037037037035	0.0	2.3156704707421714	2.2000606054300893	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

383	23	This is a tragic story but it's also what happens in third-world countries where you pull a truck off the side of the road to sell fuel to citizens.  The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	2.333333333333333	2.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2152	anger/neutral	134	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.17857142857142858	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.21428571428571427	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch.	1.0	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2421	anger/neutral	125	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.4885225216921842	2.438170351606758	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.
