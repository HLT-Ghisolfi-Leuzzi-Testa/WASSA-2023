I hope the UN helps the people with root of the problem and helps them get jobs,food, shelter, and healthcare. I hope the European countries allow some of the people to stay to take the pressure off their home countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	6.666666666666667  	   6.625 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             1 	train 	     262 	hope/sadness     	              68 	0.0967741935483871   	0.03225806451612903  	0.0967741935483871   	0.16129032258064516  	0.0967741935483871   	0.16129032258064516  	0.12903225806451613  	0.06451612903225806  	0.03225806451612903  	0.12903225806451613  	0.14285714285714285  	3.148161767073312  	2.9142748921796895 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            304 	       347 	One of the biggest fears of a parent, is that they die and can not protect their children especially when they are young, like the children in the article.  The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	6.666666666666667  	   6.375 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     803 	hope/sadness     	              77 	0.029411764705882353 	0.0                  	0.14705882352941177  	0.11764705882352941  	0.08823529411764706  	0.23529411764705882  	0.08823529411764706  	0.08823529411764706  	0.0                  	0.20588235294117646  	0.14285714285714285  	3.312795615473694  	3.1052871674743683 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

              2 	        35 	It breaks my heart to see people living in those conditions. I hope that all the aid that was sent to the island makes it to the people who need it the most. I do not know what I would do it that was my family and I. I would hope that I would do my best, but I can see how depressing and hopeless you could feel having your whole life changed because of a storm and not knowing where your next meal is coming from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	6.833333333333333  	   6.625 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             1 	train 	       1 	hope/sadness     	              87 	0.047619047619047616 	0.047619047619047616 	0.14285714285714285  	0.09523809523809523  	0.09523809523809523  	0.19047619047619047  	0.14285714285714285  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.09523809523809523  	0.11764705882352941  	2.9345092735734495 	2.718302667868521  	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            467 	       326 	This article is ridiculous.  I'm part Jewish and all of this is absurd.  Likening our country to Nazi Germany in any way is just embarrassing.  The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?  People are stupid, even Jews, some of the smartest people in the world.                                                                                                      	1.0                	   2.5   	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             1 	train 	     466 	anger            	             124 	0.10344827586206896  	0.13793103448275862  	0.0                  	0.06896551724137931  	0.0                  	0.20689655172413793  	0.3103448275862069   	0.06896551724137931  	0.034482758620689655 	0.06896551724137931  	0.0                  	2.2894066003275304 	2.33898907419783   	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            338 	       223 	I'd bet money on the driver of the car that hit the trailer being a drunk driver. I feel like the amount of people who drive drunk - generally, but especially on holidays - is honestly alarming.

            414 	       112 	I don't really care about this at all.  I don't care about herring or abalone or whatever the diesel oil harmed.  I think it's ridiculous that the premiere of B.C., of the awful NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they did the best they could in difficult conditions.  But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.  But what can be done about any of this now other than clean it up and try not to have it happen again.  Either way I don't care.                                                                                                                                           	1.0                	   1.625 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             1 	train 	     413 	anger            	             122 	0.13333333333333333  	0.13333333333333333  	0.1                  	0.1                  	0.03333333333333333  	0.1                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.1                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.03333333333333333  	0.0                  	2.3727871896158867 	2.299989383469657  	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            203 	        31 	We must do something to stop these companies from getting rid of what forest and animals we have left. The fact that orangutans are an endagered species angers me. What have we as humans done to prevent this? I think nothing. If something is done it would be totally unimpressive and do nothing.

I do not mind conceal and carry laws, but a person using it irresponsibly such as this person should be punished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	4.5                	   3.625 	        41 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 42 	 25000 	                         5.5  	               6.0  	                    4.0  	                     4.5  	                 4.5  	                3.857  	               2.286  	     3.429  	                3.0    	             1 	train 	     223 	anger            	              57 	0.1875               	0.125                	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0                  	0.0625               	0.25                 	0.1875               	0.0625               	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.3863323778146643 	2.5476035083199937 	An essay written by a 42 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

            495 	       218 	Why isn't the EPA assessing fines for violations?   So presently you just get a violation but no repercussions.   Another example of ridiculous wasted government who sits on their behinds and doesn't do their job.   I feel every year we need a completely new group of employees in every division in the government.   It's ridiculous.

            346 	       113 	I can really get behind this ban.  It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                    	1.0                	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     845 	anger            	             111 	0.11627906976744186  	0.13953488372093023  	0.046511627906976744 	0.023255813953488372 	0.046511627906976744 	0.09302325581395349  	0.2558139534883721   	0.11627906976744186  	0.11627906976744186  	0.046511627906976744 	0.0                  	2.425378731837707  	2.480071312673714  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

              3 	        35 	I wonder why there aren't more people trying to help these people. I understand Haiti is not the richest nor less corrupt country but surely there must be a way to help. Supplies being looted by crowds is understandable because they are hungry and people need food and water to survive. We must think of other ways to distribute the food and water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	5.833333333333333  	   6.0   	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	       2 	anger            	              63 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.1                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.3                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	2.913052305343503  	2.784343104725564  	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            282 	       202 	After reading the article, my first reaction was anger. I just couldn't believe that any man would be able to take the lives of his own children. It felt really wrong and that man is very messed up in the head. I was also starting to think that maybe the man just had some sort of mental illness that was very severe.

             22 	       281 	That article is so sad. I feel so bad for her, that she wasn't able to get the help that she needed. I also feel bad for her family. I can't imagine how bad they feel and how helpless they felt seeing their family member going through something and not being able to help them. I hope that mental health services improve so that things like that don't continue to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	4.0                	   2.625 	        37 	     2 	        6 	   2 	 38 	 24000 	                         6.0  	               3.5  	                    2.5  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                5.0    	               2.143  	     3.857  	                5.0    	             1 	train 	      21 	sadness          	              71 	0.12903225806451613  	0.0967741935483871   	0.12903225806451613  	0.0967741935483871   	0.03225806451612903  	0.0967741935483871   	0.12903225806451613  	0.12903225806451613  	0.0967741935483871   	0.06451612903225806  	0.11764705882352941  	3.199372018064548  	2.956129544089312  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 24000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

             78 	       169 	Dear friend,I am writing to tell you about a horrific story and article that I have just read. A small two year old boy fell out of his bedroom window and died while his parents thought he was asleep in his room. The window was open and he pushed the screen out and fell and died shortly after. It is such a horrible story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	4.833333333333333  	   1.125 	         7 	     1 	        2 	   5 	 29 	 44000 	                         5.5  	               6.0  	                    4.5  	                     6.0  	                 5.0  	                3.714  	               3.0    	     3.429  	                3.429  	             1 	train 	      77 	sadness          	              64 	0.09523809523809523  	0.09523809523809523  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	0.047619047619047616 	0.2857142857142857   	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	3.0070702772300115 	2.9159727236159894 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 44000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

            163 	       375 	Hey, so polar bears are being killed in mass. even though they are protected, they are still being killed off. why is it that humans do this so much? We have caused so many species to go extinct, will polar bears be next? I feel like this is just what we humans do. We cause the death and destruction of other species of animals and our own planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	2.1666666666666665 	   1.875 	        46 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 34 	 68000 	                         5.5  	               6.0  	                    5.5  	                     5.0  	                 6.5  	                3.143  	               1.714  	     3.857  	                2.429  	             1 	train 	     162 	sadness          	              68 	0.08333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.283173207145076  	3.0958322388956465 	An essay written by a 34 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 68000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            370 	        80 	After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel disappointed in people and humanity. I feel bad because i read that the people in the community were killing police officers. It's terrible that police have to be viewed as a bad thing in society today when police were the ones we use to run to for help. I hope things turn out for the better for the country in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	1.0                	   1.5   	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	     369 	sadness          	              71 	0.16666666666666666  	0.11904761904761904  	0.023809523809523808 	0.11904761904761904  	0.023809523809523808 	0.16666666666666666  	0.11904761904761904  	0.11904761904761904  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.045454545454545456 	2.9962557751316368 	2.9247318669938993 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            341 	       186 	Hey A:   Did you read the article where all those children were killed on the roadway and the many injuries that took place?   Kids were in a trailer and a truck plowed into the back of them.  It was extremely disturbing to read.  I could just visualize the pain, suffering, and panic that was taking place.    I can't imagine losing 2 of your own children.  Further reading showed the driver had lost her husband.  Whoever was driving the truck will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  It's extremely sad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	7.0                	   6.0   	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             1 	train 	     340 	sadness          	              93 	0.16666666666666666  	0.05555555555555555  	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.2777777777777778   	0.2222222222222222   	0.05555555555555555  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.719704312117423  	2.6048531194072755 	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             19 	       336 	I feel bad for the elephants and the people who live next to the mines in India. I know that America used a lot of coal as it was industrializing, so it is hard for me to blame India for what they are doing to the people and animals.  It seems like the people are promised and do not get so little compensation for their lost due to the coal mines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	6.666666666666667  	   6.5   	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     518 	sadness          	              71 	0.1                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.3                  	0.2                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.029389297720072  	2.8079065923693087 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            171 	       400 	I find it sad that the little baby rhino has passed away.  Surely it lived a short life and it did not deserve a day.  Most animals seem to be very innocent creatures and it is always sad to hear of the loss of a little innocent animal life.  It also seems sad that it was at a rhino orphanage.  What happened to its parents, were they killed or did they abandon it?  Anyway, this is sad news although life does go on and it is the way of the world I guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	1.6666666666666667 	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     170 	sadness          	              93 	0.1111111111111111   	0.1111111111111111   	0.05555555555555555  	0.16666666666666666  	0.05555555555555555  	0.2222222222222222   	0.1111111111111111   	0.1111111111111111   	0.0                  	0.05555555555555555  	0.07142857142857142  	3.1599866108917123 	2.9280750923268544 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            169 	       228 	I feel bad for the girls that have to go through this because they are so poor. I hope they all the girls are returned to their families so nobody has to be hurt. It is sad that the police did not help the girls when their families asked for help. I hope that all the captors of the girls go to prison for a very very long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              	6.5                	   6.75  	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     668 	sadness          	              69 	0.14285714285714285  	0.10714285714285714  	0.14285714285714285  	0.10714285714285714  	0.07142857142857142  	0.10714285714285714  	0.10714285714285714  	0.10714285714285714  	0.03571428571428571  	0.07142857142857142  	0.2857142857142857   	3.164115661564477  	3.0106940119190067 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            269 	        47 	I really feel for this country as a whole. It is like they are getting attacked from every side. It has got to feel so on edge living in syria. You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react. You have 24 hours to leave everything you know and love and probably never see it that way again it is crazy.                                                                                                 	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             2 	train 	     768 	sadness          	             134 	0.22727272727272727  	0.13636363636363635  	0.0                  	0.045454545454545456 	0.045454545454545456 	0.045454545454545456 	0.22727272727272727  	0.13636363636363635  	0.09090909090909091  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	2.9753202676376858 	2.850512219244255  	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            285 	       202 	After reading the article , my first reaction was that i was really disturbed by what i read. I just couldn't believe that anyone would be able to kill their own children. It also made me feel really bad for the mother because i can't even imagine what i would do if this were to happen to my family. I felt bad for the children as we ll because they didn't deserve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	1.0                	   1.625 	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             2 	train 	     784 	sadness          	              73 	0.10714285714285714  	0.14285714285714285  	0.10714285714285714  	0.07142857142857142  	0.0                  	0.10714285714285714  	0.17857142857142858  	0.17857142857142858  	0.07142857142857142  	0.03571428571428571  	0.08333333333333333  	2.904986475849522  	2.7868146479093743 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            489 	       395 	Anything like what is in this article is so horrifying to me. How could a parent take the life of there child. How could a husband take the life of there wife. I can undertand people who commit sucide but to kill the whole family even the dog that is just evil. I think more help and mental reach out should be offered in communities to men. They bottle things up and this is what happens. Men are not allowed to show emotions and then they let it out in violence. I wish this woman had been able to escape sooner her and her children would still be around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             2 	train 	     988 	sadness          	             109 	0.20833333333333334  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.041666666666666664 	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.20833333333333334  	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.041666666666666664 	0.0                  	2.943237187453388  	3.005735861126108  	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

The man should be given proper mental test and all..to prevent him from harming himself or even abusing substance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	6.666666666666667  	   6.625 	        40 	     1 	        7 	   1 	 28 	165000 	                         6.25 	               5.75 	                    3.25 	                     6.75 	                 6.0  	                3.357  	               2.429  	     3.2145 	                3.4285 	             2 	train 	     625 	sadness          	              64 	0.125                	0.0                  	0.375                	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.125                	0.125                	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.8802498917612325 	2.9514520120287178 	An essay written by a 28 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            390 	        66 	After reading the article, you can't help but feel sorry for the people that were affected by the fire. It's a good thing that most only had minor injuries and there weren't any deaths though. I think that something like this is terrible because it is an accident of one person that can really hurt others as well. Hopefully people are more careful in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	1.0                	   1.75  	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	     389 	sadness          	              66 	0.19047619047619047  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.047619047619047616 	0.09523809523809523  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.047619047619047616 	0.047619047619047616 	0.08333333333333333  	2.712178415326699  	2.5283778216311563 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

             85 	       353 	I think that the article was very sad and got me worried. The fact that they coudln't find the father and his son is very sad. To think about their family members and the mother as well as what she is currently going through makes me feel awful. The father and son were both probably just trying to bond and having this happen is traumatizing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	1.0                	   1.375 	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	      84 	sadness          	              65 	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.11764705882352941  	0.23529411764705882  	0.0                  	0.058823529411764705 	0.17647058823529413  	0.17647058823529413  	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.0                  	3.0310456629694604 	2.8019586408031807 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            287 	        71 	I had no idea that people that are trying to arrest poachers are being attacked by people that live in the town. It is also so sad that the police act like cowards and do not arrest the poachers who are making certain animals extinct from the planet for selfish reasons. It's so sad that people that are trying to do the right thing are risking losing their life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	5.0                	   5.75  	        50 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 30 	 55000 	                         6.5  	               5.5  	                    2.5  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                4.0    	               3.143  	     4.0    	                4.0    	             1 	train 	     286 	sadness          	              69 	0.07692307692307693  	0.15384615384615385  	0.0                  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.07692307692307693  	0.38461538461538464  	0.15384615384615385  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9641845971504033 	2.9614263429901655 	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 55000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             31 	       386 	I just read an article about veterans and PTSD. It was really sad to learn about how many people suffer from PTSD. The article talked about how many veterans are affraid to seek help. It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it. I can only begin to imagine what our veterans are going thrugh. We owe it to the veterans to help them                    	6.5                	   1.0   	        10 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 33 	 63000 	                         7.0  	               7.0  	                    5.75 	                     6.0  	                 7.0  	                4.1425 	               1.0    	     2.0715 	                4.2145 	             2 	train 	     530 	sadness          	             153 	0.10344827586206896  	0.13793103448275862  	0.10344827586206896  	0.10344827586206896  	0.034482758620689655 	0.1724137931034483   	0.1724137931034483   	0.06896551724137931  	0.06896551724137931  	0.034482758620689655 	0.043478260869565216 	2.90387818784386   	2.712973539472296  	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 63000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

It's terrible because people were just trying to have fun at the party while these other people had other intentions like steal. I hope they get what they deserve in the long run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	1.0                	   1.625 	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             2 	train 	     829 	sadness          	              64 	0.1111111111111111   	0.16666666666666666  	0.1111111111111111   	0.05555555555555555  	0.027777777777777776 	0.1111111111111111   	0.1388888888888889   	0.1388888888888889   	0.08333333333333333  	0.05555555555555555  	0.1875               	2.7854275122928986 	2.706777944114569  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            402 	        92 	This little boy died in a well while he was helping his father harvest vegetables.  It was large enough for him to fall only one foot but too small for all the adults.  They tried to get him out for five days.  His father had to entail that severe pain knowing it was just time.   Over 500 volunteers tried to dig him out to get to the well.  Just devastating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              	6.666666666666667  	   5.0   	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             2 	train 	     901 	sadness          	              70 	0.09090909090909091  	0.045454545454545456 	0.09090909090909091  	0.18181818181818182  	0.0                  	0.09090909090909091  	0.22727272727272727  	0.13636363636363635  	0.09090909090909091  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	2.7770265215715058 	2.694509663732585  	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            257 	       174 	Wow, hearing about things like this really makes me so grateful to be an American.  I'm very happy to live in this beautiful country and I wish people would stop complaining so much about everything they think is wrong here.  Just be grateful you're not being used as a human shield.  Some of the things going on over there are just atrocious, and as bad as people think it is here it doesn't even hold a candle to that.  I am saddened to hear about these families and children being harmed so maliciously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	2.333333333333333  	   1.5   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     256 	sadness          	              93 	0.10526315789473684  	0.10526315789473684  	0.05263157894736842  	0.05263157894736842  	0.0                  	0.21052631578947367  	0.21052631578947367  	0.05263157894736842  	0.10526315789473684  	0.10526315789473684  	0.058823529411764705 	2.842991189146281  	2.7532463948031936 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            348 	       113 	Empathy is not finite. Some people would have you believe that it is, but I think that humans are capable of more than the capitalists would have you believe. I think that I'm going to stop paying attention to the news. It's become a negative force in my life and I think that I would be much happier if I didn't pay attention to American politics ever again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	5.5                	   4.375 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             1 	train 	     347 	sadness          	              68 	0.08333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	2.3297543374329392 	2.402386412890116  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

            251 	       413 	This article was sad for me.  It definitely humanized the event and focused on the father, whom I felt sympathetic towards.  I also laughed a lot at the sentence about someone wrapping bacon around the door handle of a mosque.  But I thought the portrayal of the father was very real and relatable.  I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why.  But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event.  People there, trying to survive.  People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead.  People angry.  People trying to keep the public safe.  All angles were shown.                                                                                               	5.666666666666667  	   4.25  	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     750 	sadness          	             117 	0.058823529411764705 	0.08823529411764706  	0.14705882352941177  	0.17647058823529413  	0.0                  	0.23529411764705882  	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.11764705882352941  	0.045454545454545456 	2.516347934175733  	2.230691461447019  	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

            446 	        11 	It's so sad that innocent civilians need to die because of war and fighting. These people did nothing wrong and were just minding their own business before their lives were taken away. It's not fair for the people and it's not fair for the families of the people that were killed as well. They are left without a family member and they have to live with that forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	1.3333333333333333 	   1.25  	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	     445 	sadness          	              68 	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.3333333333333333   	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.048877846422751  	2.8790101485884065 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            185 	       305 	This is a story about a 12 year old girl in Russia who killed herself after spending time online with a group that promotes suicide. I feel so badly for the family and for the girl. A group like that should not be able to operate online and influence people to harm themselves. This is just so wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	7.0                	   5.375 	        57 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 47 	110000 	                         7.0  	               6.5  	                    4.5  	                     5.5  	                 7.0  	                5.0    	               2.143  	     3.571  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     684 	sadness          	              58 	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.4166666666666667   	0.16666666666666666  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9325149548792484 	2.936662131886812  	An essay written by a 47 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 110000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            382 	        23 	I feel really bad for the people that were involved in this accident. It was so terrible and so many lives were lost because of something so unexpected happening.

             10 	       213 	That's sad.  Regardless of what they find out happened, who was controlling what or if they had drugs in their system or whatever, it's sad.  I don't know that they will find out anything, i just feel like lots of people will turn this into something it's not.  It's unfortunate anytime a young person like this, with the world at their fingertips, loses their life in something that was controllable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	1.6666666666666667 	   1.125 	        49 	     1 	        5 	   1 	 31 	 82000 	                         3.5  	               2.5  	                    2.0  	                     4.5  	                 5.0  	                3.571  	               2.286  	     1.857  	                2.0    	             1 	train 	       9 	sadness          	              70 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	2.5106473581670667 	2.413261945881569  	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 82000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            297 	       339 	The article did not give much information about where the refugees were from.  I had to google to learn they were mainly from Syria.  I thought this was very sad, although it is one of those problems without an easy solution.  Who is supposed to be paying for these people to be cared for?  Taxes?  Whose taxes?  I don't see a simple fix here.  It's easy to sit there and judge and say this is unfair, but also what is everyone supposed to do?  AT least they are being given asylum from the dangerous place they came from I guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	2.6666666666666665 	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     296 	sadness          	             100 	0.15384615384615385  	0.07692307692307693  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.07692307692307693  	0.23076923076923078  	0.23076923076923078  	0.07692307692307693  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.6752173067585363 	2.443637681047076  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            268 	        47 	The whole article broke my heart. If I got a text message telling me I have 24 hours to leave my home and all the things that I own, I would not know what to do. Of course I would leave with my wife and children because they are the most important things in my life, but it would be hard to know my house is about to get bombed. Also, paying 40 dollars for a kilogram of meat, I could not afford this and I do not live in a war tore country. I hate this for the people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	6.833333333333333  	   6.625 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     767 	sadness          	             100 	0.14285714285714285  	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	0.047619047619047616 	0.09523809523809523  	0.09523809523809523  	0.2857142857142857   	0.19047619047619047  	0.09523809523809523  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.8076429798639464 	2.6726193292736924 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             81 	       353 	I found this very sad.  I feel very sad for the mother and other family members who might be left behind.  It just sounds like such a tragedy that surely was very unexpected.  I'm sure the entire family who was remaining was left feeling shocked and totally heartbroken at a double loss.  The mother lost a husband and son and any other family members like children would have lost a brother and their dad.  The whole thing is just terrible really.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	2.0                	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     580 	sadness          	              81 	0.10204081632653061  	0.061224489795918366 	0.08163265306122448  	0.10204081632653061  	0.04081632653061224  	0.12244897959183673  	0.1836734693877551   	0.16326530612244897  	0.04081632653061224  	0.10204081632653061  	0.05555555555555555  	2.9815859976993475 	2.7733218878026724 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            246 	       177 	Eh I don't have strong feelings about this.  I'm sorry about the passing of a person and sorry for their family's loss, but I disagreed strongly with her political positions.  So I can't say I'm especially sad or sorrowful for her.  I am sorry just in a general sense because the loss of a life is always a sad thing and I'm sad for the family members who were left behind to grieve her loss.  So those things make me feel sad and empathetic but otherwise I Feel neutral about this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	1.0                	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     745 	sadness          	              91 	0.17391304347826086  	0.13043478260869565  	0.043478260869565216 	0.08695652173913043  	0.0                  	0.13043478260869565  	0.21739130434782608  	0.21739130434782608  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.6913367463727718 	2.409844473082889  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            252 	       413 	Its always sad when these tragedies occur. We must cohesively find ways to improve this and lessen the chances these attacks occur. I just wonder what we can do though. We have to be able to make a positive change and to be honest the only way to do that is to have stricter laws. These laws would mean less freedom but I am okay with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	5.833333333333333  	   5.375 	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             2 	train 	     751 	sadness          	              67 	0.11764705882352941  	0.058823529411764705 	0.11764705882352941  	0.17647058823529413  	0.0                  	0.17647058823529413  	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.17647058823529413  	0.125                	2.829245926419545  	2.7561406487158373 	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             69 	       138 	This is such a sad story. To think these girls have been driven to take their own lives because of bullying is appalling. Why can't we seem to do more to stop this behavior and why do kids and even adults feel that bullying behavior is acceptable. We have to start punishing kids for this behavior, make them be accountable for their actions and take a strong stand that says we won't tolerate this kind of behavior any longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	5.5                	   6.75  	        44 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 46 	 22000 	                         6.5  	               5.5  	                    2.5  	                     5.0  	                 5.0  	                3.286  	               2.286  	     4.857  	                4.714  	             1 	train 	      68 	sadness          	              79 	0.11764705882352941  	0.11764705882352941  	0.058823529411764705 	0.11764705882352941  	0.0                  	0.17647058823529413  	0.17647058823529413  	0.11764705882352941  	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.0                  	2.872166465650943  	3.1352033465928204 	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            390 	        66 	I feel so sad that this freak fire has effected so many people. It has ruined the owners property which has got to be a big financial loss. It also has displaced so many people who have lived here. They have lost everyhting in the fire and i cant imagine having to rebuild or having the money to replace all my stuff and stuff thats irreplacable like pictures. I feel grateful that people were hurt and no one was killed it could have been way worse.

I just wish it could be prevented in some ways. May God give the parents the fortitude to bear the lose. ANd may he also provide another kid for them immediately. There should be ways by which the parents can be consoled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	6.333333333333333  	   6.25  	        40 	     1 	        7 	   1 	 28 	165000 	                         6.25 	               5.75 	                    3.25 	                     6.75 	                 6.0  	                3.357  	               2.429  	     3.2145 	                3.4285 	             2 	train 	     673 	sadness          	              68 	0.13636363636363635  	0.13636363636363635  	0.045454545454545456 	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.13636363636363635  	0.13636363636363635  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	2.8118218316964834 	2.713817751850383  	An essay written by a 28 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            333 	       148 	I feel that this article is really disturbing because i feel so bad for the elephant. I feel that elephant are such gentle animals and people just take advantage of that. Elephants are one of the sweetest animals in the world and wouldn't hurt a fly. The fact that people are using elephants for entertainment and just taking them away from their families is really disturbing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	1.0                	   2.25  	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             2 	train 	     832 	sadness          	              66 	0.125                	0.125                	0.0625               	0.125                	0.0625               	0.125                	0.125                	0.125                	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0                  	3.2302218738129302 	3.2200996579311547 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            358 	        44 	I think it is very sad. I think many people are turning to suicide because they are desperate. They are depressed and can't take it anymore. It is an awful place to be in. The family was well known but that does not keep them safe from the depression or despair that can hit anyone at any time. You should look out for one another. It is a very tough world out there. It is very easy to slip into a depression.

            360 	        44 	That's awful, I feel that Oklahoma City might not be as safe as I thought. After 9/11 they raised security around airplanes a lot, but it hasn't been perfect. They probably can never get it perfect. I guess it wasn't terrorism exactly though? Just a regular murder. That's just awful either way.

            341 	       186 	The politics behind this whole situation were a bit confusing to me, but it was clear that overall it is a really bad situation over there.  It mentioned several times that multiple people were brutally raped and even murdered, sometimes by government officials, and this is really distressing and sad.  That is obviously something that should never happen to anyone, so it makes me sad to hear that these people suffered like that.  I think clearly something needs to be done over there but I'm not sure what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	1.3333333333333333 	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     840 	sadness          	              88 	0.25                 	0.25                 	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.7589625481766666 	2.7592402911433704 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

We are already harming the earth and it's inhabitants already by polluting the air but this just adds on to it. I really hope we can come to a day where we will be able to help animals instead of harming them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	1.0                	   1.625 	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             2 	train 	     910 	sadness          	              69 	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.18181818181818182  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.09090909090909091  	0.1111111111111111   	3.1842278864561964 	3.0900429487676173 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            428 	       397 	This sounds like one of those situations where not much can really be done.  It's sad for the animals who are dying and suffering and I feel bad for them.  I think this is out of anyone's control and really just an act of nature.  Sometimes thiings like this just happen and it's sad and a tragedy but no one can do anything to fix it.  The animals are the ones that suffer.  They are in essence having a drought and starving due to it which is really sad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              	1.6666666666666667 	   1.125 	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     427 	sadness          	              89 	0.19047619047619047  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.3333333333333333   	0.19047619047619047  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.8849310643783848 	2.7873927700407215 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            190 	       299 	This is pretty sad for the birds.  I find the amount of plastic in the ocean in general to be alarming, and it's always terrible to see it affecting wildlife.  It is vvery unfair to them really.  It would be like someone coming in and just polluting your house with their trash and there was nothing you could do about it and it started making you sickk.  I think we need to do something about the plastic issue, maybe starting by cutting down on all the plastic we use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	1.8333333333333333 	   1.25  	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     689 	sadness          	              89 	0.1111111111111111   	0.1111111111111111   	0.07407407407407407  	0.07407407407407407  	0.037037037037037035 	0.07407407407407407  	0.18518518518518517  	0.14814814814814814  	0.14814814814814814  	0.037037037037037035 	0.06666666666666667  	2.911653225527878  	2.7785514452149287 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            192 	       313 	The article I just read was very sad, it is terrible how people that are in trouble in their countries cannot leave because of the country that they are from. It doesn't matter to Germany whether or not they will get killed if they get sent back and these people shouldn't be turned away by Germany.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	4.166666666666667  	   5.875 	        50 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 30 	 55000 	                         6.5  	               5.5  	                    2.5  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                4.0    	               3.143  	     4.0    	                4.0    	             2 	train 	     691 	sadness          	              56 	0.125                	0.125                	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.125                	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.25                 	0.125                	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.7812834030370768 	2.6862068335680274 	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 55000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

            147 	       147 	I feel so terrible. These are totally avoidable situations and yet we keep losing live to it. Wild fire are dangerous and not only cause damage to properties globally, they also affect wild animals and lead to extinction of rare species. Men are also killed as a result.

            421 	       133 	Wow this is unbelievable, who on earth would do something like this to a harmless flamingo for no reason?  This guy is obviously depraved and has serious issues.

More needs to be done to test these roller coasters to make sure that it does not happen anymore. Unfortunately it happens too often more than it should and we do not hold these park authorities accountable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	5.833333333333333  	   6.125 	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	      72 	sadness          	              57 	0.17647058823529413  	0.058823529411764705 	0.11764705882352941  	0.058823529411764705 	0.0                  	0.11764705882352941  	0.17647058823529413  	0.17647058823529413  	0.058823529411764705 	0.058823529411764705 	0.1111111111111111   	3.0139909064557897 	2.957483821905844  	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            307 	        48 	This article was just heartbreaking. I just pictured my father working his whole life for us just for a warm and horrible people to come in and tear it down. It is pure hell for everyone living in this war torn area I cant imagine. No older people who worked there life so there familys can be better should be worried about war and losing the family. The doctors have even fled as there is no resources to help people anymore. Only once dialysis center left which will probably close soon for fear of people and lack of resources. Anyone with a chronic disease is just out of luck as medicine is few and aid cant even be reached to most of these people anymore. It is just so sad.                                                                                                             	6.0                	   5.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             1 	train 	     306 	sadness          	             130 	0.14893617021276595  	0.10638297872340426  	0.02127659574468085  	0.0851063829787234   	0.02127659574468085  	0.1276595744680851   	0.23404255319148937  	0.1276595744680851   	0.06382978723404255  	0.06382978723404255  	0.03225806451612903  	3.0670110952378695 	2.8592069020793054 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             89 	       304 	It is some what saddening that suicide rates among young children have increased, but not surprising. I believe there is a correlation with the increased prevalence of social media and the rise in this kind of phenomena. Social media use is correlated with mental illnesses such as depression, which in turn are linked to suicides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	3.0                	   1.0   	        35 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 33 	 64000 	                         6.5  	               7.0  	                    3.5  	                     4.5  	                 7.0  	                3.714  	               1.0    	     2.429  	                1.429  	             1 	train 	      88 	sadness          	              55 	0.07142857142857142  	0.07142857142857142  	0.07142857142857142  	0.07142857142857142  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	2.790524438081479  	2.7119862781503703 	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

            149 	       147 	The fires that killed more than 100,000 people just disappoint me honestly. I feel like overall there has to be a better way to go about things this is just depressing and we need to find better ways to help them out. I feel like there needs to be people held accountable for this just leaving it like this is not going to cut it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	6.666666666666667  	   6.0   	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	     148 	sadness          	              65 	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.2222222222222222   	0.2222222222222222   	0.2222222222222222   	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.926887405254446  	2.890296349008849  	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            371 	       367 	I think that after reading the article, it just confirms my views on war and terrorism. It has been going on for way too long and it really needs to come to an end. Innocent people are dying as well as getting killed. Families of these people are all grieving that they just lost a family member. Overall, it's terrible that this is still going on in the world today and there's nothing we can do about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	1.0                	   1.5   	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             2 	train 	     870 	sadness          	              78 	0.19047619047619047  	0.14285714285714285  	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.047619047619047616 	0.23809523809523808  	0.19047619047619047  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.075209032338521  	2.8558480455540454 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            317 	        39 	This article really struck home for me. I am so sad that this wolf traveled 700 miles to find a new mate just to be killed sensesly. He traveled through rough conditions like a jill field and stillended up dying. I think thes eprograms by the government to kill animals is horrifying. We should all live together in hamony. If they are a pest we should find ways that dont harm them like relocating the animals to help the problem not kill innocent souls.Someday they will find a solution that wont harm lives and live in peace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             2 	train 	     816 	sadness          	              97 	0.23684210526315788  	0.05263157894736842  	0.05263157894736842  	0.07894736842105263  	0.0                  	0.10526315789473684  	0.23684210526315788  	0.13157894736842105  	0.07894736842105263  	0.02631578947368421  	0.0                  	3.0188541768942163 	2.8638008886888193 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

They are under constant fear of attack. There are roadblocks so they can't get food in or get out to get food. The prices of goods that are within the area have also risen drastically. I can't imagine having to live in this type of situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	6.0                	   1.375 	        57 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 47 	110000 	                         7.0  	               6.5  	                    4.5  	                     5.5  	                 7.0  	                5.0    	               2.143  	     3.571  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     867 	sadness          	              69 	0.19047619047619047  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.23809523809523808  	0.19047619047619047  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.09523809523809523  	0.0                  	2.7670403218584902 	2.609429053986996  	An essay written by a 47 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 110000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

            242 	        19 	I feel bad for all the people that have to leave their home country to try to find a better life.

             36 	        58 	While we do think about the human suffering caused by war and poverty, we rarely consider the effects these have on animals. It just makes these situations all the more heartbreaking. When I think about animals in zoos - animals that have been removed from their native lands, only to starve to death. I'm suprised more animal rights groups haven't become involved - really, if all those angry vegans out there spent more time helping animals and less time pontificating to the rest of us, they would do far more good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	5.666666666666667  	   2.625 	        27 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 46 	 41000 	                         4.5  	               7.0  	                    3.0  	                     6.0  	                 1.0  	                4.286  	               2.857  	     4.857  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     535 	sadness          	              91 	0.13333333333333333  	0.1                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.03333333333333333  	0.06666666666666667  	0.06666666666666667  	0.2                  	0.1                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.03333333333333333  	0.0                  	3.073896685657707  	2.910046720197979  	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 41000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

            202 	        31 	I think this is sad for the orangutangs.  It seems unfair that their environment is being destroyed.  This whole peat forest issue seems like an environmental problem.  I don't see the need to deforest anyway.  That just seems destructive to me for no reason at all.  It seems like it is best when we just leave the environment alone and stop tampering with things and intervening.  IT always seems to have harmful consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	1.1666666666666667 	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     701 	sadness          	              73 	0.16666666666666666  	0.16666666666666666  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.041666666666666664 	0.041666666666666664 	0.25                 	0.20833333333333334  	0.125                	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.4343703095116607 	2.3833655191000025 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            389 	        66 	I think when accidents like this happen we must sit back and wonder why they happened and what can be done to prevent them in the future. I feel like this Arizona apartment complex probably did not have the necessary protocols to do things the right way and that caused this to happen. We must ensure all buildings have the necessary steps to prevent this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	6.5                	   6.0   	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	     388 	neutral          	              65 	0.5                  	0.0                  	0.5                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9840614327573602 	2.9662722621159827 	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             50 	       210 	When tragedies like the one in Paris happen we must dig down deep and look for proper solutions. I think we need to research what goes through people's heads when they commit crimes like this.It was a little racist for one of them to say muslim security collaborated with the criminals. That was a bad thing to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	5.666666666666667  	   6.0   	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             2 	train 	     549 	neutral          	              58 	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.73717430813238   	2.8616187708654093 	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

I have known a few people that had to deal with a situation like this and I feel that a lot of people just kind of go to pieces when they get diagnosed.

It is sad that rather than curbing it, it has escalated it too much. Kids now getting depressed. I wonder why kids of nowadays are softer though.

             64 	       150 	I just read a news article about a plane crash that killed China's forst woman to fly a J-1o fighter. That sounds like a horrible way to die. I am scared of planes for that very reason. There is nothing you can do about it. She was the very first of four woment to fly the J-10 fighter jet. The J-10 is a single engine fighter jet. She was very proud of herself for being the first woman to fly in the fighter jet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	5.833333333333333  	   2.25  	        10 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 33 	 63000 	                         7.0  	               7.0  	                    5.75 	                     6.0  	                 7.0  	                4.1425 	               1.0    	     2.0715 	                4.2145 	             2 	train 	     563 	neutral          	              84 	0.1875               	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.125                	0.1875               	0.125                	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.06666666666666667  	2.7762095270102582 	2.4695115412542736 	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 63000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

I could not imagine not having access to clean water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	5.166666666666667  	   3.375 	         7 	     1 	        2 	   5 	 29 	 44000 	                         5.5  	               6.0  	                    4.5  	                     6.0  	                 5.0  	                3.714  	               3.0    	     3.429  	                3.429  	             2 	train 	     992 	neutral          	              39 	0.0                  	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.2                  	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	2.668936821435053  	2.5007355331989016 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 44000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

             14 	        78 	I just read an article about a few siblings who went through the foster system in Kentucky and all ended up in prison for different reasons. Eventually, one of them went on to attain a masters degree and work with people who have to deal with similar circumstances. Unfortunately, I think this story is all too common with children who go through the foster system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	4.5                	   2.375 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             2 	train 	     513 	neutral          	              65 	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.25                 	0.08333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.08333333333333333  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.07692307692307693  	2.837899881073376  	2.6208510051747447 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

But it said that over thirty civilians and 15 police had been killed, which is never good news. Plus so many people were without food and housing.

            371 	       367 	This isn't the first time it seems like the US has backed what looks to be a group of terrorists.

            402 	        92 	I just read a story about a Chinese boy who went missing and five days later was found dead at the bottom of a well.

            110 	       134 	This was pretty sad.  It is easy to take for granted the fact that we have clean and safe water to drink and bathe with on a daily basis.  These people were struggling and didn't even have that noe basic thing.  I can't imagine living somewhere where I didn't feel like I had clean and safe water.  I don't drink the tap water here but I know I can buy it in a store and drink that safely.  It sounded like these people didn't even have that option and it was totally unfair to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	1.5                	   1.125 	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     609 	neutral          	              95 	0.0                  	0.038461538461538464 	0.11538461538461539  	0.23076923076923078  	0.0                  	0.3076923076923077   	0.038461538461538464 	0.038461538461538464 	0.038461538461538464 	0.19230769230769232  	0.038461538461538464 	2.7168291888976404 	2.4451755028017375 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            395 	       270 	I really doubt the credibility of anything China says.   They are always out for money, workers are in jobs that aren't save, people have no decisions made on their own.  It's a communist country where the government rules.   Living conditions are terrible and I don't believe the branch of government that is responsible for safe working conditions do anything.   It's all just chatter for the rest of the world to rread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	3.0                	   5.5   	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             2 	train 	     894 	neutral          	              71 	0.125                	0.0625               	0.03125              	0.1875               	0.03125              	0.21875              	0.15625              	0.0625               	0.03125              	0.09375              	0.0                  	2.4441708161246707 	2.4009489593991886 	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

            334 	       148 	For the past few years I have been struggling about the ideas of zoos. I know that they are educational, but I think to myself about how the animals feel. I believe that elephants are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. To keep one in isolation is pure cruelty. I have seen elephants cry over the lost of loved ones and they are very communal animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	6.666666666666667  	   6.5   	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     833 	neutral          	              69 	0.06666666666666667  	0.06666666666666667  	0.0                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.26666666666666666  	0.26666666666666666  	0.06666666666666667  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9791528837514254 	2.9094611841965983 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            118 	         9 	I just read about a tremendous earthquake that happened in New Zealand a few years back. There were only two deaths but the amount of damage to infrastructure was crippling. Do places that fequently deal with natural disasters like this have some kind of insurance or initiative that helps pay for damages? The estimated cost was said to be in the billions.

I hope she did not suffer, but it is clear that she did not want to live an that was her choice to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	3.0                	   1.0   	        35 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 33 	 64000 	                         6.5  	               7.0  	                    3.5  	                     4.5  	                 7.0  	                3.714  	               1.0    	     2.429  	                1.429  	             2 	train 	     520 	neutral          	              66 	0.05555555555555555  	0.05555555555555555  	0.16666666666666666  	0.16666666666666666  	0.05555555555555555  	0.2222222222222222   	0.1111111111111111   	0.05555555555555555  	0.0                  	0.1111111111111111   	0.2                  	2.7758543083797416 	2.5646554928230985 	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it. I think what Germany needs is to overhaul their immigration laws and make a change down the middle where asylum is fair but realistic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	1.6666666666666667 	   5.0   	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	     194 	neutral          	              65 	0.42857142857142855  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.2857142857142857   	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.746839353067087  	2.588865446699511  	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses low empathy and high distress levels.

             66 	       138 	I feel like bullying is not something new and the fact that we still have not done anything about it is repulsive.

I wish it wasn't so easy for me to believe that the proprietors of the zoo blamed the deaths of animals and horrible conditions on armed conflict that their country primarily instigated. The zoo wasn't even targeted in attacks on the area. I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place, but it is nice to know that there are groups out there to look out for the best interest of these poor animals."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	5.333333333333333  	   4.375 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             1 	train 	      98 	neutral          	              95 	0.16666666666666666  	0.16666666666666666  	0.05555555555555555  	0.05555555555555555  	0.05555555555555555  	0.16666666666666666  	0.16666666666666666  	0.05555555555555555  	0.05555555555555555  	0.05555555555555555  	0.0625               	2.9037809076066723 	2.732233433449975  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

People need the US help in many areas and the money for bomb could be spent better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	5.833333333333333  	   6.75  	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     610 	neutral          	              69 	0.13333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.03333333333333333  	0.06666666666666667  	0.1                  	0.06666666666666667  	0.23333333333333334  	0.13333333333333333  	0.03333333333333333  	0.03333333333333333  	0.0                  	2.77001132063873   	2.647867406464604  	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            490 	       395 	So, I just read a story about a family in which the husband and wife were going through domestic strife and the husband ended up murdering everyone and then killing himself. According to the article he attempted to put a band-aid on deeply rooted relationship issues by taking the family to Disney Land. Who thinks like that? Honestly, I can see taking any available route when desperate, but if your wife wants to leave you she is going to leave you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	5.5                	   1.875 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             1 	train 	     489 	neutral          	              81 	0.06666666666666667  	0.13333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.06666666666666667  	0.13333333333333333  	0.06666666666666667  	0.3333333333333333   	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.813382783157359  	2.7571828507063625 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

            191 	       313 	It's terrible that so many people all around the world seem to want to flee their home countries rather than do more to make them better. I understand fearing death and economy troubles but if everyone just left those countries the ones they flee to will just have similar problems. I can understand how Germany doesn't want to just accept anyone and yet at the same time can feel sorry for those that have legit claims and are just turned away because of where they are from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	3.8333333333333335 	   2.0   	        44 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 46 	 22000 	                         6.5  	               5.5  	                    2.5  	                     5.0  	                 5.0  	                3.286  	               2.286  	     4.857  	                4.714  	             1 	train 	     190 	neutral          	              87 	0.25                 	0.1                  	0.1                  	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.1                  	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9194530286933555 	2.8532990033751497 	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

            171 	       400 	I suppose this is about an orphaned rhino due to poaching.  I had a hard time really feeling that much for the rhino.  It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.  I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way.                                                                                                                                                  	2.1666666666666665 	   1.25  	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     670 	neutral          	             124 	0.14285714285714285  	0.05714285714285714  	0.08571428571428572  	0.05714285714285714  	0.05714285714285714  	0.11428571428571428  	0.2                  	0.17142857142857143  	0.08571428571428572  	0.02857142857142857  	0.058823529411764705 	2.5391010619924437 	2.3531190403933007 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

             76 	       169 	I am not really sure how I feel about this article. I kind of think that parents in this situation should face some type of consequences. Not always jail time but community service or being forced to partake in educational classes so as to avoid these situations in the future. As hard as it is to say this, the parents are at fault as this is a clear case of negligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	4.166666666666667  	   3.375 	         2 	     1 	        2 	   1 	 30 	 30000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    4.0  	                     4.0  	                 5.5  	                4.0    	               1.571  	     4.0    	                3.857  	             1 	train 	      75 	neutral          	              71 	0.18181818181818182  	0.0                  	0.045454545454545456 	0.13636363636363635  	0.0                  	0.18181818181818182  	0.2727272727272727   	0.13636363636363635  	0.0                  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	2.8177740780060314 	2.766608250572887  	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

            288 	        71 	This one is hard for me to think about. I can see both sides of this one. One, the two anti poachers are trying to save the animals, which I think is a good thing. The other people are trying to make a living in a harsh environment and the rest of the world is based on capitalism where resources are used to make as much money as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	1.8333333333333333 	   5.625 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             1 	train 	     287 	neutral          	              69 	0.0                  	0.05555555555555555  	0.1111111111111111   	0.2222222222222222   	0.1111111111111111   	0.2777777777777778   	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.2222222222222222   	0.09090909090909091  	2.8740279209227784 	2.7902723096677153 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses low empathy and high distress levels.

            322 	        52 	I am not sure how I feel about this.  This guy is a lifelong criminal and honestly I don't think people like that deserve citizenship.  His parents messed up when he was young, yes, but he could have taken the responsibility to fix that as an adult.  He should have looked into it instead of spending so much time and energy breaking the law.  So I think he deserves what he is getting and should have been more careful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	1.0                	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     321 	neutral          	              79 	0.06666666666666667  	0.13333333333333333  	0.2                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.06666666666666667  	0.2                  	0.06666666666666667  	0.0                  	0.06666666666666667  	0.06666666666666667  	0.1                  	2.6510598964530194 	2.727617590879149  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            272 	       146 	I'm sorry for the hate crimes happening against Muslims and others, but to blame this on Trump is absurd.  It's more of the left wing media trying to pin things on him.  There have been hate crimes going on for a long time, and even the article said they were at the same level they were in 2015 before he was even elected.  I would blame social media and the way people spread information now.  Plus a general anger that has entered society and people feel it is acceptable to take it out in violence against others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	1.0                	   1.0   	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             1 	train 	     271 	neutral          	              97 	0.0967741935483871   	0.1935483870967742   	0.06451612903225806  	0.06451612903225806  	0.0                  	0.12903225806451613  	0.22580645161290322  	0.0967741935483871   	0.12903225806451613  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.636150426481091  	2.7105149452196113 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

             22 	       281 	Depression is a major factor in all of our lives. I believe that everybody gets depressed it is that some of us are better with dealing with it. She took her own life after being a very successfully person. It shows me that money,worth and fame do not matter when it comes to depression. It is sad that she did not get the help she needed in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	6.833333333333333  	   5.125 	        30 	     1 	        6 	   3 	 37 	 40000 	                         7.0  	               5.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.0    	     3.429  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     521 	neutral          	              68 	0.0625               	0.125                	0.125                	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.25                 	0.125                	0.125                	0.0                  	0.0625               	0.0                  	3.066151583715488  	2.8217163936627556 	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            158 	       302 	Air pollution is bad, so bad that it kills thousands of people each year. In India alone according to a Washington Post article published last month, about half a million people die every year due to outdoor air pollution. With that introductory paragraph, here?s a finding of a new study that may not surprise a lot of you readers: people with lung cancer may have shorter survival times when exposed to smog and other air pollutants. With the above information it is vital to pay attention to people with lung cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	5.0                	   2.0   	         5 	     2 	        6 	   3 	 22 	100000 	                         5.5  	               4.5  	                    3.5  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                3.714  	               2.857  	     2.571  	                3.429  	             1 	train 	     157 	neutral          	              91 	0.15                 	0.1                  	0.025                	0.025                	0.025                	0.15                 	0.2                  	0.125                	0.15                 	0.05                 	0.0                  	2.9632599008735854 	2.8397708029468274 	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

            452 	       182 	I just read an article about a kitten that had been brutally bound and left to die on the side of the road in Washington.

            363 	       163 	I believe that the photographer that happened to describe the life of Insha hit the nail on the head with this description of the life of her after the blindness.

The fact that the female pilot was hit by another aircraft implies that protocols wwere not correctly observed though. The other plane should not have been close enough to hit her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              	4.333333333333333  	   2.625 	         2 	     1 	        2 	   1 	 30 	 30000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    4.0  	                     4.0  	                 5.5  	                4.0    	               1.571  	     4.0    	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     561 	neutral          	              63 	0.0                  	0.25                 	0.08333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.0                  	0.16666666666666666  	0.25                 	0.0                  	0.08333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.482200013953995  	2.531580241696076  	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

            236 	       245 	Just saw this news story about an old lady who was confusingly wandering without proper clothes late at night and and thought I would share it with you. As we move well into our 30's, the cruelness of old age seems to be becoming clearer and clearer. Maybe there were other reasons for her state but my immediate reaction was that it was due to age related general loss of senses and awareness. May we help those of us who need help in such state and may our old age be free from such sad endings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	4.833333333333333  	   3.125 	        28 	     1 	        6 	   5 	 34 	 36000 	                         6.0  	               3.5  	                    2.0  	                     7.0  	                 6.0  	                4.857  	               2.571  	     2.143  	                4.571  	             2 	train 	     735 	neutral          	              96 	0.06666666666666667  	0.06666666666666667  	0.13333333333333333  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.13333333333333333  	0.0                  	0.06666666666666667  	0.0                  	2.937824835477736  	2.6891284486675224 	An essay written by a 34 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 36000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

             37 	        58 	I find the article comical.  In these places, people are starving to death and the concern of some people is whether zoo animals are getting enough to eat.  The zoo animals should be slaughtered to feed people.  The horses slaughtered to feed to animals should be fed to people.  The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.  That's my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	1.1666666666666667 	   3.875 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             1 	train 	      36 	neutral          	              90 	0.15789473684210525  	0.15789473684210525  	0.05263157894736842  	0.0                  	0.05263157894736842  	0.05263157894736842  	0.2631578947368421   	0.10526315789473684  	0.15789473684210525  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.8902417163807037 	2.8822890277425324 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and medium distress levels.

            162 	       375 	People visit a region and all they after is how to maim and deplete the population of an endangered specie. How wicked can human be. It is sad and totally unacceptable.

I think that there should definitely be some sort of punishment for people who decide to kill animals, especially endangered species of animals just for fun. I think it is so inhumane and twisted that someone can kill a beautiful animal like that with no type of remorse whatsoever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	1.0                	   2.5   	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	     317 	disgust/sadness  	              67 	0.18518518518518517  	0.07407407407407407  	0.037037037037037035 	0.037037037037037035 	0.0                  	0.14814814814814814  	0.2222222222222222   	0.14814814814814814  	0.07407407407407407  	0.07407407407407407  	0.0                  	3.0121636072714715 	2.9557370591618906 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            202 	        31 	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?                                                                                   	1.5                	   3.5   	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             1 	train 	     201 	disgust/sadness  	             128 	0.06896551724137931  	0.06896551724137931  	0.10344827586206896  	0.13793103448275862  	0.10344827586206896  	0.1724137931034483   	0.10344827586206896  	0.10344827586206896  	0.06896551724137931  	0.06896551724137931  	0.09090909090909091  	2.611000319206454  	2.4650590113548265 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and medium distress levels.

             18 	       336 	I find it disturbing that thousands of acres of forest land are destroyed to mining, foraging elephants attracted by the crops in the fields often enter villages, resulting in an alarmingly high number of human-elephant conflict situations. This shouldnt be. This is wrong. I mean the selfishness of some people shouldnt be a problem for all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	6.666666666666667  	   6.25  	        40 	     1 	        7 	   1 	 28 	165000 	                         6.25 	               5.75 	                    3.25 	                     6.75 	                 6.0  	                3.357  	               2.429  	     3.2145 	                3.4285 	             1 	train 	      17 	anger/disgust    	              56 	0.21428571428571427  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.07142857142857142  	0.35714285714285715  	0.21428571428571427  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.706612875151823  	2.568214763555867  	An essay written by a 28 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            262 	        34 	"I think that placing blame does little to help in situation like those in the middle east. It seems like everyone is doing their best and those that are at odds keep any positive progress from being made. What are people to do?

            206 	       201 	This type of situation really makes my blood boil.  Who do these people think they are, going out in the streets and looting like a bunch of wild animals in order to protest?  The guy was shot!  He was a clear threat to the officers and had PCP in his car.  This is ridiculous.  The officer felt he had to protect himself.  What gives people the right to then go out and loot and act like a bunch of wild animals and get more people killed in response?  How on earth is that a mature response to the situation?  I'm so disgusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	1.0                	   1.25  	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     705 	anger/disgust    	             102 	0.09523809523809523  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.047619047619047616 	0.14285714285714285  	0.09523809523809523  	0.3333333333333333   	0.047619047619047616 	0.09523809523809523  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.840740075258231  	2.7836343869098066 	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

            113 	        45 	I definitely think that something needs to be done about these airstrikes. Too many people are losing their lives and too many people are dying. It's not even just the people that are in the war but people that are innocent are affected as well. This goes for children and little babies.

            342 	       186 	This angers me to know stuff like this still goes on in 2019. The fact that another country has to help another with troops shows that we aren't in better times like some people say. Kenya  deported an official knowing he was most likely to die when he arrived back in Sudan. This is cold blooded and Kenya should be ashamed of themselves for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	5.5                	   5.875 	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             2 	train 	     841 	anger/disgust    	              65 	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.0                  	0.1                  	0.3                  	0.2                  	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.6460127662549917 	2.6656115992850618 	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             17 	       336 	The government of India makes a lot of money from coal production, but they do not take into account who this is affecting the most. Both the people and the elephants are being hit the hardest, not to mention the forests that are being destroyed. There have been 75 deaths of people and 30 deaths of elephants. People are having respiratory problems. Just imagine the children being affected. It's a travesty. People need clean air and water to live and it's like the government doesn't care. Someone needs to step up and do something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	7.0                	   7.0   	        18 	     1 	        5 	   1 	 40 	 25000 	                         7.0  	               7.0  	                    7.0  	                     7.0  	                 7.0  	                5.0    	               1.429  	     4.857  	                4.857  	             2 	train 	     516 	anger/disgust    	              94 	0.15384615384615385  	0.11538461538461539  	0.07692307692307693  	0.11538461538461539  	0.038461538461538464 	0.11538461538461539  	0.19230769230769232  	0.07692307692307693  	0.038461538461538464 	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	2.900952639947513  	2.8283044371745487 	An essay written by a 40 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            145 	        94 	Reading about this insane war zone and killings was so graphic and made me so sad. I think so much more needs to be done to defeat ISIS they are like the black plague spreading in the middle east. They hate america and destroy innocent lives I just dont know how you could kill so many people and not feel bad. They are killing people and show casing them in the streets it is hard to understand how in this day and age groups can do that it reminds me of the nazis during the holocaust I fear if this is not taen care of soon it will spread to other areas liek the us with more terroristic events happening.                                                                                                                                                                                      	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             1 	train 	     144 	fear/sadness     	             120 	0.225                	0.15                 	0.0                  	0.05                 	0.0                  	0.025                	0.275                	0.175                	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.067301986416784  	2.9690699244306376 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            286 	        71 	I feel really bad for the rangers, who were just doing their job and were treated unmercifully by the villagers.  And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.                                                                                                      	5.333333333333333  	   5.875 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     785 	fear/sadness     	             118 	0.15384615384615385  	0.11538461538461539  	0.0                  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.23076923076923078  	0.19230769230769232  	0.15384615384615385  	0.07692307692307693  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.8106067462790105 	2.6044920664133167 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            200 	       398 	I think its really sad we need to do something these animals are precious and do not deserve to be killed off not only unknowingly but also so scary.

             61 	       150 	I think it's always tragic when someone dies, but when that someone is a milestone type person it's even worse. How wonderful to be the first Chinese woman to be a fighter pilot and then how tragic to be killed in such a way.

            407 	       331 	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed.                                                                           	6.0                	   5.875 	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             1 	train 	     406 	hope             	             130 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.10526315789473684  	0.15789473684210525  	0.10526315789473684  	0.42105263157894735  	0.05263157894736842  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.15789473684210525  	0.043478260869565216 	2.9105654631253968 	2.8291657661711667 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            379 	        91 	This article was troubling on so many different levels. I cant put myself in this girls shoes because I would never imagine my parents doing this to me. I cant believe they are out of jail they seem like such a threat to society if they can do this to there own child. I pray these people never come in contact with a never child again. you are suppose to protect your kids. This girl can never get her childhood back i dont see how you could trust people after this or live a normal life my mind would be so messed up. i hope she gets the help she needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             1 	train 	     378 	hope             	             111 	0.10714285714285714  	0.03571428571428571  	0.14285714285714285  	0.10714285714285714  	0.07142857142857142  	0.25                 	0.07142857142857142  	0.03571428571428571  	0.0                  	0.17857142857142858  	0.1                  	3.038533936441102  	2.9969787736933937 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            333 	       148 	This article just hits you right in the gut. Especially because it deals with animals. Animals are so helpless when at the hand of there human handlers. This is so unfair to this gentle giant. Treated to badly just to perform and make money. she is livign a horrible confined life of solitude. It is greatly disturbing that the givernment has the power to stop this yet has turned a blind eye. They need to take action and be an advocate for this poor animal. She deserves way better treatment then what she is getting now. How does anyone condone this or go to shows where this animal is chaned and obviously in pain and discomfort.                                                                                                                                                             	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             1 	train 	     332 	disgust          	             116 	0.14285714285714285  	0.11428571428571428  	0.02857142857142857  	0.05714285714285714  	0.02857142857142857  	0.08571428571428572  	0.22857142857142856  	0.17142857142857143  	0.11428571428571428  	0.02857142857142857  	0.0                  	2.997361029335136  	3.0194647955736036 	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            408 	       331 	This is a topic that never seems to get any better for women.   Pay inequality has dropped to 45 for the United States.  This is an embarrassing statistic.   Fewer women are in the workforce and fewer women hold prestigious jobs.   The misuse of women's education and value is so disheartening.  US Stem Skills professions are not in a good place. Scandinavian countries hold the top 4 spots.  The disparity in salaries is what it was in 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	6.0                	   6.875 	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             2 	train 	     907 	disgust          	              77 	0.05                 	0.1                  	0.1                  	0.1                  	0.05                 	0.1                  	0.25                 	0.15                 	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.2                  	2.4487617105066164 	2.3819408644807303 	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            141 	        94 	Part of me feels sympathy for these people and the terror they're experiencing.  And yet part of me thinks that it's a problem of their own making.  These people are sheep.  Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.  Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side.  Why, thousands and thousands of years later, can these people still not create stable cultures?                                                       	2.833333333333333  	   3.625 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     640 	disgust          	             123 	0.125                	0.075                	0.075                	0.1                  	0.0                  	0.2                  	0.2                  	0.075                	0.05                 	0.1                  	0.045454545454545456 	2.929916103698265  	2.8228907262980045 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and medium distress levels.

            370 	        80 	An article like this just make you so glad to live in the united states. Where everything is regulated and we have laws. I can not imagine living in a place where the governemnt and law can do anything they please without consequences. Soldiers raping women burning down houses all with out real cause. Any aid workers and doctors are treated very poorly so theres not enough to go around how does this civilzation survive. Crazy how far behind and uncivilized some places still are in 2019. I think more light needs to be shown on this as real people are hurting. Everyone deserves to feel safe in there country.                                                                                                                                                                                 	6.0                	   6.0   	        53 	     2 	        3 	   1 	 27 	 25000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    6.0  	                     6.0  	                 6.0  	                4.0    	               2.286  	     3.571  	                3.714  	             2 	train 	     869 	disgust          	             110 	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.25                 	0.0                  	0.35                 	0.1                  	0.05                 	0.0                  	0.1                  	0.05555555555555555  	2.906815934243272  	2.755954966599335  	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            377 	        91 	So, I just read an article about an episode of Dr. Phil that features a young woman who was groomed and sexually abused by both of her parents because of a potential windfall from selling child pornography. I have a hard time wrapping my head around men who abuse their children for sexual gratification, but the fact that her mother was involved in this too makes it almost too horrible to be true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	6.833333333333333  	   5.875 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             1 	train 	     376 	disgust          	              73 	0.06666666666666667  	0.06666666666666667  	0.13333333333333333  	0.1                  	0.03333333333333333  	0.16666666666666666  	0.13333333333333333  	0.06666666666666667  	0.1                  	0.13333333333333333  	0.0                  	2.689726384356501  	2.722513977238416  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            257 	       174 	Reading about the tactics used by the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria is like being transported back in time. They are destroying resources just to maintain a hold on their positions including using people as human shields. They must be aware that this is a fight they can not win, so instead of giving up they are razing people and cities to the ground. The whole thing is disgusting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	6.0                	   5.125 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             2 	train 	     756 	disgust          	              70 	0.2                  	0.15                 	0.05                 	0.15                 	0.0                  	0.15                 	0.15                 	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.05                 	0.0                  	2.8930561709927507 	2.8091293848876377 	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            198 	       398 	So sad about all the birds that die in wind turbines. It seems that every move you make, every footstep is to the detriment of something else, even if you're trying to do something good. It's so sad how violent and chaotic and painful life is. You can't walk without out killing a bug under your feet, every step is death. It makes it all so so worthless sometimes.

I think this is so sad and is part of a larger problem of opioid addiction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	7.0                	   4.625 	        57 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 47 	110000 	                         7.0  	               6.5  	                    4.5  	                     5.5  	                 7.0  	                5.0    	               2.143  	     3.571  	                5.0    	             1 	train 	     417 	neutral/sadness  	              60 	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.2857142857142857   	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	3.1495963303284835 	3.006992373053358  	An essay written by a 47 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 110000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

            221 	       417 	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either. 	4.0                	   3.25  	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     720 	neutral/sadness  	             147 	0.19047619047619047  	0.047619047619047616 	0.047619047619047616 	0.047619047619047616 	0.0                  	0.09523809523809523  	0.3333333333333333   	0.23809523809523808  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.6784079571859336 	2.673278459415617  	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

Second, I find it interesting that 2007 is when young suicides spike.  That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.  Like it was preordained or something."                                                                        	4.0                	   3.375 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             1 	train 	      89 	neutral/surprise 	             124 	0.18518518518518517  	0.07407407407407407  	0.07407407407407407  	0.037037037037037035 	0.14814814814814814  	0.1111111111111111   	0.14814814814814814  	0.14814814814814814  	0.037037037037037035 	0.037037037037037035 	0.0                  	2.3156704707421714 	2.2000606054300893 	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

            353 	       116 	Hey A:  Did you read the article on cholera in third world countries?  I'll focus on the Haiti piece of the article.   Haiti had an overwhelming number of folks that had cholera.   Vaccines were offered to the government because there was little they could do for those folks other than IVs.   The government refused to take help from the World Health Organization.   The corruption that goes on that country never ceases to amaze me.   I got extremely frustrated reading what could have been done but nothing was done.   So many people died that should not have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	7.0                	   5.5   	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             2 	train 	     852 	anger/neutral    	              96 	0.18181818181818182  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.045454545454545456 	0.13636363636363635  	0.3181818181818182   	0.13636363636363635  	0.13636363636363635  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.5526287464045216 	2.4245958118565976 	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

             33 	       386 	PTSD is something I personally know because I have friends with it. It is no joke and really makes people feel vulnerable.

             73 	         3 	It makes me mad they the did not shut the ride down and really figure out what was wrong with it. I feel bad for all of those who lost their lives that day.

            399 	       368 	I just finished reading the UW-Madison article.  This guy named Alec Cook is being charged in alleged attacks on 5 women.   It was a gruesome article how he forced these women to have sex with him or drugged and raped them despite the women pleading no.   Stories like this really affect everyone.  It's quite horrendous to think this happens so much in our culture.   His legal team has a great deal to disprove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	4.666666666666667  	   5.5   	         8 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 62 	 29000 	                         6.5  	               2.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.5  	                 2.0  	                3.571  	               4.0    	     2.143  	                4.429  	             1 	train 	     398 	anger/sadness    	              73 	0.05263157894736842  	0.0                  	0.10526315789473684  	0.21052631578947367  	0.05263157894736842  	0.2631578947368421   	0.10526315789473684  	0.05263157894736842  	0.05263157894736842  	0.10526315789473684  	0.08333333333333333  	2.7240578957463235 	2.6951288088666967 	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

            291 	       242 	I hate hearing about American troop deaths.  I feel sad for the Captain and First Sergeant who died.  Those are experienced and high-ranking people.  I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.  And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death.                                                                                                                                    	4.166666666666667  	   5.125 	        48 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 41 	 28000 	                         2.5  	               2.0  	                    1.5  	                     2.0  	                 1.0  	                3.286  	               4.429  	     2.714  	                2.571  	             2 	train 	     790 	anger/sadness    	             115 	0.2                  	0.14                 	0.04                 	0.06                 	0.02                 	0.08                 	0.2                  	0.14                 	0.08                 	0.04                 	0.0                  	2.3879661194222765 	2.220323323534724  	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

            259 	       174 	This is a horrific story. It is about islamic militants capturing villagers and using them as human shields. The villagers didn't have much, if any, of a choice to go with them. They also killed most of the police and army so the villagers had no one to protect them. It is absolutely horrifying for these people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	7.0                	   6.5   	        57 	     2 	        6 	   1 	 47 	110000 	                         7.0  	               6.5  	                    4.5  	                     5.5  	                 7.0  	                5.0    	               2.143  	     3.571  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     758 	fear             	              57 	0.21428571428571427  	0.07142857142857142  	0.0                  	0.07142857142857142  	0.0                  	0.21428571428571427  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.6592667033765363 	2.6346003289564908 	An essay written by a 47 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 110000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

The air stroke that struck the wrong area and accidentlally hit a hospital killing dozens really seems sketchy. There is no regard for human life and that is truly scary. We never hear about this in the new and it is just a normal occurrence there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	6.333333333333333  	   5.0   	        16 	     2 	        5 	   1 	 28 	 50000 	                         6.0  	               6.0  	                    5.0  	                     4.5  	                 3.5  	                5.0    	               4.143  	     4.857  	                5.0    	             2 	train 	     932 	fear             	              64 	0.18181818181818182  	0.13636363636363635  	0.045454545454545456 	0.09090909090909091  	0.0                  	0.045454545454545456 	0.2727272727272727   	0.18181818181818182  	0.045454545454545456 	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.9963306285278035 	2.901226334420166  	An essay written by a 28 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            273 	       146 	these hate crimes have been rising lately and i feel it is due to more than just terrorists. These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this. The fact that we haven't fixed things yet is quite scary and we need to do the right thing and take steps to clean up the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	6.0                	   6.25  	        19 	     1 	        6 	   2 	 32 	 35000 	                         5.5  	               5.0  	                    2.0  	                     5.5  	                 4.5  	                3.429  	               2.857  	     2.857  	                2.714  	             1 	train 	     272 	fear/neutral     	              76 	0.14285714285714285  	0.09523809523809523  	0.047619047619047616 	0.14285714285714285  	0.0                  	0.09523809523809523  	0.14285714285714285  	0.14285714285714285  	0.09523809523809523  	0.09523809523809523  	0.0                  	2.859611613962261  	3.003268596999805  	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            430 	       397 	After reading the article, i felt really alarmed and worried about wildlife heading into the future. I think that more and more species of animals will start to die out and go extinct because of lack of water as well as food. Hopefully the future generation could figure something out to combat this because if it continues down this path, Earth will end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	1.0                	   1.625 	        17 	     1 	        6 	   1 	 29 	 85000 	                         6.75 	               6.75 	                    6.75 	                     6.75 	                 7.0  	                4.643  	               2.0715 	     4.143  	                4.643  	             1 	train 	     429 	fear/hope        	              63 	0.125                	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0625               	0.0                  	0.125                	0.3125               	0.1875               	0.0                  	0.0625               	0.0                  	2.865682996401917  	2.804873561602851  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

I don't understand how people can sleep at night after persecuting people in unfortunate circumstances like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	6.333333333333333  	   5.625 	        25 	     1 	        4 	   1 	 29 	 39000 	                         6.0  	               6.5  	                    1.0  	                     6.0  	                 5.5  	                5.0    	               2.286  	     3.286  	                4.143  	             2 	train 	     821 	disgust/neutral  	              67 	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.5                  	0.5                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	0.0                  	2.7406909859245903 	2.603962409309341  	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

            288 	        71 	I found this story quite distressing.  It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers.  But I guess they support poaching in that area?  Perhaps it is important to their economy?  Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.  Really, what is wrong with people?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	1.0                	   2.25  	        24 	     2 	        7 	   1 	 38 	 42000 	                         7.0  	               3.5  	                    6.5  	                     5.5  	                 6.5  	                3.429  	               2.714  	     2.571  	                3.857  	             2 	train 	     787 	disgust/surprise 	              83 	0.16216216216216217  	0.1891891891891892   	0.0                  	0.08108108108108109  	0.08108108108108109  	0.10810810810810811  	0.21621621621621623  	0.05405405405405406  	0.08108108108108109  	0.02702702702702703  	0.0                  	2.889257168148965  	2.726688923696076  	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.
