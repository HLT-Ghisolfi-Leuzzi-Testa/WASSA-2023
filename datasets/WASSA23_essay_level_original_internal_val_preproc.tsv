It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace	1.0	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	47	hope/sadness	68	0.09375	0.09375	0.125	0.125	0.03125	0.15625	0.15625	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	2.9450640727934734	2.8877504120511595	An essay written by a 23 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation.	1.5	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	929	hope/sadness	93	0.15625	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	0.125	0.0625	0.09375	0.125	2.9210526611324372	2.8826445785555053	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

207	201	I'm so tired of all this violence. If a cop shoots someone suddenly it's acceptable to go around and commit violence or loot and steal. We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	4.833333333333333	7.0	44	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	2	train	706	anger	93	0.1956521739130435	0.15217391304347827	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.06521739130434782	0.06521739130434782	0.21739130434782608	0.10869565217391304	0.021739130434782608	0.0	0.0	2.746293485206892	2.898086076746432	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

You don't do that unless you don't want to win.  You fight ugly and you fight hard.  We didn't win World War 2 by playing nice.  We nuked Japan twice.  We leveled Germany.  Civilians are targets, too.  These Yemeni allowed a rebel group backed by iran to take over and are now causing threats to Saudi Arabia.

222	417	In this case I totally support the actions of the man who shot the dog.  He was totally within his rights and it was highly inappropriate and inconsiderate of that woman to have an unleashed dog running int he park.  The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.

346	113	I can really get behind this ban.  It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.

Unfortunately it happens too often more than it should and we do not hold these park authorities accountable. 	5.833333333333333	6.125	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	72	sadness	57	0.17647058823529413	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.17647058823529413	0.17647058823529413	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.1111111111111111	3.0139909064557897	2.957483821905844	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

385	23	Wow, how sad.  So many people dead for no reason.  This sounds just like a terrible accident to me, I mean they think it could have been caused by lightning striking?  What are the odds?  It's so sad when things like this happen that result in such a massive loss of life.  I feel bad for all the families affected and plus of course all the victims who lost their lives due to something so unnecessary.  Sometimes things like this just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it I guess.	2.5	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	384	sadness	93	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.10344827586206896	0.0	0.10344827586206896	0.06896551724137931	0.1724137931034483	0.1724137931034483	0.06896551724137931	0.0	0.0	2.823700867052452	2.717904469750892	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

398	368	This is kinda sad, although it's good that they caught this guy before he did any further damage.  IT is sad for the women he already assaulted though.  He is clearly some sort of serial rapist and needs to be put where he cannot harm any more women because he has already harmed too many.  This type of thing is always sad because the victims can't undo the harm that's already been done to them.

This is 2019 and there's no reason why a woman should need a male escort to do anything.  That sounds ridiculous to me as an American woman.  I feel sad for the women living in these nations.

I do not want anybody to kill themselves, but if you feel that way take your own life and let other people live theirs. 	6.666666666666667	5.0	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	780	sadness	62	0.26666666666666666	0.0	0.06666666666666667	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.26666666666666666	0.2	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.0	2.9662866118438775	2.963201860984464	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

I can't even imagine what those soldiers have to go through, and I hope that my loved ones never find out. I think it's understandable that adjusting back would be difficult. I really think we need to do better taking care of our troops... even in the beginning. Do we really need them? Are we putting their interests at heart, or just our political ones?	6.333333333333333	5.75	45	2	6	1	31	34999	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	1	train	30	sadness	85	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.14285714285714285	2.7648446518608316	2.6197079766845524	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 34999$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

It makes me feel like doing something to help them out.	1.0	1.0	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	80	sadness	69	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	2.7829703368700116	2.664663253774611	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

132	73	As sad as i feel for Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie, it doesn't really bother me too much. The main reason being that they are already filthy rich. I do feel bad for the children though. Not really knowing who your father is and being taken care of by only a single mother can be very tough.

118	9	I just read about a tremendous earthquake that happened in New Zealand a few years back. There were only two deaths but the amount of damage to infrastructure was crippling. Do places that fequently deal with natural disasters like this have some kind of insurance or initiative that helps pay for damages? The estimated cost was said to be in the billions.

374	367	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	1.8333333333333333	1.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	873	neutral	138	0.1702127659574468	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.1276595744680851	0.2553191489361702	0.10638297872340426	0.06382978723404255	0.02127659574468085	0.047619047619047616	2.5914474085383152	2.4718460691420208	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

248	177	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	2.333333333333333	1.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	247	neutral	122	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.06451612903225806	0.1935483870967742	0.16129032258064516	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.0967741935483871	0.05555555555555555	2.305731052841248	2.071920123071438	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened.  Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings.  I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted.  If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected.

195	313	This is something that is hard to choose sides with.  When people seek asylum its fine to want to help. At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it. I think what Germany needs is to overhaul their immigration laws and make a change down the middle where asylum is fair but realistic.	1.6666666666666667	5.0	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	194	neutral	65	0.42857142857142855	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.746839353067087	2.588865446699511	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses low empathy and high distress levels.

I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate their works cited to the various other work they are completing in ways to document not only their feelings on the article, but also progress on their goals as a person regarding their personalized information they receive. However, we as mTurk workers are afforded the luxury, and in fact the article more relates to the fact that remote workers are sometimes shut off from communication to the outside world by regular means. This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

I think the internet is becoming something that guardians need to at least passively monitor to see what's going on in their children's heads.	5.666666666666667	5.25	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	184	neutral	71	0.19047619047619047	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.19047619047619047	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.047619047619047616	0.0	2.595939917918661	2.6266915630995396	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

Not only in France but all around the world kids suffer from this and it leads to many suicides.

It makes me not want to travel by train, even though I now these types of events are rare.

476	53	This article is very interesting to me. I think alot of consumers have a lack of education when it comes to food, food safety, labeling, and disposal. If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	975	neutral	130	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.027777777777777776	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.027777777777777776	0.1111111111111111	0.16666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

202	31	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	1.5	3.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	201	disgust/sadness	128	0.06896551724137931	0.06896551724137931	0.10344827586206896	0.13793103448275862	0.10344827586206896	0.1724137931034483	0.10344827586206896	0.10344827586206896	0.06896551724137931	0.06896551724137931	0.09090909090909091	2.611000319206454	2.4650590113548265	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and medium distress levels.

However, I also feel that the people of the region are complicit in their own suffering.  If you allow this type of disease to build, you suffer the consequences.  They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.  Other nations fought their oppressors, internal or external, and weren't just passive.

Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

221	417	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	4.0	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	720	neutral/sadness	147	0.19047619047619047	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.3333333333333333	0.23809523809523808	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch.	1.0	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	123	anger/neutral	125	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.4885225216921842	2.438170351606758	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

111	45	This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	1.3333333333333333	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	110	anger/neutral	134	0.1951219512195122	0.12195121951219512	0.024390243902439025	0.07317073170731707	0.0	0.17073170731707318	0.2682926829268293	0.07317073170731707	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

353	116	This is just crazy that people are still dying today when there is medicine that can easily save there lives. There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	352	anger/sadness	144	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.06521739130434782	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.10869565217391304	0.1956521739130435	0.13043478260869565	0.08695652173913043	0.021739130434782608	0.04	2.8031151719709975	2.8067926541500885	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

And so I felt sad reading this, thinking about the loss this father felt, and all the terrible emotions he would have experienced from the beginning of the even to, well, his death, probably.  And the terror of the people at the concert.  And the anger of the people afterwards who committed harassment and whatnot against Muslims.  All of the emotions I felt and was chagrined by.
