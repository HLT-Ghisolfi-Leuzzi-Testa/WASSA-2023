374	367	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	1.8333333333333333	1.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	873	Neutral	138	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.25	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0	2.5751833632443666	2.417981998527935	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.

Her mom wraps scarves around her face and eyes to protect her.  :)   I have a great deal of admiration for her as she is speaking the the journalist about what happened.   She wants her government to give her an answer.  She had aspirations of becoming a doctor.   She showed her textbooks to him.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.

On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

313	291	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.
