437	308	This article really brings you back down to earth. It shows everything in science is not correct and there is still much for us to learn. It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1593	hope/sadness	136	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.24	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.05263157894736842	2.9615192213757	2.7765868181672064	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need.	6.666666666666667	6.375	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	1586	hope/sadness	77	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.14705882352941177	0.11764705882352941	0.08823529411764706	0.23529411764705882	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.0	0.20588235294117646	0.14285714285714285	3.312795615473694	3.1052871674743683	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

231	128	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.	2.0	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	1631	anger	137	0.15384615384615385	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.4230769230769231	0.19230769230769232	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.0	2.3201376604620663	2.411814748980693	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	1.1666666666666667	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	1643	anger	126	0.10869565217391304	0.06521739130434782	0.08695652173913043	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.10869565217391304	0.043478260869565216	0.06521739130434782	0.034482758620689655	2.715918480761497	2.6570584722038997	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

467	326	This article is ridiculous.  I'm part Jewish and all of this is absurd.  Likening our country to Nazi Germany in any way is just embarrassing.  The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?

It disgusts me to see people smoking at playgrounds, and I've literally had to leave before because people were blowing smoke everywhere and I didn't want my children breathing it.  It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me.  I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.  These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence.

I cannot imagine what the parents are going through after losing a child in such a manner.	6.5	4.625	10	1	6	3	33	63000	7.0	7.0	5.75	6.0	7.0	4.1425	1.0	2.0715	4.2145	2	train	1751	sadness	89	0.10810810810810811	0.13513513513513514	0.05405405405405406	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.02702702702702703	0.2702702702702703	0.1891891891891892	0.16216216216216217	0.02702702702702703	0.0	3.0683838120340488	3.0513471351517496	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 63000$.

283	202	This is a highly disturbing story.  How could this man feel the need to harm his own children?  If we wanted to take his own life, fine, but why the children?  It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story.  But either way, I find it very sad for the kids who lost their lives for no reason.  And what about the rest of the family?  Where was the mother in this story?  How grieved she must be.  The whole thing was very very sad.	3.6666666666666665	2.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	1761	sadness	100	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.0	2.7226945954945023	2.6575860804544407	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

I just think things like this happen too often where people get swept under the rug and professionals and others overlook what should really be treated as major warning signs.

It seems like every day or so there is some lunatic out there with a gun killing people for no apparent reason except for their own instability or anger at the world.  This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.

I think that I'm going to stop paying attention to the news. It's become a negative force in my life and I think that I would be much happier if I didn't pay attention to American politics ever again. 	5.5	4.375	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	1731	sadness	68	0.08333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.25	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.3297543374329392	2.402386412890116	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.

It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance.

Later the same day, when her mother turns up at the school, there is no sign of her daughter. No-one has seen her.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""

The mother and sister have to live and rebuild there life without the kids and husband. How do you even go on after such a thing. There needs to be more aid and relief and stop all the bombing and violence. It is such a silly way to die over nothing. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2318	sadness	83	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.2647058823529412	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.0	3.271854790109057	3.0850171952986485	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

It is vvery unfair to them really.  It would be like someone coming in and just polluting your house with their trash and there was nothing you could do about it and it started making you sickk.

You don't now who to trust not even your government. Innocent people and children are being killed so violently and senselessly. I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared.

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction.

For that I really feel like she should be honored and I hope people close to her find peace after all of this loss.	6.0	6.0	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	1918	neutral	58	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.19047619047619047	0.19047619047619047	0.047619047619047616	0.23809523809523808	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.16666666666666666	2.5009768164400934	2.46655513212326	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.

261	34	People are suffering in the middle east. I wonder if there will ever be peace over there. I feel like the war is never ending. It just keeps going and going.

30	171	I just read an article about the persecution of the different religious groups in Mosul due to the advance of ISIL and the violence between them and the U.S. backed Iraqi government. It's crazy to think about people's entire lives being destroyed; their homes, businesses, churches every place with any kind of significance is leveled and they have no reason to stay. I honestly don't know why the government is encouraging them to come back. There's nothing to come back to.	5.0	3.875	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	1929	neutral	81	0.23333333333333334	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.1	0.2	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.0	2.6514034154224975	2.5283379847431284	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

228	139	I just read an article about ranavirus that affects amphibians in the United Kingdom.

It mentioned that one should not refrain from building garden ponds, but instead refrain from transferring material from said ponds? The whole article kind of missed the mark, I think.	2.0	2.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	1962	neutral	71	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.29411764705882354	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.07142857142857142	2.6840490760758917	2.488720331928068	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

463	18	I think anytime somebody dies because of gunfire it is terrible. This case in particular is interesting because the deaths happened at some security units.

225	417	After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.	1.1666666666666667	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2005	neutral	115	0.22857142857142856	0.14285714285714285	0.02857142857142857	0.05714285714285714	0.02857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.753786559096828	2.800814964553498	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

124	6	I just read an article about MSF putting on simulated refugee experiences across the US. I understand their objective, but I can certainly see this as being a tedious and forced experience. You simply can't simulate the urgency and suffering that refugees have to go through. Your family isn't being rent in twain, your wife isn't being raped and your children aren't being sold into slavery. I know they have the purest intentions, but this just seems silly to me. The people who are attending these events already consider themselves empathetic; they aren't changing any minds with this kind of display.	3.8333333333333335	3.125	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2009	neutral	101	0.16666666666666666	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.20833333333333334	0.125	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.5958681529622116	2.555087853926407	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

182	305	I just read an article about suicides in Russia. Apparently, there are online communities devoted to encouraging teenagers to take their own lives.

The people who did the shooting are monsters, but that does not include all Muslims. 	6.166666666666667	2.625	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	2032	neutral	72	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.19047619047619047	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.05263157894736842	2.592589984765149	2.484603305283048	medium	low	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

199	398	Hye buddy, I just read an article that you might find interesting. Apparently, wind turbines that companies use for power generation kill a lot of birds every year. But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless. It seems that no matter how much we try to protect the environment, our effect on it is always worse than we imagine.	4.666666666666667	1.5	51	1	7	5	41	64000	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.571	2.143	3.429	3.714	2	train	1887	neutral	92	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.25	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.0	2.9211927933062913	2.8101045912106017	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000$.

200	398	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1983	neutral	119	0.10526315789473684	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.21052631578947367	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.15789473684210525	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason.

But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.	3.1666666666666665	4.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2398	anger/disgust	134	0.20588235294117646	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.029411764705882353	0.4117647058823529	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	2.553277780366228	2.4901476129719273	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

It sounds like a precursor to serial killer behavior, honestly, because who does something like that except an extremely depraved person?	4.166666666666667	4.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	2071	anger/disgust	85	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.71245319918745	2.984059352818415	low	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	1.0	2.625	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2110	disgust	136	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.35294117647058826	0.17647058823529413	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I have a hard time wrapping my head around men who abuse their children for sexual gratification, but the fact that her mother was involved in this too makes it almost too horrible to be true. 	6.833333333333333	5.875	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	2413	disgust	73	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.13333333333333333	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.1	0.13333333333333333	0.0	2.689726384356501	2.722513977238416	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

148	147	A smog outbreak in Southeast Asia last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths, according to a new study released Monday that triggered calls for action to tackle the ?killer haze?. Researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities in the US estimated there were more than 90,000 early deaths in Indonesia in areas closest to haze-belching fires, and several thousand more in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. I feel so sad at the thought of this haze killing thousands of people.	5.0	2.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	2145	neutral/sadness	80	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.23529411764705882	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.739052671266264	2.6091325039596773	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

221	417	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	4.0	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2135	neutral/sadness	147	0.19047619047619047	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.3333333333333333	0.23809523809523808	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

71	3	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.	4.0	3.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	2147	neutral/sadness	133	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.12903225806451613	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.0	2.674559314803139	2.6434111615432863	medium	medium	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

216	247	This one sort of gets to me.  The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.  Awful to live with.	5.833333333333333	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2416	neutral/sadness	143	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.19230769230769232	0.19230769230769232	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.0	2.6821772746555674	2.552187431598643	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

You can't turn individual problems into global problems, and global problems into individual problems.  It's just too much.  I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.  These people need to fix their own countries, not use civilized people as a crutch.	1.0	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2421	anger/neutral	125	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.0	2.4885225216921842	2.438170351606758	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

383	23	This is a tragic story but it's also what happens in third-world countries where you pull a truck off the side of the road to sell fuel to citizens.  The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	2.333333333333333	2.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2152	anger/neutral	134	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.17857142857142858	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.21428571428571427	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

That's not to say we should necessarily do that, or that we necessarily get anything truly valuable out of doing that, but it's the reality.  And so I felt sad reading this, thinking about the loss this father felt, and all the terrible emotions he would have experienced from the beginning of the even to, well, his death, probably.  And the terror of the people at the concert.  And the anger of the people afterwards who committed harassment and whatnot against Muslims.  All of the emotions I felt and was chagrined by.

235	128	I think it is disgusting men in such high power positions use it to just attack women like this. They think they can just get away with it and there actions have no consequences. So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this.

I can't imagine living somewhere where you constantly  had to fear being bombed or shot or some catastrophe like that that caused imminent death or bodily harm.  It would just be so stressful and difficult to have to live like that.  I get worried about things like getting sick but jeez this just takes it to an all new level.  It makes me very grateful to live where I am instead of somewhere like that.  	1.8333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2189	joy/sadness	103	0.1891891891891892	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.05405405405405406	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.21621621621621623	0.13513513513513514	0.10810810810810811	0.0	0.0	2.73761614943349	2.685517286487593	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.
