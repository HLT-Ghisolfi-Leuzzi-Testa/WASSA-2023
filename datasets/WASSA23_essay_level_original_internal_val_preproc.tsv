24	281	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	1594	hope/sadness	130	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.25	0.05	0.05	0.058823529411764705	2.921270175908798	2.719409547178719	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 58000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

These are a drop in the bucket and most people go about their lives without meaningful harassment.  And I'm never going to tell people not to be furious when Islamic terrorism kills Americans.  Islam is complicit with that.  Many Muslims harbor those feelings even if they don't fully support them.  And way too few Muslims speak or work to stamp out Islamic terrorism, here or abroad.  We are all fighting wars whether we recognize it or not.  There is no ""us""; that is a false notion.

207	201	I'm so tired of all this violence. If a cop shoots someone suddenly it's acceptable to go around and commit violence or loot and steal. We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect. It's time we start fairly representing both sides of a situation.	4.833333333333333	7.0	44	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	2	train	1616	anger	93	0.1956521739130435	0.15217391304347827	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.06521739130434782	0.06521739130434782	0.21739130434782608	0.10869565217391304	0.021739130434782608	0.0	0.0	2.746293485206892	2.898086076746432	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 22000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

There was nothing they could have really done and they definiteyl did not deserve this. The fact that there are little children with no food or water really hurts me. There are most likely animals out there that are in need of food and water as well.	1.0	1.5	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	2	train	1680	sadness	75	0.07692307692307693	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.19230769230769232	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.19230769230769232	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.08333333333333333	2.9776835550314584	2.832778520401678	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

63	150	Its quite sad when crashes like these happen and when they do happen I can't help but feel like something could have been done to prevent it. I feel like as humans we do not do enough to try and prevent all of these crashes. The fact that it was a routine training flight with the aerobatics team makes it worse. IT was also the first woman to fly a China j_10 fighter.	4.833333333333333	5.75	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	2	train	1662	sadness	73	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6969181191471563	2.552468533935266	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

251	413	To me this was very sad to read.  These parents lost their child and many other people lost loved ones in this senseless attack.  It just seems like it's gotten unsafe to go anywhere public these days with large crowds.  The situation is obviously out of hand in France and it is bad in the United States too.  Everywhere really.  I don't trust the terrorists or Muslims and there are many other problematic groups as well.  The problem is with humanity and it is very sad.  	3.333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	1746	sadness	86	0.15625	0.09375	0.0625	0.0625	0.03125	0.09375	0.21875	0.15625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.7546590942666374	2.625389778591462	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

Kids were in a trailer and a truck plowed into the back of them.  It was extremely disturbing to read.  I could just visualize the pain, suffering, and panic that was taking place.    I can't imagine losing 2 of your own children.  Further reading showed the driver had lost her husband.  Whoever was driving the truck will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  It's extremely sad.	7.0	6.0	8	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	1	train	1810	sadness	93	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.2222222222222222	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.719704312117423	2.6048531194072755	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

27	171	I am writing as regards my thoughts on Christians from Mosul, brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed, in some cases, by neighbors, and nothing ? not the priest?s pleas, not his invocation of Cain and Abel ? seemed likely to heal those scars. Khalid Ramzi, a congregant, seemed to choke on the sermon. I was so sad by this event and i hope something urgent is being done as soon as possible so that this will not happen anymore.	4.0	2.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	2	train	1860	sadness	80	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.1111111111111111	2.5477984638520867	2.3629721099447814	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

345	186	This article was a little hard to follow as I dont follow or know much about whats going on in the other side of the world. It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance.

Yes they are evil and need to be punished but thinking of what lead them to try and kill innocent people they must have had something horrible in there life happen or been in a very toxic enviroment. There should be more talks of mental health and treatment for people instead of banning guns. There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns. This was also odd because he was older 70 years old,and hispanic I wonder if the tension and state of the US made him angered and want to carry out this act.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2294	sadness	128	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.06896551724137931	0.034482758620689655	0.0	0.13793103448275862	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.13793103448275862	0.0	0.0	2.93117078039479	2.8825443750586928	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1796	sadness	142	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.02631578947368421	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.10526315789473684	0.21052631578947367	0.15789473684210525	0.10526315789473684	0.02631578947368421	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.9229281816107426	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.  She might be scared and confused too.	3.8333333333333335	3.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	1789	sadness	124	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.3181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.5966982380845147	2.610244049344368	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

56	72	I find it sad that elephants are still being poached and killed just for their tusks.  Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made.  I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade.  Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?  I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.  	1.8333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	1795	sadness	101	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.2727272727272727	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.5756634401649334	2.451092105291401	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2017	neutral	131	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.2	0.23333333333333334	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.043478260869565216	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

We truly live in a twisted reality.	3.8333333333333335	2.625	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	2359	neutral	61	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	3.0077190720889786	2.853970748500062	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

470	326	Another article about politics slamming one side or the other.   The article refers to America has to heal.   The only way it can heal is people have to quit thinking about me, me, me, and look out for the nation and others.   It seems it just comes down to what vitriol will be posted to some social media site.  People are numb to all of it yet all the national media continues to support one side or the other and not see it as what it is.  	1.0	2.5	8	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	2	train	1914	neutral	87	0.0	0.1	0.0	0.3	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	2.7627858649514514	2.6116218622326772	An essay written by a 62 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 29000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

On the other hand, I remember reading about how they gave the pipeline an x amount chance of spilling into the water, and it was relatively low.  I just don't know who I support here.  I don't think people should be burning cars, and blocking roads, but I don't really have an alternative plan either.	1.0	1.125	49	1	5	1	31	82000	3.5	2.5	2.0	4.5	5.0	3.571	2.286	1.857	2.0	1	train	1960	neutral	78	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.58642036448891	2.4545231836457515	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 82000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

364	163	I feel some amount of sympathy for this girl because I can't imagine what it would be like to lose your eyesight like that.  In one brief moment the world goes from visible to invisible in an instant.  It's got to be nearly traumatic (although she seems to be remaining upbeat).  But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened.  Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings.  I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted.  If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected.  If she wasn't part of the unrest, then she should have fled the area.	2.833333333333333	1.75	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	1920	neutral	145	0.18421052631578946	0.10526315789473684	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.07894736842105263	0.15789473684210525	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.04	2.61566603327308	2.5278560164688244	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

But still, the thought of losing all your family like that is harsh.  And the people who killed them are dead.  I'm not sure if that's better or worse.  No place to direct your anger and despair.  Maybe that's a good thing.  Still, a devastating even to have to deal with and live with the rest of his life.  I'm sure the pain will never end.

226	139	I didn't really feel anything from this story.  I don't care about amphibians and certainly don't care about them in England.  I just thought the science of it all was interesting, or the analysis . But it shows what humans do to all environments they come in contact with.  They change them.  The migrate and bring in new things.  And that affects stuff.  That's not always our fault, but that's the way of things.  And yet we think it's fine to let refugees and immigrants go where they want, as if there aren't repercussions for that. There are repercussions for everything.  Migration changes habitats.  Change isn't inherently bad, but it's inherently different, and people don't like that.	1.0	1.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2362	neutral	117	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	2.4634854491232874	2.2370856153168655	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

200	398	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1983	neutral	119	0.10526315789473684	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.21052631578947367	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.15789473684210525	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

Those that are endangered should be removed.

248	177	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.

247	177	So, I guess I just read a write up on the life of Janet Reno. The whole thing was pretty middling and seemed unbiased. Based on the information presented it seemed like she was an upstanding person, although you can never tell from an article written after someones death. I had heard her name before, but I was a child during the Clinton administration, so I really didn't know who she was until reading this article.	1.1666666666666667	1.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2372	neutral	76	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.09090909090909091	2.4861945341156018	2.1087369325509795	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

199	398	Hye buddy, I just read an article that you might find interesting. Apparently, wind turbines that companies use for power generation kill a lot of birds every year. But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless. It seems that no matter how much we try to protect the environment, our effect on it is always worse than we imagine.	4.666666666666667	1.5	51	1	7	5	41	64000	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.571	2.143	3.429	3.714	2	train	1887	neutral	92	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.25	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.0	2.9211927933062913	2.8101045912106017	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

It is terrible and is likely being caused by human intervention. At least to the point that people are causing the virus to spread faster by them constantly moving the animals and man made ponds being built.

374	367	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	1.8333333333333333	1.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2357	neutral	138	0.1702127659574468	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.1276595744680851	0.2553191489361702	0.10638297872340426	0.06382978723404255	0.02127659574468085	0.047619047619047616	2.5914474085383152	2.4718460691420208	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

Even when tenuous peace is declared the governments that are installed by US interests are almost destined to fail.	3.8333333333333335	2.75	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2059	anger/disgust	67	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.08	0.16	0.16	0.0	0.08	0.1	2.5480034117073003	2.586188632074898	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and low distress levels.

286	71	I feel really bad for the rangers, who were just doing their job and were treated unmercifully by the villagers.  And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.	5.333333333333333	5.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2078	fear/sadness	118	0.15384615384615385	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.19230769230769232	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	2.8106067462790105	2.6044920664133167	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.

It's hard not to have an emotional response to the suffering of any creature.	5.833333333333333	2.375	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	2141	neutral/sadness	62	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.07142857142857142	0.42857142857142855	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.0	2.9382395942992794	2.6815418626586043	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

71	3	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.	4.0	3.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	2147	neutral/sadness	133	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.12903225806451613	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.0	2.674559314803139	2.6434111615432863	An essay written by a 22 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

90	304	"A few thoughts about this.  First, amazing how far down the car accident death statistics are.  That's amazing.  Second, I find it interesting that 2007 is when young suicides spike.  That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.

I also loved how that one person said that this type of thing could happen to anyone.  No.  No it couldn't.  I don't live in a shithole country where I have to flee persecution and get raped and impregnated and go crazy along the way.  I live in a civilized country where people aren't animals and you can mostly go about your daily life without too much trouble.

347	113	This article is something i can really agree with. I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.	5.0	3.125	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	2157	hope/neutral	128	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.06666666666666667	0.0	2.681165264634731	2.6242989345013825	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again.
