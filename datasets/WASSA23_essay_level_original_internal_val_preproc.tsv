24	281	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	1594	hope/sadness	130	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.25	0.05	0.05	0.058823529411764705	2.921270175908798	2.719409547178719	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 58000$.

437	308	This article really brings you back down to earth. It shows everything in science is not correct and there is still much for us to learn. It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1593	hope/sadness	136	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.24	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.05263157894736842	2.9615192213757	2.7765868181672064	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need.	6.666666666666667	6.375	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	1586	hope/sadness	77	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.14705882352941177	0.11764705882352941	0.08823529411764706	0.23529411764705882	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.0	0.20588235294117646	0.14285714285714285	3.312795615473694	3.1052871674743683	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

165	375	I find this story to be eye-rollingly typical of people.  I assume that the people who go up to the Arctic to see it like polar bears and don't want to see them extinct.  And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

These other people have no inherent rights to be taken care of or even allowed to enter the country.  We exist in a world of borders and law--for the better.  These people come from countries that are hellholes they must flee, and they are complicit in that.  How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me.  They have no right to that.

It's very unfortunate what happened to them.	1.0	1.375	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	1725	sadness	71	0.2	0.1	0.05	0.0	0.0	0.05	0.3	0.2	0.1	0.0	0.0	3.049899414657366	2.703777875664926	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

They need to be able to justify working conditions and not just have people working to make money. All of these people had families that are just stuck without them for such a silly reason to die.

345	186	This article was a little hard to follow as I dont follow or know much about whats going on in the other side of the world. It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance. Something needs to be done to help.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1728	sadness	131	0.16	0.04	0.08	0.08	0.04	0.24	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.9662714617149524	2.840008237173438	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

He traveled through rough conditions like a jill field and stillended up dying. I think thes eprograms by the government to kill animals is horrifying. We should all live together in hamony. If they are a pest we should find ways that dont harm them like relocating the animals to help the problem not kill innocent souls.Someday they will find a solution that wont harm lives and live in peace.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1868	sadness	97	0.23684210526315788	0.05263157894736842	0.05263157894736842	0.07894736842105263	0.0	0.10526315789473684	0.23684210526315788	0.13157894736842105	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.0	3.0188541768942163	2.8638008886888193	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.

It is very sad and hard to imagine what it must be like to live in a country like that, where you may be forced to leave at any moment due to acts of violence and war.	5.166666666666667	1.75	7	1	2	5	29	44000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	1	train	1679	sadness	57	0.2	0.05	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.05	0.25	0.15	0.0	0.05	0.0	3.1291559140176757	3.051717990626761	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 44000$.

255	413	This is an incredibly sad story!  All these people out trying to have fun and then they lost their lives.  I imagine the fear when they were hiding, it must have been so terrible.  And the families are just as much victims as the people who lost their lives.  The whole thing is terrible, and all of this for nothing.  Terrorist attacks are the most senseless killing and loss of life.  It is really tragic to me, and these people seem to have no regard for human life or suffering.  IT's not even human.	5.5	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	1840	sadness	94	0.2	0.15	0.025	0.0	0.025	0.025	0.25	0.2	0.1	0.025	0.06666666666666667	3.152665014101456	3.012071373619983	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

Everyone should be able to have shelter, food, and a nice place to sleep on. I feel like these people are almost being treated like dirt and it's very unfair.	1.0	2.0	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	1800	sadness	65	0.09090909090909091	0.13636363636363635	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.0	3.0166862214803527	2.7589434950858935	medium	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

There is nothing you can do about it. She was the very first of four woment to fly the J-10 fighter jet. The J-10 is a single engine fighter jet.

227	139	Have you heard of the current situation with the amphibian population of the UK. They are being affected by a type of virus right now that is causing much of their population to be wiped out. It is terrible and is likely being caused by human intervention. At least to the point that people are causing the virus to spread faster by them constantly moving the animals and man made ponds being built. I hope the scientific community steps in to correct the issue or many more animals will be harmed.	1.1666666666666667	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	1891	neutral	91	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.2857142857142857	0.19047619047619047	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	3.0001018890559474	2.9366226342464863	low	low	An essay written by a 23 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

213	273	I view the content that is sent to me online as my virtualized personalized email inbox. I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate their works cited to the various other work they are completing in ways to document not only their feelings on the article, but also progress on their goals as a person regarding their personalized information they receive. However, we as mTurk workers are afforded the luxury, and in fact the article more relates to the fact that remote workers are sometimes shut off from communication to the outside world by regular means. This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply. When I contact my superiors that also work remotely, most projects are mishandled in ways and my personalized communication style.	3.8333333333333335	3.375	15	1	5	1	30	10000	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.143	3.429	3.286	1	train	2356	neutral	133	0.0	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.22727272727272727	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.03333333333333333	2.887261205531932	2.6573156170130865	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 10000$.

Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?

The zoo animals should be slaughtered to feed people.  The horses slaughtered to feed to animals should be fed to people.  The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.

It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea.

You know when something is trying a little too hard to tug on your heartstrings and it just has the opposite effect?	4.666666666666667	3.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	2037	neutral	59	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	2.7344366080949953	2.4763844409039826	medium	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

279	370	I just read a story about school children in Venezuela that are apparently starving due to the lack of government investment in food programs. The image of school children falling asleep or fainting due to lack of nutrition is just absolutely heart breaking. I can't imagine what the parents must feel having to send their children to school where they will not eat at all. A child can't learn without appropriate nutrition.	6.0	4.25	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	1903	neutral	72	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.961231520865773	2.8544807132793224	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

152	125	Reading about pets dying is never fun. I'm sure that house fires claim the lives of many pets considering the fact that they are physically incapable of opening doors or windows. Should we grieve pets' lives any less than we grieve the lives of humans?

469	326	I feel for anyone feeling targeted or unsafe under this president in office. I find that alot of worries are just fear mongering from liberal media. I think this happens with any president I know many whites were afraid of obama being in office and only serving african americans and same here they believe trump only will help out upper white class. But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating. Also, I think it is right that more of the illigal immigrants should be worried as he directly said he is going after them which is just since they are breaking out us laws. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1915	neutral	127	0.13513513513513514	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.16216216216216217	0.24324324324324326	0.08108108108108109	0.02702702702702703	0.05405405405405406	0.05263157894736842	2.8019765249261117	2.785634044839004	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

277	370	I do feel for the people in the country, especially the starving kids, who presumably don't understand what's going on except for the fact that they're hungry.  But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.	3.1666666666666665	4.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2398	anger/disgust	134	0.20588235294117646	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.029411764705882353	0.4117647058823529	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	2.553277780366228	2.4901476129719273	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

We hurrah and protract these horrible situations in the middle east and when people are finally forced to pick up and leave we say, ""Sorry, we can't help you."""	4.833333333333333	5.5	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2067	anger/disgust	72	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.125	0.14285714285714285	2.747303502525891	2.735116507282853	low	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

That's been going on for decades anyway.  I'm sure it's pointless, but these two sides won't back down so it'll keep going on.  They're too nuclear powers so that's the only thing that makes this kind of interesting.  I love how the Bollywood directors won't hire Pakistani actors.  Pakistan sucks.  They harbor a lot of terrorists and a lot of bad crap happens in, and comes out of, Pakistan.  I'm sure they're to blame for most of the hostilities in the region.	1.0	1.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2056	anger/disgust	117	0.06666666666666667	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.1	0.0	0.13333333333333333	0.23333333333333334	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.0	2.2481017247301005	2.1675161960723415	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.

120	9	It is really hard to read stories about natural disasters that impact nations on a major scale. There are only so many things that can be done to prepare for something like this and most of the time the preparations only mitigate minimal damage. It is a bit sickening to see the response that some people have in these situations. Rather than help their neighbors, they pillage and rob the resources from others that are dealing with the natural disasters.	4.5	2.125	2	1	2	1	30	30000	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.5	4.0	1.571	4.0	3.857	1	train	2120	disgust	80	0.12	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.0	0.12	0.16	0.12	0.16	0.04	0.0	3.0616086134189704	2.828653907840816	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

71	3	The heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride: Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim.

I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.

347	113	This article is something i can really agree with. I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

243	19	I don't feel empathy for the refugees, who are complicit in corruption and worthless systems of government that lead to their need to flee.  Nor do I think they have any right to do what they're doing.  And every country has every right to keep them out and let them deal with their own situation in their own country.  But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.  How disgusted would I be if I were a German citizen and Merkel said Germany would take in one million refugees.  Why not just hand the country over to Syria and these other craphole places and we'll go live on their sand piles?

These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this. The fact that we haven't fixed things yet is quite scary and we need to do the right thing and take steps to clean up the problem.	6.0	6.25	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	2431	fear/neutral	76	0.14285714285714285	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.09523809523809523	0.09523809523809523	0.0	2.859611613962261	3.003268596999805	low	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.

430	397	After reading the article, i felt really alarmed and worried about wildlife heading into the future. I think that more and more species of animals will start to die out and go extinct because of lack of water as well as food. Hopefully the future generation could figure something out to combat this because if it continues down this path, Earth will end.	1.0	1.625	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	2432	fear/hope	63	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.3125	0.1875	0.0	0.0625	0.0	2.865682996401917	2.804873561602851	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

374	367	It's very difficult to fathom living somewhere where airstrikes can take you out at any given moment, regardless of where you are.  It really makes me grateful to live in this beautiful nation where we live, America, and to have the freedoms that we have.  In this story, the man's eight children lost their father and his wife lost her partner.  That is very tragic, and all for a bunch of senseless killing.  The US was supporting these airstrikes which is sort of sad.  I find the whole situation over there so senseless.  IT's like they are all just killing each other nonstop for no valid reason.	2.5	1.5	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2433	joy/sadness	107	0.14285714285714285	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.14285714285714285	0.2	0.17142857142857143	0.05714285714285714	0.02857142857142857	0.0	2.99084228119686	2.915323058888911	medium	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

319	39	I just read about an unfortunate wolf that had been tagged by conservationists, wandered away from his pack and murdered by overzealous wildlife exterminators. I wasn't even aware that these types of individuals existed. I knew oil companies employed wildlife exterminators in the far north, but apparently there are people paid to murder animals here in the US.
