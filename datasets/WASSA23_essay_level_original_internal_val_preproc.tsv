340	223	I feel bad for the mother and her two daughters that died in the accident. I'm a person that worries and being in a trailer would have me worrying. It is very sad that their life were cut short because they wanted to enjoy sometime together and go for a ride on Halloween.  I hope that the other people involved in the crash find peace.	6.5	2.875	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	1584	hope/sadness	65	0.1111111111111111	0.027777777777777776	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.08333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1388888888888889	0.1388888888888889	0.027777777777777776	0.1111111111111111	0.15384615384615385	2.898057416549239	2.7857397608843626	low	low	An essay about the article 223, written by a 37 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

304	347	One of the biggest fears of a parent, is that they die and can not protect their children especially when they are young, like the children in the article.  The mother has a lot of faith in her child to leave her by herself at the age of 12. It is a sad reminder that some people do not get a childhood and life is very hard. I hope they all get the food that they need.	6.666666666666667	6.375	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	1586	hope/sadness	77	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.14705882352941177	0.11764705882352941	0.08823529411764706	0.23529411764705882	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.0	0.20588235294117646	0.14285714285714285	3.312795615473694	3.1052871674743683	medium	medium	An essay about the article 347, written by a 37 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

308	48	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	3.5	5.5	38	2	6	1	35	148000	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	1	train	1590	hope/sadness	143	0.10526315789473684	0.05263157894736842	0.07894736842105263	0.10526315789473684	0.10526315789473684	0.21052631578947367	0.15789473684210525	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.07894736842105263	0.041666666666666664	2.940207057128023	2.766534416358188	medium	medium	An essay about the article 48, written by a 35 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000$.

207	201	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.	1.0	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2282	anger	127	0.17142857142857143	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.2	0.02857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.17142857142857143	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.6552150555355345	2.7455473779221067	medium	medium	An essay about the article 201, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

222	417	In this case I totally support the actions of the man who shot the dog.  He was totally within his rights and it was highly inappropriate and inconsiderate of that woman to have an unleashed dog running int he park.  The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.

I think that society as a whole needs to understand mental health better and how to help people.	1.0	1.75	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	1701	sadness	69	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.07142857142857142	3.077748781489058	2.8624728937263932	high	medium	An essay about the article 281, written by a 29 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000$.

85	353	I think this is sad, although there aren't many details to know what really happened.  I can't decide whether I think it was worse or better that they died together.  Sort of strange to think what might have happened that cost them both of their lives.  You wonder if one of them caused the death of the other.  That would be pretty awful.  But I guess it doesn't really matter now.  It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.  Even though they're dead bodies it seems lonely that they'd be there without getting taken back to civilization.	3.333333333333333	2.75	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	1812	sadness	103	0.13513513513513514	0.10810810810810811	0.08108108108108109	0.08108108108108109	0.08108108108108109	0.08108108108108109	0.13513513513513514	0.13513513513513514	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.15384615384615385	2.4462914634871504	2.3750911471284852	low	low	An essay about the article 353, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

I'm so glad I've never lost a pet.	4.166666666666667	3.25	13	2	6	1	25	60000	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	2	train	1804	sadness	65	0.10714285714285714	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.03571428571428571	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.2857142857142857	0.21428571428571427	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.08333333333333333	2.8749667933440612	2.6301017264198236	medium	medium	An essay about the article 125, written by a 25 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000$.

251	413	This article was sad for me.  It definitely humanized the event and focused on the father, whom I felt sympathetic towards.  I also laughed a lot at the sentence about someone wrapping bacon around the door handle of a mosque.  But I thought the portrayal of the father was very real and relatable.  I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why.  But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event.  People there, trying to survive.  People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead.  People angry.  People trying to keep the public safe.

I hope that your research goes well, and if there is anyway that I can chat with someone else regarding this incident I would be more than happy to do so. War tears cities apart, and it is hard for me to understand how so many innocent people suffer due to the whims of those in power. I hope to get paid for my efforts.

Because there is no proof, probably nothing will be done. God help any woman these days who is harassed or touched or even raped and doesn't have proof. There is no justice any more. We have to worry about our daughters. 	3.8333333333333335	7.0	47	2	6	1	37	135000	6.0	6.0	1.5	7.0	3.0	4.857	3.571	4.286	4.857	2	train	2397	anger/disgust	69	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.2608695652173913	0.0	0.21739130434782608	0.17391304347826086	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.0	2.5630882243733266	2.8613271314154107	low	medium	An essay about the article 128, written by a 37 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 135000$.

454	182	Wow, this is unbelievable!!!  Who would do something like this to a tiny harmless kitten?  I'm shocked and thoroughly disgusted that someone would even be able to go through the actions to harm a kitten like this.  It is just sickening and hopefully they can find this person and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law, this is just outrageous and ridiculous.  It sounds like a precursor to serial killer behavior, honestly, because who does something like that except an extremely depraved person?	4.166666666666667	4.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	2071	anger/disgust	85	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.71245319918745	2.984059352818415	low	medium	An essay about the article 182, written by a 38 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

407	331	Being a woman myself i find this article very troubling. With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

291	242	To me this is very disturbing.  55 civilians were killed?  I mean I get that they killed some bad guys too, but to me it is not worth sacrificing so many innocent lives just to kill a few bad guys.  U.S. troops were killed too.  This whole thing is just terrible and tragic in my opinion.  IT sounded like some protocol was not followed either, which makes it even worse.  I think we need to mind our own business and get out of there honestly.  We have enough issues with our own country to be over there contributing to issues in others.	3.0	1.875	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2411	disgust	102	0.2	0.12	0.0	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.24	0.2	0.12	0.0	0.0	2.794930876467427	2.717463660483334	low	low	An essay about the article 242, written by a 38 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

216	247	This one sort of gets to me.  The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.  Awful to live with.	5.833333333333333	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2416	neutral/sadness	143	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.19230769230769232	0.19230769230769232	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.0	2.6821772746555674	2.552187431598643	medium	low	An essay about the article 247, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

111	45	This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	1.3333333333333333	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2151	anger/neutral	134	0.1951219512195122	0.12195121951219512	0.024390243902439025	0.07317073170731707	0.0	0.17073170731707318	0.2682926829268293	0.07317073170731707	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay about the article 45, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death.

Why not just hand the country over to Syria and these other craphole places and we'll go live on their sand piles?  It's lunacy.	1.0	4.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2185	disgust/fear	141	0.11764705882352941	0.09803921568627451	0.0784313725490196	0.058823529411764705	0.0784313725490196	0.11764705882352941	0.19607843137254902	0.0784313725490196	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.08695652173913043	2.7729777487770066	2.7050091089776496	medium	medium	An essay about the article 19, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

241	19	A just read a piece about the refugee crisis circa 2016. I'm wondering how many of the one million that Germany promised to provide asylum to are currently living in Germany. I know that this mass migration of refugees is part of the reason for the rise of nationalistic/fascist sentiment in a lot of places. I fear things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.	4.833333333333333	4.125	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2186	fear/neutral	69	0.23076923076923078	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.3076923076923077	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6179722505851473	2.6100270834897175	low	low	An essay about the article 19, written by a 29 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

430	397	After reading the article, i felt really alarmed and worried about wildlife heading into the future. I think that more and more species of animals will start to die out and go extinct because of lack of water as well as food. Hopefully the future generation could figure something out to combat this because if it continues down this path, Earth will end.	1.0	1.625	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	2432	fear/hope	63	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.3125	0.1875	0.0	0.0625	0.0	2.865682996401917	2.804873561602851	low	low	An essay about the article 397, written by a 29 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000$.

There needs to be more done to stop this. This war seems like it will never end. What can be done about it? Who knows at this point.

319	39	I just read about an unfortunate wolf that had been tagged by conservationists, wandered away from his pack and murdered by overzealous wildlife exterminators. I wasn't even aware that these types of individuals existed. I knew oil companies employed wildlife exterminators in the far north, but apparently there are people paid to murder animals here in the US.
