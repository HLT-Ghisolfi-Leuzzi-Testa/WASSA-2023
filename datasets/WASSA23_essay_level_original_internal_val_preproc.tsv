It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace	1.0	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	2276	hope/sadness	68	0.09375	0.09375	0.125	0.125	0.03125	0.15625	0.15625	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.1875	2.9450640727934734	2.8877504120511595	An essay written by a 23 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

Having air strikes hit your home has to be horrible and seeing love ones buried under what is left from your home is also horrible. I do not wish this on anybody.

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me.  I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.  These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence.

207	201	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.  It's disgraceful.	1.0	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2282	anger	127	0.17142857142857143	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.2	0.02857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.17142857142857143	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.6552150555355345	2.7455473779221067	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

458	371	I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	1.0	2.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	1629	anger	126	0.1935483870967742	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.1935483870967742	0.03225806451612903	0.22580645161290322	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.0	0.03225806451612903	0.06666666666666667	2.7327701042089507	2.750775429656553	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.

Its insane in this day and age a gun couldnt even make its way into the airport building. Maybe there needs to be even more measures to prevent this. I am so saddened that the victim had a family and children that have to sit with his death forever now. Airline attendants should be more protected. I wonder what the connection between the two was, was it revenge, he knew his schedule so there must have been something going on there. I think way more security now has to be implemented as this should have never even happened. Also the poor people stuck on the planes for three hours with a supposed shooter on the loose id be terrified.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1705	sadness	138	0.25	0.20454545454545456	0.06818181818181818	0.022727272727272728	0.06818181818181818	0.022727272727272728	0.20454545454545456	0.11363636363636363	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.741474084422063	2.825189701092452	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

453	182	This story really just hit me in the gut I did not want to even read any further. These stories disturb me for months I can't stand animal abuse. It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	1796	sadness	142	0.13157894736842105	0.13157894736842105	0.02631578947368421	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.10526315789473684	0.21052631578947367	0.15789473684210525	0.10526315789473684	0.02631578947368421	0.0	2.920567887536317	2.9229281816107426	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

418	301	The whole drug topic really makes me sad as I had a mother who I saw unravel from being addicted to pain killers. I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up. I have definitly seen way more about heroin overdose in my own suburbia it isnt disciminating agianst anyone it is sad it is ruining peoples lives.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2296	sadness	139	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.0	2.7661573858792	2.7282252537977776	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.

Perhaps better measures should be taken at this facility to be sure that they are identifying people correctly and that nothing else like this happens again.

He is clearly some sort of serial rapist and needs to be put where he cannot harm any more women because he has already harmed too many.  This type of thing is always sad because the victims can't undo the harm that's already been done to them.

I'm suprised more animal rights groups haven't become involved - really, if all those angry vegans out there spent more time helping animals and less time pontificating to the rest of us, they would do far more good.	5.666666666666667	2.625	27	2	7	1	46	41000	4.5	7.0	3.0	6.0	1.0	4.286	2.857	4.857	5.0	2	train	2347	sadness	91	0.13333333333333333	0.1	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.2	0.1	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.0	3.073896685657707	2.910046720197979	An essay written by a 46 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 41000$.

It breaks my heart these people are subject to being afraid of such violence and brutality. The women that were raped and especially by there government is nonesense and cant believe in 2019 this is still happening. They need to create a more civilized society over there. Even aid workers who are just there to help were brutally raped that tells me these people have no consequences for actions and to consious of human suffering.

I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	3.8333333333333335	1.125	13	2	6	1	25	60000	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	2	train	1755	sadness	102	0.17857142857142858	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.17857142857142858	0.14285714285714285	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.09090909090909091	2.7884964743490444	2.6457018966854022	An essay written by a 25 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

This handler must feel horrible as i know the dogs become like there actual partners and family. I think the guilt is punishment enough.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1682	sadness	122	0.09090909090909091	0.13636363636363635	0.11363636363636363	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.11363636363636363	0.045454545454545456	0.07142857142857142	2.974916129809511	2.838210210428864	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

236	245	I wonder if this type of thing is going to become more common as more people are forced to take care of elderly relatives at home.  Or mentally ill relatives.  Or both.  I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.  She might be scared and confused too.	3.8333333333333335	3.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	1789	sadness	124	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.3181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.5966982380845147	2.610244049344368	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

481	292	I know it is odd but I always feel a sense of compassion for these shooters. Yes they are evil and need to be punished but thinking of what lead them to try and kill innocent people they must have had something horrible in there life happen or been in a very toxic enviroment. There should be more talks of mental health and treatment for people instead of banning guns. There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns. This was also odd because he was older 70 years old,and hispanic I wonder if the tension and state of the US made him angered and want to carry out this act.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2294	sadness	128	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.06896551724137931	0.034482758620689655	0.0	0.13793103448275862	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.13793103448275862	0.0	0.0	2.93117078039479	2.8825443750586928	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Later the same day, when her mother turns up at the school, there is no sign of her daughter. No-one has seen her.

370	80	After reading the article, i couldn't help but feel disappointed in people and humanity. I feel bad because i read that the people in the community were killing police officers. It's terrible that police have to be viewed as a bad thing in society today when police were the ones we use to run to for help. I hope things turn out for the better for the country in the future.	1.0	1.5	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	2341	sadness	71	0.16666666666666666	0.11904761904761904	0.023809523809523808	0.11904761904761904	0.023809523809523808	0.16666666666666666	0.11904761904761904	0.11904761904761904	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.045454545454545456	2.9962557751316368	2.9247318669938993	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

Kids were in a trailer and a truck plowed into the back of them.  It was extremely disturbing to read.  I could just visualize the pain, suffering, and panic that was taking place.    I can't imagine losing 2 of your own children.  Further reading showed the driver had lost her husband.  Whoever was driving the truck will have to live with this the rest of their lives.

200	398	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	1983	neutral	119	0.10526315789473684	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.21052631578947367	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.15789473684210525	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

225	417	After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.	1.1666666666666667	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2005	neutral	115	0.22857142857142856	0.14285714285714285	0.02857142857142857	0.05714285714285714	0.02857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.753786559096828	2.800814964553498	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

374	367	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	1.8333333333333333	1.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	2357	neutral	138	0.1702127659574468	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.1276595744680851	0.2553191489361702	0.10638297872340426	0.06382978723404255	0.02127659574468085	0.047619047619047616	2.5914474085383152	2.4718460691420208	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

They are not as democratic as the United States so i am sure they hide things fro mtheir people.	1.0	1.5	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	2038	neutral	61	0.3076923076923077	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.23076923076923078	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.446949610201641	2.394610314958785	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 85000$.

36	58	I had never considered the zoos in countries like Venezuela. I'm concerned that it seems like they're being fined and punished for their predicament. I think other zoos throughout the world should step up and try to rescue the animals, or at the very least, preserve them for a scientific purpose and euthanize them humanely. Those that are endangered should be removed. It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints.	5.833333333333333	6.125	45	2	6	1	31	34999	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	1	train	1994	neutral	82	0.18518518518518517	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.1111111111111111	0.18518518518518517	0.14814814814814814	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.08333333333333333	2.7043999710322	2.709126651369151	An essay written by a 31 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 34999$.

You think of the people that are doing this and put yourself in there shoes but also the countries who get these transplants and have to deal with them. Every human deserves a life free from harm and these lands really arent anyones but i can see having undocumented people invade your country is a bad thing that is why there is systems in place to keep track of people. I think more should be done to help these countries so people do not want to flee we need to build there government and police up so they are equipped to fight terrorist groups and rebels who push there citizens out.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	2020	neutral	121	0.21621621621621623	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.05405405405405406	0.08108108108108109	0.08108108108108109	0.21621621621621623	0.10810810810810811	0.05405405405405406	0.02702702702702703	0.04	3.0442292636304615	2.9436776018188637	An essay written by a 27 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 25000$.

Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.

The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.

448	11	The fact that 13 civilians were killed shows that this rivalry between India and Pakistan is something that needs to be fixed. They were killed in Pakistan land as well and India should be the one to blame here if what they're saying is true. Surgical strike was also launched and I don't know if that can be justified.	5.833333333333333	6.25	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	2	train	1909	neutral	59	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.23076923076923078	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.0	2.532376953577472	2.4894261291068083	An essay written by a 32 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 35000$.

458	371	I feel like there is more to this story.  Apparently the officer was trying to protect himself because she was punching and kicking him to try to resist arrest.  That doesn't make it okay for him to punch her in the face, though, he should have been more professional.  But he is human and it might have been his first instinct, who knows.  I saw that she is suing the city for a million dollars, I bet she is trying to bank on this whole incident.  I don't know how I feel about this really.

346	113	The ban on smoking outdoors in the article takes place in England, but the same thinking could happen in the United States. I do not like the ban. I do not smoke or want my children smoking, but what other adults do with their bodies is their business. If there is proof that smoking in an outdoor space hurts others, then it should be banned. If it only hurts the smoker, then it should be allowed.	2.5	6.125	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	1	train	2379	neutral	76	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.6	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.443140761149049	2.467117365053837	An essay written by a 37 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 40000$.

But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.	3.1666666666666665	4.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2398	anger/disgust	134	0.20588235294117646	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.029411764705882353	0.4117647058823529	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.0	2.553277780366228	2.4901476129719273	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

149	147	I've never heard about this issue before.  It seems typical for the region, however.  Economy at all costs, especially when you have two trillion people living in these geographically small countries.  And you wonder why environmentalism is a losing battle.  The U.S. and other civilized countries can do all they want.  If a place like Indonesia is willing to burn down all their forests to manufacture palm oil, you're fighting a losing battle.  Again, I keep getting back to this idea: Why are we considered the barbarians in the world?  Most of the world are one step above apes.  They're heathens.  What Reagan said to Nixon was correct.  We treat these people as equals?  We leave our fate to people who don't even wear shoes?

I'm not sure I needed to hear about all the specifics as to why seabirds are eating plastic, but it definitely hurts to see that it's going on.

Keep it in a cabinet very high up out of reach where the baby can not get to it, no exceptions!

Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.

177	283	I don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	1.0	2.625	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2110	disgust	136	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.35294117647058826	0.17647058823529413	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.0	2.336916703922166	2.3160930197953182	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

I think this is so sad and is part of a larger problem of opioid addiction.	7.0	4.625	57	2	6	1	47	110000	7.0	6.5	4.5	5.5	7.0	5.0	2.143	3.571	5.0	1	train	2138	neutral/sadness	60	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	3.1495963303284835	3.006992373053358	An essay written by a 47 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 110000$.

Had he not had a criminal record I doubt he would have been deported.  Having said that, I feel extremely sympathetic for the abusive upbringing he had.  To get adopted by people who then abused him, then abandoned, adopted again and abused some more, is just unconscionable and repulsive.  And I'm sure it lead to his criminality, unfortunately.  This guy sure got dealt a bad hand, but is interestingly dealing with it well, it seems.  I'm not sure if that's a good sign or a bad sign for his future."	6.0	6.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2417	neutral/sadness	127	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.0196078431372549	0.0784313725490196	0.0196078431372549	0.11764705882352941	0.1568627450980392	0.13725490196078433	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.047619047619047616	2.6216204552794036	2.6081048356638945	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.

111	45	This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	1.3333333333333333	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2151	anger/neutral	134	0.1951219512195122	0.12195121951219512	0.024390243902439025	0.07317073170731707	0.0	0.17073170731707318	0.2682926829268293	0.07317073170731707	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

383	23	This is a tragic story but it's also what happens in third-world countries where you pull a truck off the side of the road to sell fuel to citizens.  The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.	2.333333333333333	2.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	2152	anger/neutral	134	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.17857142857142858	0.07142857142857142	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.21428571428571427	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.5314008635300813	2.4125070771761905	An essay written by a 41 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 28000$.

The US was supporting these airstrikes which is sort of sad.  I find the whole situation over there so senseless.  IT's like they are all just killing each other nonstop for no valid reason.	2.5	1.5	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	2433	joy/sadness	107	0.14285714285714285	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.14285714285714285	0.2	0.17142857142857143	0.05714285714285714	0.02857142857142857	0.0	2.99084228119686	2.915323058888911	An essay written by a 38 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 42000$.

58	72	it's crazy how elephant poaching is still a thing. Nearly 1/3 of all elephants have been poached just because of the ivory. I cannot believe this is still going on. There needs to be more done to stop this. They are gonna end up causing these elephants to go extinct and then what? For some ivory? This makes no sense at all.	2.6666666666666665	1.75	46	1	6	1	34	68000	5.5	6.0	5.5	5.0	6.5	3.143	1.714	3.857	2.429	2	train	2191	anger/surprise	62	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.25	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.5891313872141493	2.662351226999225	An essay written by a 34 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 68000$.

322	52	I just read an article about a Korean man who was adopted from South Korea when he was three, brutally abused, lived in the U.S. for 37 years and is now being deported because the adoption agency/foster family did not file the correct paperwork for him to get his citizenship. I don't understand how people can sleep at night after persecuting people in unfortunate circumstances like this.	6.333333333333333	5.625	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	2192	disgust/neutral	67	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.5	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.7406909859245903	2.603962409309341	An essay written by a 29 years old female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 39000$.

319	39	I just read about an unfortunate wolf that had been tagged by conservationists, wandered away from his pack and murdered by overzealous wildlife exterminators. I wasn't even aware that these types of individuals existed. I knew oil companies employed wildlife exterminators in the far north, but apparently there are people paid to murder animals here in the US.
