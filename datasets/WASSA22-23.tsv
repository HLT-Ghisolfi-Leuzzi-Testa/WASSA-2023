The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is.

I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis.

It's sad to see kids seeking attention in this light.	sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	44.0	14500.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	2.5	4.5	3.429	1.429	3.714	3.143	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

1.833	2.375	This story left me feeling pretty confused. It was so short and didn't provide a lot of answers at all.

Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression.

I find it funny how we are so enclosed in our small little world, while in Chicago we are celebrating about CUBS victory in over 100 years, in Haiti, they are suffering for water and food.	surprise	1.0	2.0	2.0	27.0	39000.0	5.0	5.5	2.5	3.5	1.0	3.429	3.429	3.0	3.571	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

You know my position when it comes to Trump, you know I dislike the man and all; however, I do not believe a teacher can use his position to bash someone especially on school grounds. I believe he can state his opinion, but not disguise it as the truth. That could be very dangerous.	fear	1.0	2.0	2.0	27.0	39000.0	5.0	5.5	2.5	3.5	1.0	3.429	3.429	3.0	3.571	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

They could sue the developers, but no amount of money is going to compensate them for the health issues these kids are going to experience due to lead poisoning. The worst thing about this is, if it were a wealthy white neighbourhood adjacent to the industrial site they wanted to demolish, you know they would have taken every precaution to test to see if there was any chance of releasing toxic amounts of lead into the vicinity. But it's a poor black neighbourhood, so of course they aren't as careful.	disgust	2.0	6.0	5.0	28.0	65000.0	6.0	7.0	3.0	3.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.714	3.143	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.   I think that our country should continue to report on these terrible conditions and try to get aid to Haiti from every source available.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	68000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	68000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	joy	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Words like “boiling water poured down 87-year-old farmer’s throat for hours on end,” and “his wife and two teenage daughters were tied with barbed wire in the bathroom, after which they were repeatedly raped, burned with a hot iron, and stabbed with a sharp object.”	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	32.0	25000.0	4.0	4.5	5.5	3.5	3.0	4.2860000000000005	3.143	3.143	2.571	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now, every person and company is its own media brand - and there are significantly less barriers to reaching people.his has allowed smaller brands to gain a foothold in the market much easier. When we see trends like craft beer, food trucks, and local fashion, that is often the result of harnessing social media platforms to build a following in a cost effective way.  Prior to smartphones and social adoption, it was much more difficult (and expensive) to reach people, especially if your location wasn’t on a main street.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going.

Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply.

I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

We are so used to seeing bananas as a common fruit at supermarkets that we never think of not ever eating another one again! I found this article very intriguing, there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to protect this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more resistant to various dangerous fungal strains.Apparently this presents a great challenge for the scientists but they are hoping to cultivate more banana plant varieties that will be more resistant to various illness.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	46.0	29000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals!

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida.

He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns.

They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2.0	6.0	1.0	59.0	25500.0	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A report I read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix!

I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1.0	7.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

It will help the people they have harmed and seek to right the wrong and there will be justice. Wells Fargo is big and they should not harm others and the articles is well told on what happened to them and what they did in detail. They were fined for repeated violations and have a clear intent of what they were doing and how they were acting towards their customers and was not the best way to act towards others.

It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.

6.0	2.125	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.

But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.

1.1666666666666667	4.75	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.

The man asked her to restrain her dog when it attacked her and she failed to do that several times so she had fair warning.  I'm sick of dogs running wild and attacking innocent bystanders, often resulting in grave bodily injury or death.  Somebody needs to do something to stop this problem.

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.	Anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Although this incident is pretty old news, it told of the unrest in Charlotte after a black man was killed by the police. In the protests, someone (not a cop) fired into the crowd, wounding a civilian and four police officers. It's just a sad commentary on where we're at with race relations in this country.

I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison. How could you kill and burn someone and for over something so minecule like getting hit on. Karma will get back at them and I hope in a grand way. The poor family of this man it is terrible.

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""

This type of thing is always sad because the victims can't undo the harm that's already been done to them.  Going through a length trial just brings it all back up and everybody l oses.

I think alot needs to be done to make sure the river is restored and blockage is taken away so that this does not happen in the future. These fish cant move debris themsleves and i thin more light needs to shine down on what is happening so maybe a council can come together and monitor or take over and make sure the fish are in a thriving enviroment.

I feel bad for the man who lost his life and his children that had to lose their father like that. I even feel bad for all the people at the airport that had their lives interrupted.

6.5	4.625	I just read an article about a boy falling out of an apartment window and dying. That is so sad he was only 2 years old. The little boy pushed open the screen in his bedroom and fell out of the window to his death. We should all make sure our windows are secure and our kids cannot open them .Omg that poor boy was proably hurting so bad before he died. I cannot imagine what the parents are going through after losing a child in such a manner.	Sadness	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	7.0	7.0	5.75	6.0	7.0	4.1425	1.0	2.0715	4.2145	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

It's so sad when things like this happen that result in such a massive loss of life.  I feel bad for all the families affected and plus of course all the victims who lost their lives due to something so unnecessary.  Sometimes things like this just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it I guess.	Sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

It's distressing to hear about children who are innocent victims of violence in a country or even adults, but it just seems so far away and I Feel so removed from those things and people that it's hard to relate to.  I am still sad for them that they have the experiences they have and I am grateful for my life and freedom in America.

3.8333333333333335	1.125	I think it's pretty sad that the wolf got killed. I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	Sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	25.0	60000.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

If it was me I would have some sort of safety lock on them because I know children can do anything. Maybe the parents were just not educated on the dangers but it seems irresponsible they didnt check or know that was happening. That poor child died such a painful death it is hard to even fathem. Thankful for the guard who called 911 so someone didnt find the body later on. Im sure the parents feel horrible and blame themselves that is very sad to me.

The article didn't give a whole lot of detail, so one has to wonder what drove him to take such drastic action against people who were so close to him. The suspect committed suicide afterward, so I think that it would be considered a crime of passion? Anyway, horribly tragic.

This town needs some better traffic laws and maybe drivers licensure tests. It seems to be a very prevelant thing auto accidents and needs to be adressed with threat to the public. Also thinking about how traumatized the on scene responders but also the others who were on there and around it at the time I would feel so sad for a long time like survivors guilt. I hope everyone gets therapy to talk about how much this probably effected them.	Sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Perhaps better measures should be taken at this facility to be sure that they are identifying people correctly and that nothing else like this happens again.  I think a lot of military casualties are extremely sad, but it seems especially bad when it is not even in combat and just in a situation like this that should have been harmless.

3.6666666666666665	2.25	This is a highly disturbing story.  How could this man feel the need to harm his own children?  If we wanted to take his own life, fine, but why the children?  It is obvious he had some serious issues since there was a pending domestic violence charge, so there is clearly more to this story.  But either way, I find it very sad for the kids who lost their lives for no reason.  And what about the rest of the family?  Where was the mother in this story?  How grieved she must be.  The whole thing was very very sad.	Sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The area doesn't get water year round so they have to find ways to save water for the dry months.

I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.  It's very unclear what the Americans could have been thinking, but they clearly made a mistake and suffered from it.

I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.

I hope that this truly was a ""bad accident"" as described by the Sheriff, and not serious neglect or negligence or something.  But I'm not sure what the procedures are for keeping police dogs in cars, and what the likely explanation is for something like this.  The police officer presumably feels terrible, and I feel bad for him too, as long as the mistake was honest.  If it wasn't then I have no sympathy for him.  But if it was then I bet he feels horrible and partly doesn't want to show his face to the other officers anymore."

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	Sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

There were so many warning signs that were ignored where people could have intervened and gotten her the help she needed.

It seems like there is not much of a good solution for this scenario, as controlling guns just takes away protection from people who need it.  The bad guys still find a way to arm themselves.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.  Just stupidness all around.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	Anger/Neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension.  And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time.  I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed.  These people might as well be fictional characters to me.  Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.  And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.

7.0	2.5	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.  No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. (	Anger/Neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	62.0	29000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.

We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.  And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death.

1.8333333333333333	1.0	This is sad, I have not heard of this Indian Pakistani issue but it sounds like it is affecting a lot of people and a lot of lives.  I can't imagine living somewhere where you constantly  had to fear being bombed or shot or some catastrophe like that that caused imminent death or bodily harm.  It would just be so stressful and difficult to have to live like that.  I get worried about things like getting sick but jeez this just takes it to an all new level.  It makes me very grateful to live where I am instead of somewhere like that.  	Joy/Sadness	2.0	7.0	1.0	38.0	42000.0	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
1.0	5.5	It's the 21st century and we have barely moved women.   USA has slipped to 45th and we have African countries ahead of us.   For the past 100 years, it's all politics and government and who is going to win.  Definitely not for equality or fairness to genders.  I had a job in career that compared identically to a man's and he was paid 40% more than me.   You can't express it or you get fire because almost every state is an at-will state.

2.6666666666666665	1.75	it's crazy how elephant poaching is still a thing. Nearly 1/3 of all elephants have been poached just because of the ivory. I cannot believe this is still going on. There needs to be more done to stop this. They are gonna end up causing these elephants to go extinct and then what? For some ivory? This makes no sense at all.

6.333333333333333	5.625	I just read an article about a Korean man who was adopted from South Korea when he was three, brutally abused, lived in the U.S. for 37 years and is now being deported because the adoption agency/foster family did not file the correct paperwork for him to get his citizenship. I don't understand how people can sleep at night after persecuting people in unfortunate circumstances like this.

4.333333333333333	4.375	I feel like they are doing the right thing. These animals and children at the zoo should not be taking in this second-hand smoke. I feel like the correct thing to do is fix it and try and get these smokers out of there as soon as possible. I think  children should be protected and this is the correct way to do it.

2.0	3.125	This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either.

4.0	3.125	Reading about the situation in Syria is always eye opening. It's hard to believe so many people can continue to live in a war zone. The article I read said that a kilo of meat goes for around $40! What do these people eat if there is no food available? It's really hard to wrap my head around. Will the war ever be over?

5.833333333333333	4.75	I just read about an unfortunate wolf that had been tagged by conservationists, wandered away from his pack and murdered by overzealous wildlife exterminators. I wasn't even aware that these types of individuals existed. I knew oil companies employed wildlife exterminators in the far north, but apparently there are people paid to murder animals here in the US. Despicable.

6.166666666666667	6.0	I had to read this article over twice because toddlers overdosing on opioids is mind boggling! I wonder how and why they have access to this. I know its because sometimes parents drop these pills but if parents are that bad, why are they having kids in the first place? We need laws that test people before they have children in order to make sure they will be good parents.

1.0	2.625	I just read an article about the amount of food that Americans waste. I knew that it was high, but I never imagined the numbers that people have been putting up for the last few years. Did you know there are people who refuse to eat leftovers? What kind of first world dystopia do we live in where people won't eat food that isn't straight out of the kitchen?

1.0	2.0	This is a very disturbing article and i really hope that the girl grows up to be a decent person. What she had to go through was nothing that a child should ever have to go through. It was terrible and disturbing to say the least. Those two parents should be put in jail for their whole life or even the death sentence. The fact that thye can do this to a minor, let alone their own daughter, is so bad.	Anger/Hope	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	85000.0	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
