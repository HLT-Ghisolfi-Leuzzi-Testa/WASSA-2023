187	299	I honestly find this article more amusing than anything.  I absolutely loathe birds.  Can't stand them.  Want them all dead.  I don't even care how that affects the food chain or nature.  I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

231	128	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.

Apparently, human made garden ponds are contributing to the spread of this virus, but the article seemed wishy washy about how to best deal with the problem.

476	53	This article is very interesting to me. I think alot of consumers have a lack of education when it comes to food, food safety, labeling, and disposal. If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness.

And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

177	283	I don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.

196	398	This story bothers me more for the ignorance of our actions than for the actual results to the birds.  I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.
