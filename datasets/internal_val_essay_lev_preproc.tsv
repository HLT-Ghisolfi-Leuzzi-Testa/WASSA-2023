I do not know what I would do it that was my family and I. I would hope that I would do my best, but I can see how depressing and hopeless you could feel having your whole life changed because of a storm and not knowing where your next meal is coming from.	6.833333333333333	6.625	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	1	train	1	Hope/Sadness	4.597701149425287	3.4482758620689657	4.597701149425287	3.4482758620689657	3.4482758620689657	4.597701149425287	3.4482758620689657

It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace	1.0	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	47	Hope/Sadness	10.294117647058822	7.352941176470588	8.823529411764705	11.76470588235294	11.76470588235294	8.823529411764705	5.88235294117647
24	281	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	23	Hope/Sadness	3.846153846153846	3.846153846153846	6.153846153846153	3.846153846153846	7.692307692307692	0.7692307692307692	0.7692307692307692

188	299	It bothers me so much that we are polluting our oceans to begin with and then to see that we are harming even more animals because of it.

458	371	I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop.  If you get punched in the face by a cop, you were resisting arrest, almost assuredly. And I have no sympathy for anyone who resists arrest, even if you don't feel you should be getting arrested.  The best way to deal with the police is to cooperate.  Why is this not obvious to people?  If you have nothing to hide then that will come out in the end.  If she had no warrant, what were they going to book her on?  They'd figure that out and let her go.  But instead she resists arrest and gets arrested for that, and punched to boot.  Which she deserved as far as I'm concerned. 	1.0	2.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	457	Anger	7.936507936507937	1.5873015873015872	10.317460317460318	2.380952380952381	9.523809523809524	4.761904761904762	3.1746031746031744
182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	1.1666666666666667	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	681	Anger	3.1746031746031744	3.968253968253968	7.142857142857143	3.968253968253968	7.936507936507937	2.380952380952381	2.380952380952381

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me.  I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.  These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence.

470	326	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

I do not want anybody to kill themselves, but if you feel that way take your own life and let other people live theirs. 	6.666666666666667	5.0	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	780	Sadness	8.064516129032258	4.838709677419355	9.67741935483871	4.838709677419355	9.67741935483871	4.838709677419355	3.2258064516129035

I have nieghbors that are from syria and they are great people who have family still back there and they are just mortified and scared. They can not travel back home anymore and that would just take a huge tole on me. Getting a warning text message that you are going to be bombed I dont now how I would react.

It mentioned that one should not refrain from building garden ponds, but instead refrain from transferring material from said ponds? The whole article kind of missed the mark, I think.	2.0	2.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	727	Neutral	0.0	0.0	2.8169014084507045	8.450704225352114	2.8169014084507045	1.4084507042253522	1.4084507042253522
488	395	I just read a story about an apparent murder suicide in which the husband of a family of five killed his wife, three children and their dog. Their marriage was apparently going through a rough spot after having a child with a congenital heart defect and the husband just couldn't bear the thought of living without his wife. They seemed relatively happy on the exterior. It just goes to show that you can never really know what is going on behind the scenes.	4.166666666666667	1.25	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	987	Neutral	6.024096385542169	3.614457831325301	6.024096385542169	4.819277108433735	3.614457831325301	1.2048192771084338	1.2048192771084338

At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	199	Neutral	5.882352941176471	0.8403361344537815	6.722689075630252	3.361344537815126	5.882352941176471	0.0	0.0

It's too bad the wolf traveled so far looking for a mate just to be killed, but I guess these things happen sometimes.  Perhaps the sniper should have been a little more careful.  A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason.

They are killing people and show casing them in the streets it is hard to understand how in this day and age groups can do that it reminds me of the nazis during the holocaust I fear if this is not taen care of soon it will spread to other areas liek the us with more terroristic events happening.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	144	Fear/Sadness	10.0	5.833333333333334	12.5	1.6666666666666667	14.166666666666668	2.5	0.8333333333333334

The police and people are trying to protect the sacred wild life and beings but also the village is probably needing the meat of the animal or the money from selling it as they are a very poor country. I can see being so desperate in a third world country that this would seem like the police are cutting off or taking your only source of livlihood. These poor guys however they are just trying to protect and do what is right they do not deserve to be so violently attacked im suprised they were able to live through such a brutal beating.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

There are only so many things that can be done to prepare for something like this and most of the time the preparations only mitigate minimal damage.

216	247	This one sort of gets to me.  The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman.

I feel nothing but anger towards this man and extreme pity towards his wife and kids.	7.0	7.0	26	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	unknown	1	train	487	Anger/Sadness	6.593406593406593	3.2967032967032965	4.395604395604395	2.197802197802197	7.692307692307692	2.197802197802197	1.0989010989010988

491	218	This article really concerns and scares me. This could be any one of us effected by high levels of lead and never knowing. I am suprised that there is a level expectancy but no prosecution for exceeding it and not regular testing of water. The general population does not now about there water unless it becomes a national crisis like flint. I am very cocerned because they said so many communities are effected what is this doing to the children who are growing up on this water. I will be switching to bottled water because I just do not trust the water anymore to much covering up going on its so sad.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	490	Fear	3.571428571428571	0.8928571428571428	3.571428571428571	4.4642857142857135	4.4642857142857135	1.7857142857142856	1.7857142857142856
243	19	I don't feel empathy for the refugees, who are complicit in corruption and worthless systems of government that lead to their need to flee.  Nor do I think they have any right to do what they're doing.  And every country has every right to keep them out and let them deal with their own situation in their own country.  But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.  How disgusted would I be if I were a German citizen and Merkel said Germany would take in one million refugees.  Why not just hand the country over to Syria and these other craphole places and we'll go live on their sand piles?  It's lunacy.	1.0	4.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	242	Disgust/Fear	5.673758865248227	6.382978723404256	7.801418439716312	3.546099290780142	7.092198581560284	4.25531914893617	2.8368794326241136
273	146	these hate crimes have been rising lately and i feel it is due to more than just terrorists. These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this. The fact that we haven't fixed things yet is quite scary and we need to do the right thing and take steps to clean up the problem.	6.0	6.25	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	272	Fear/Neutral	9.210526315789474	6.578947368421052	7.894736842105263	7.894736842105263	9.210526315789474	3.947368421052632	2.631578947368421

I'm not really sure what else to say about it.  I hope justice works and is brought against these people.  This type of thing should never happen and I feel bad for the victims and families involved.  	2.333333333333333	2.75	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	325	Fear/Hope	12.857142857142858	10.0	11.428571428571429	5.714285714285714	8.571428571428571	7.142857142857143	4.285714285714286

I can't imagine living somewhere where you constantly  had to fear being bombed or shot or some catastrophe like that that caused imminent death or bodily harm.  It would just be so stressful and difficult to have to live like that.  I get worried about things like getting sick but jeez this just takes it to an all new level.  It makes me very grateful to live where I am instead of somewhere like that.  	1.8333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	449	Joy/Sadness	6.796116504854369	5.825242718446602	9.70873786407767	6.796116504854369	8.737864077669903	4.854368932038835	0.970873786407767
58	72	it's crazy how elephant poaching is still a thing. Nearly 1/3 of all elephants have been poached just because of the ivory. I cannot believe this is still going on. There needs to be more done to stop this. They are gonna end up causing these elephants to go extinct and then what? For some ivory? This makes no sense at all.	2.6666666666666665	1.75	46	1	6	1	34	68000	5.5	6.0	5.5	5.0	6.5	3.143	1.714	3.857	2.429	2	train	557	Anger/Surprise	4.838709677419355	3.2258064516129035	8.064516129032258	0.0	9.67741935483871	0.0	0.0
98	57	Humans are the most selfish and wicked of all creation. They treat the planet as they like and handle the animals with carelessness, forgetting that they have their own families and emotions. It is so sad that we take these animals away from their natural habitats and treat them unfairly.

288	71	I found this story quite distressing.  It was actually surprising to me that the mob attacked anti-poaching rangers.  But I guess they support poaching in that area?  Perhaps it is important to their economy?  Anyway, it is always distressing to me to read about angry mobs attacking officials who are just trying to do their job and do something positive for the community or for society.  This is an example of that and it is very distressing.  Really, what is wrong with people?	1.0	2.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	787	Disgust/Surprise	13.253012048192772	9.63855421686747	12.048192771084338	3.614457831325301	9.63855421686747	8.433734939759036	1.2048192771084338
