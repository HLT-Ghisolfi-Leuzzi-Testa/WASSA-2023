1	35	How sad is it that this kind of pain and suffering, and those kind of living conditions still exsist today? what a gap we have in society between developed countries and those that aren't. It's crazy to drive around the US and see all the money people spend on pointless things, and then to think about how the people in Haiti are living. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	0	7.936507936507937	4.761904761904762	11.11111111111111	9.523809523809524	14.285714285714286	3.1746031746031744	0	7.2082728898337365	6.74922613436306	3.8333333333333335	3.375	Sadness	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286
4	35	The article is kind of tragic and hits close to home as I am the son of Haitian immigrants. Haiti has a lot of problems that only become exaggerated during natural disasters. I think what the Haitian people really need from the international community is help developing infrastructure so they can address these issues themselves. Foreign aid only acts as a band aid.	79	1	6	3	33	64000	1	dev	3	6.349206349206349	1.5873015873015872	7.936507936507937	6.349206349206349	4.761904761904762	1.5873015873015872	0	7.471195450246655	6.475605946551894	3.0	1.0	Sadness	6.5	7.0	3.5	4.5	7.0	3.714	1.0	2.429	1.429

I'm sure it is a cultural thing but it is such unneccesary violence and conflict. It hurts both sides and I wish there was a way we could get them to set aside their differences.

You're a lot more narrow minded as a child and getting bullied can make it seem like your entire life is ruined. I think it's a bigger problem now because of technology.

87	304	It's pretty heartbreaking to hear and read stories about suicide. I have always felt like there is more that can be done for mental health with young and older people these days.  It's not only the youth that struggle with it but it seems so normalized at a younger age. I feel strongly that there is no excuse for someone to kill themselves.  Anything can be prevented and anyone can be helped.

Entire acres of forest are being destroyed for the wood they hold. Inside those forests are animals that have homes and families. They are all being displaced, or worse killed, by these greedy businessmen looking to turn a profit off of nature. After reading this article it sounds like the government of Indonesia is not committed to protecting the forests or the animals living in them.

Zoos are such a child centered place its a  no brainer its like banning smoking at a play place or daycare. Children who see adults smoking will grow up thinking that is normal and part of life and I think smoking should seem like an odd thing like drugs. Kids are so suseptible to disease as they are growing and second hand smoke that young can do nothing but bad. These laws are really great and should be applied to any public place make smoking wierd like drinking alcohol in public because it not only effects you but everyone around you!	96	2	3	1	27	25000	1	dev	348	5.982905982905983	4.273504273504273	6.837606837606838	11.111111111111112	7.6923076923076925	1.7094017094017095	0	3.5123120890615733	3.3843183829933725	6.0	6.0	Anger	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714

A vehicle carrying American soldiers failed to yield at a gate to an military base in Amman and Jordanian troops ended up opening fire on the vehicle. Apparently, there had been an attack on the base recently, so I can understand why the patrols would be on their toes.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	1	dev	461	8.108108108108109	1.3513513513513513	10.81081081081081	0.0	6.756756756756757	4.054054054054054	0	6.207415288867424	5.811271347495707	1.3333333333333333	1.25	Neutral	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143

Putting kids into foster homes where they must feel so confused and alone and scared makes me feel for them.  On the other hand, there's a reality to these situations that can't be ignored.  The real germ of these childrens' problem was their mother going to jail.  That's the germ.  After that they have to be raised by someone.  And then the children compound their problem by being delinquents.  I knew a boy who'd been adopted after growing up in a very violent environment.  The damage had already been done.  He tore apart the adoptive family and ruined his own life.  He's in jail in China now, for 20 years.

They get bad ones every year.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	2	dev	645	15.517241379310345	17.24137931034483	18.965517241379313	6.8965517241379315	15.517241379310345	3.4482758620689657	0	7.543800543303597	7.510970577621166	4.0	4.5	Sadness	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.5	3.0	4.857	3.143	2.571	4.857

When Cali is burning, is there a similar haze that affects the surrounding states? This is quite a scary situation. And to think that the problem was exasperated by the cutting down of trees for palm oil. I hope there's a solution to this massive problem. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	2	dev	649	12.121212121212121	10.606060606060606	24.242424242424242	6.0606060606060606	15.15151515151515	4.545454545454545	0	6.479069276694199	6.210790720741672	7.0	7.0	Neutral	3.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	6.5	3.429	2.857	4.571	4.0

The fire caused the people to be evacuated living in the home and two of the family's cats were also killed in the fire.

People die so frequently from this disease I wish there was more awareness and laws put in place to help reduce it. I think cigarettes should be outlawed instead of weed. It has been proven the harm they can do to people and kill them, its crazy that there still around to this day. I think more air pollution laws need to be put in place because people cant really help that alot and that clearly has an effect on human life.

They found him (Joseph Comunale) on Jersey Shore buried in a one foot deep grave stabbed 15 times and partially burned. (:.   To top off the horrendous event, Comunale who was a celebrity jeweler, one of the suspects was his surrogate son.   He took him in and found a job for him and was always there.  Sex is the unofficial charge of why he was murdered.   This is very disturbing to me.   I do not understand how anyone could be so brutal and evil.   I can't quit thinking about how his life ended.

These entire families that are being killed and maimed did absolutely nothing to deserve this kind of treatment.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	2	dev	930	12.162162162162163	1.3513513513513513	9.45945945945946	5.405405405405405	10.81081081081081	1.3513513513513513	0	6.057189080838015	5.86492428334707	5.833333333333333	5.625	Anger	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143

451	182	I can't imagine the kind of person that would do this to a sweet cute innocent kitten. Not only did they dump it on the side of the road, which is one kind of evil, but they tortured it in the process. Who ties up a kitten like that? It's so easy now a days if you don't want a kitten, put it on facebook or cragslist to get rid of it. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	950	6.944444444444445	5.555555555555555	5.555555555555555	19.444444444444446	9.722222222222223	4.166666666666667	0	5.86667094666085	5.830862992365866	3.8333333333333335	3.5	Disgust	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286

456	371	Another story about police brutality... I'm not surprised. While it does sound like this individual was giving the police a harder time than was needed, they are the professionals here and need to act like it. I don't think what she was doing warranted getting punched in the face. That is not a professional measure to subdue someone. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	955	5.172413793103448	0.0	13.793103448275863	6.8965517241379315	1.7241379310344829	5.172413793103448	0	7.490155582471392	6.970055777588029	3.5	2.5	Neutral	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286

The police department acknowledges this and it was captured on camera by several onlookers for the incident. Even the children witnessed the incident occur.

462	18	I think things like this are terrifying, especially because it seems like things are just starting to heat up in Syria and we haven't even started sending that many troops over there. It makes me nervous that it's going to be another long war and one that will will fight for seemingly no real benefit of our own. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	961	6.8965517241379315	0.0	10.344827586206897	3.4482758620689657	5.172413793103448	0.0	0	7.1651860493859845	7.1041607120981425	3.333333333333333	3.0	Fear	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286
471	297	After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for the people that were involved in the train crash. IT was a freak accident and something you can't control. It 's just sad because they had to leave all of their family behind and their lives will most likely never be the same. While reading it, i felt really worried because it could happen to anyone.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	2	dev	970	7.462686567164178	4.477611940298507	11.940298507462686	4.477611940298507	19.402985074626866	10.44776119402985	0	6.510143134564361	6.00429959683178	1.0	1.875	Fear/Sadness	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643

484	292	I wish this article had given us more info. Were there any people hurt? Where did this shooting take place exactly? I'm honestly a bit glad the guy killed himself, one because he can't hurt anyone else that way.

497	103	An option for this very well may be that the man was so drunk, and he was so out of it, that he went into his hotel room and banged around/fell or did something stupid to accidentally kill himself. He also could have very well done this on purpose too. Or the other option is that someone killed him. Either way, it's a sad waste of life. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	996	5.970149253731343	4.477611940298507	8.955223880597014	0.0	8.955223880597014	4.477611940298507	0	6.253244594924785	6.142931221295845	4.0	3.625	Anger	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286
