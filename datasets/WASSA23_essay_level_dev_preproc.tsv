1	35	How sad is it that this kind of pain and suffering, and those kind of living conditions still exsist today? what a gap we have in society between developed countries and those that aren't. It's crazy to drive around the US and see all the money people spend on pointless things, and then to think about how the people in Haiti are living. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	2437	3.8333333333333335	3.375	sadness	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.143	3.286	63	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.19230769230769232	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.0	2.9569193853378706	2.7707490674198714	medium	low	An essay about the article 35, written by a 21 years old white female, with a high-school diploma, with an income of 20000$.

4	35	The article is kind of tragic and hits close to home as I am the son of Haitian immigrants. Haiti has a lot of problems that only become exaggerated during natural disasters. I think what the Haitian people really need from the international community is help developing infrastructure so they can address these issues themselves. Foreign aid only acts as a band aid.	79	1	6	3	33	64000	1	dev	2438	3.0	1.0	sadness	6.5	7.0	3.5	4.5	7.0	3.714	1.0	2.429	1.429	63	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.5	0.25	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	2.953606612273712	2.6500168121326855	medium	low	An essay about the article 35, written by a 33 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 64000$.

I also agree with the conservationist that say all the paper laws in the world cant cut down on the killings if you dont control illigal trade that is were the focus needs to stay on.	96	2	3	1	27	25000	1	dev	2454	6.0	6.0	disgust	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	127	0.1111111111111111	0.1388888888888889	0.05555555555555555	0.1388888888888889	0.027777777777777776	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.9282738740519143	2.880408277193446	low	low	An essay about the article 72, written by a 27 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000$.

67	138	I wasn't bullied much as a child but I can really sympathize with people who there. You're a lot more narrow minded as a child and getting bullied can make it seem like your entire life is ruined. I think it's a bigger problem now because of technology. Before a child would only get bullied during school hours, hopefully outside of the sight of a teacher. Now children can be bullied 24/7 through technology since everyone has a cell phone and uses social media. It's a hard problem to solve. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	2455	7.0	7.0	sadness	3.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	6.5	3.429	2.857	4.571	4.0	90	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.11538461538461539	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.0	2.6862899054318925	2.6559709613875193	low	low	An essay about the article 138, written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

68	138	I just read an article about bullying in France. Apparently, the suicide of a 17 year old French girl has caused the country to reevaluate its approach toward bullying. I personally have never experienced intense bullying or ridicule first hand or even second hand. I guess I was a pretty likable kid after all. I think the key to solving problems like this is most definitely inclusion. The reason children feel this way is because they perceive themselves to be absolutely alone.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	1	dev	2456	3.0	3.375	neutral	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	82	0.07407407407407407	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037035	0.18518518518518517	0.07407407407407407	0.18518518518518517	0.1111111111111111	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.05555555555555555	2.679400962597707	2.63595129896258	medium	low	An essay about the article 138, written by a 29 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

87	304	It's pretty heartbreaking to hear and read stories about suicide. I have always felt like there is more that can be done for mental health with young and older people these days.  It's not only the youth that struggle with it but it seems so normalized at a younger age. I feel strongly that there is no excuse for someone to kill themselves.  Anything can be prevented and anyone can be helped. It's a hard time and age though and usually those kids feel like there is nothing left for them to live for when in reality they have an entire wonderful life ahead of themselves, regardless of past experiences. But that's just my opinion. 	84	2	4	1	25	55000	1	dev	2461	4.0	2.625	sadness	5.5	5.5	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.571	2.857	3.571	3.143	115	0.11428571428571428	0.08571428571428572	0.11428571428571428	0.05714285714285714	0.08571428571428572	0.2	0.11428571428571428	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.11428571428571428	0.043478260869565216	2.875294379647717	2.7323958743243653	low	low	An essay about the article 304, written by a 25 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 55000$.

I thought it was sort of peculiar how tritely the article dealt with the situation, though, seemingly paying more attention to how hot the dad was instead of the dissolution of a family.  And you wonder why marriages dissolve after 27 years and the kids grown.  What changes to push people to divorce at that point.  Maybe for married people that's not a complicated question, but I'm not married so I don't know.  Either way I think it's too bad for the girls that their parents are divorced.  But I'm not really moved by it.	91	1	6	1	41	28000	1	dev	2476	2.0	1.625	neutral	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	125	0.1388888888888889	0.16666666666666666	0.027777777777777776	0.08333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.442850348905032	2.3106057415985006	low	low	An essay about the article 99, written by a 41 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000$.

After reading this article it sounds like the government of Indonesia is not committed to protecting the forests or the animals living in them.

Zoos are such a child centered place its a  no brainer its like banning smoking at a play place or daycare. Children who see adults smoking will grow up thinking that is normal and part of life and I think smoking should seem like an odd thing like drugs. Kids are so suseptible to disease as they are growing and second hand smoke that young can do nothing but bad. These laws are really great and should be applied to any public place make smoking wierd like drinking alcohol in public because it not only effects you but everyone around you!	96	2	3	1	27	25000	1	dev	2511	6.0	6.0	anger	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	117	0.1	0.06666666666666667	0.16666666666666666	0.03333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.23333333333333334	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.1	0.0	2.6085606323207835	2.5602699637442226	low	low	An essay about the article 113, written by a 27 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000$.

Putting kids into foster homes where they must feel so confused and alone and scared makes me feel for them.  On the other hand, there's a reality to these situations that can't be ignored.  The real germ of these childrens' problem was their mother going to jail.  That's the germ.  After that they have to be raised by someone.  And then the children compound their problem by being delinquents.  I knew a boy who'd been adopted after growing up in a very violent environment.  The damage had already been done.  He tore apart the adoptive family and ruined his own life.  He's in jail in China now, for 20 years.

What's weird is the countries that want ivory trade have great elephant population statistics and the countries that want to protect elephants don't. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	2	dev	2557	4.333333333333333	3.125	neutral	3.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	6.5	3.429	2.857	4.571	4.0	70	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.0	2.4722371037790998	2.428742400608106	low	low	An essay about the article 72, written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

125	6	The article brought up many good points about how Americans see refugees and asylum seekers, as well as the internal conflict we battle when we imagine them taking shelter here. Most Americans are empathetic when we hear stories or see images however when the moment for us to do anything come along we don't find the nerve to act. The mock home evacuation was very interesting however it cannot fully convey the actual feeling people feel when their lives are ripped from them. It will take something different to move people to the point where they realize these people are legitimately fighting for their lives. 	88	1	6	3	30	55000	2	dev	2575	5.5	2.875	neutral	5.5	6.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	3.286	3.143	3.143	105	0.09090909090909091	0.12121212121212122	0.06060606060606061	0.12121212121212122	0.06060606060606061	0.21212121212121213	0.18181818181818182	0.06060606060606061	0.030303030303030304	0.06060606060606061	0.08	3.0659166470452925	2.7811336333508914	medium	medium	An essay about the article 6, written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.
