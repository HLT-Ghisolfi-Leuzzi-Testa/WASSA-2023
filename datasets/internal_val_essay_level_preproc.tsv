430	397	This was sad and I hope they can do something about it.  I hate that the wildlife is suffering since it is so innocent.  Maybe the government should make more efforts to fix this situation or at least improve it.  I get that it takes resources to do things but maybe they could find some small way to make a difference.  It seems like the ecosystem is in serious danger if nothing is done so someone needs to act fast for the sake of the animals who are helpless victims of this situation.	1.5	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	929	Hope/Sadness	2.150537634408602	3.225806451612903	6.451612903225806	5.376344086021505	7.526881720430107	3.225806451612903	2.150537634408602
24	281	I just read a really interesting but depressing article. It was about a woman who lived in the UK. She was the founding editor of Elle magazine. She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through. 	6.0	2.125	20	1	3	1	33	58000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.286	3.286	4.571	1	train	23	Hope/Sadness	3.846153846153846	3.846153846153846	6.153846153846153	3.846153846153846	7.692307692307692	0.7692307692307692	0.7692307692307692

182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad.  The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful.  Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient.  of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides.  But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online.  I'm not a strong person.  At all.  But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	1.1666666666666667	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	681	Anger	3.1746031746031744	3.968253968253968	7.142857142857143	3.968253968253968	7.936507936507937	2.380952380952381	2.380952380952381
467	326	This article is ridiculous.  I'm part Jewish and all of this is absurd.  Likening our country to Nazi Germany in any way is just embarrassing.  The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words.  I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense.  Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory.  Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran.  Is that what Jews want in a President?  They feel safe with that?  They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them?  People are stupid, even Jews, some of the smartest people in the world.	1.0	2.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	466	Anger	6.451612903225807	3.2258064516129035	5.645161290322581	6.451612903225807	9.67741935483871	4.032258064516129	2.419354838709677

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me.  I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.

231	128	This is such a messy issue.  While I believe sexual harassment is wrong, I also think we've gone past the point where allegations can be trusted.  I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.

I'm sure the parents feel terrible too for not being able to feed their children.  I know Venezuela has some huge economic crises going on, but they really need to get a grip on their situation or their people will not make it.  The country is a great example of why a dictatorship does not work.

Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.

The thought of innocent creatures starving to death in cages really turns my stomach.	5.666666666666667	4.625	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	37	Sadness	6.944444444444445	8.333333333333334	6.944444444444445	6.944444444444445	8.333333333333334	4.166666666666667	1.3888888888888888

These children do not deserve this and it's sad because they have their whole lives ahead of them.

238	245	This is a sad case of what seems like an elderly woman getting lost.  I feel sad for the family involved and the feelings they must have.  Or did they even notice she was gone?  You would think they would be out looking for her if they noticed.  Maybe it was just a lonely old woman by herself which is even more sad.  Either way, I feel like elderly people in general are often overlooked and that is unfortunate.

I can undertand people who commit sucide but to kill the whole family even the dog that is just evil. I think more help and mental reach out should be offered in communities to men. They bottle things up and this is what happens. Men are not allowed to show emotions and then they let it out in violence.

It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.

However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.  Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.	3.0	1.75	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	974	Neutral	4.132231404958678	2.479338842975207	4.958677685950414	4.132231404958678	5.785123966942149	3.3057851239669422	0.8264462809917356

Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help.

Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return.

It is so bad that she died without anyone showing her true love.	6.333333333333333	6.25	40	1	7	1	28	165000	6.25	5.75	3.25	6.75	6.0	3.357	2.429	3.2145	3.4285	2	train	523	Neutral	9.722222222222223	6.944444444444445	9.722222222222223	8.333333333333334	11.11111111111111	5.555555555555555	2.7777777777777777
235	128	I think it must be investigated thoroughly and if true this man should be removed from his position immediately. Groping is just as bad as rape in my honest and humble opinion and should be removed fast. I think a precedent has to be set to stop these things and in order for that to happen we must be able to iron the bad ones out.	6.0	5.75	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	234	Neutral	12.12121212121212	9.09090909090909	10.606060606060606	3.0303030303030303	12.12121212121212	0.0	1.5151515151515151
490	395	So, I just read a story about a family in which the husband and wife were going through domestic strife and the husband ended up murdering everyone and then killing himself. According to the article he attempted to put a band-aid on deeply rooted relationship issues by taking the family to Disney Land. Who thinks like that? Honestly, I can see taking any available route when desperate, but if your wife wants to leave you she is going to leave you.	5.5	1.875	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	489	Neutral	3.7037037037037033	1.2345679012345678	2.469135802469136	1.2345679012345678	6.172839506172839	3.7037037037037033	0.0

469	326	I feel for anyone feeling targeted or unsafe under this president in office. I find that alot of worries are just fear mongering from liberal media. I think this happens with any president I know many whites were afraid of obama being in office and only serving african americans and same here they believe trump only will help out upper white class. But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating. Also, I think it is right that more of the illigal immigrants should be worried as he directly said he is going after them which is just since they are breaking out us laws. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	968	Neutral	5.511811023622047	2.3622047244094486	8.661417322834646	5.511811023622047	7.086614173228346	5.511811023622047	2.3622047244094486
112	45	More than 40 people were hurt and it is quite depressing any time anyone is hurt.

357	44	Sometimes I wonder about the impetus that drives people who murder other people. I think there would be a lot less murder if guns didn't make it so simple. Pulling a trigger. Driving a blade into someone would take a lot more conviction that simply shooting a bullet. I don't know.

200	398	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	199	Neutral	5.882352941176471	0.8403361344537815	6.722689075630252	3.361344537815126	5.882352941176471	0.0	0.0

You think of the people that are doing this and put yourself in there shoes but also the countries who get these transplants and have to deal with them. Every human deserves a life free from harm and these lands really arent anyones but i can see having undocumented people invade your country is a bad thing that is why there is systems in place to keep track of people. I think more should be done to help these countries so people do not want to flee we need to build there government and police up so they are equipped to fight terrorist groups and rebels who push there citizens out.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	744	Neutral	5.785123966942149	2.479338842975207	7.43801652892562	2.479338842975207	4.958677685950414	2.479338842975207	1.6528925619834711

I understand fearing death and economy troubles but if everyone just left those countries the ones they flee to will just have similar problems. I can understand how Germany doesn't want to just accept anyone and yet at the same time can feel sorry for those that have legit claims and are just turned away because of where they are from.	3.8333333333333335	2.0	44	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	1	train	190	Neutral	5.747126436781609	3.4482758620689657	8.045977011494253	1.1494252873563218	9.195402298850574	3.4482758620689657	1.1494252873563218
236	245	Just saw this news story about an old lady who was confusingly wandering without proper clothes late at night and and thought I would share it with you. As we move well into our 30's, the cruelness of old age seems to be becoming clearer and clearer. Maybe there were other reasons for her state but my immediate reaction was that it was due to age related general loss of senses and awareness. May we help those of us who need help in such state and may our old age be free from such sad endings.	4.833333333333333	3.125	28	1	6	5	34	36000	6.0	3.5	2.0	7.0	6.0	4.857	2.571	2.143	4.571	2	train	735	Neutral	2.083333333333333	1.0416666666666667	2.083333333333333	4.166666666666667	4.166666666666667	0.0	1.0416666666666667

If we just worked things out correctly we would be better off.	1.0	6.125	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	2	train	854	Disgust/Sadness	5.88235294117647	4.411764705882352	4.411764705882352	7.352941176470588	8.823529411764705	1.4705882352941175	1.4705882352941175

202	31	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	1.5	3.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	201	Disgust/Sadness	3.90625	3.125	3.125	5.46875	6.25	4.6875	3.125

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.

She was wondering with no coat probaly cold and very scared. I am very thankful that these officers found her before something bad happened to her.

Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others.  When do these people fight back?  When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate?  Other countries have done it.  Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side.

172	400	So, I just read an article about a baby rhino that passed away in captivity; apparently, due to lack of power?

221	417	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	4.0	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	720	Neutral/Sadness	4.761904761904762	2.7210884353741496	8.16326530612245	2.7210884353741496	9.523809523809524	4.081632653061225	2.0408163265306123
216	247	This one sort of gets to me.  The article humanizes the tragedy very clearly, focusing on the one man who lost his daughter, or the individual people who experienced the attacks.  I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.  Awful to live with.	5.833333333333333	3.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	715	Neutral/Sadness	4.895104895104895	3.4965034965034967	6.993006993006993	4.195804195804196	6.993006993006993	2.097902097902098	2.097902097902098
480	53	I think that food waste is a large problem.  I think that American's are lucky to be in position of  having more food than they need, but we do need to start thinking about the environment.

313	291	Hi Nora:   Did you see the article this morning where the handler let his police dog die in a hot car in Arkansas?   The dog's name was Lina and he died Friday.   The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

111	45	This conflict is a mess but I also don't really care about it.  These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	1.3333333333333333	2.25	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	110	Anger/Neutral	6.716417910447761	2.238805970149253	7.462686567164178	2.238805970149253	5.970149253731343	1.4925373134328357	2.238805970149253

So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me.

They shoot anyone who refuses to help. The story has made me upset to read. There is so much evil and suffering in the world, I wish it would end.	5.5	2.25	7	1	2	5	29	44000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	1	train	259	Anger/Sadness	7.692307692307692	3.846153846153846	7.692307692307692	5.769230769230769	9.615384615384617	1.923076923076923	0.0
291	242	I hate hearing about American troop deaths.  I feel sad for the Captain and First Sergeant who died.  Those are experienced and high-ranking people.  I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died.  I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected.  We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan.  You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them.  It doesn't work that way.  Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars.  When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won.  They just keep going.  And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death.	4.166666666666667	5.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	790	Anger/Sadness	13.043478260869566	7.82608695652174	18.260869565217394	3.4782608695652177	12.173913043478262	4.347826086956522	2.608695652173913

433	13	It id very troubling how many innocent people are dying from events that did not need to happen. The air stroke that struck the wrong area and accidentlally hit a hospital killing dozens really seems sketchy. There is no regard for human life and that is truly scary.

241	19	A just read a piece about the refugee crisis circa 2016. I'm wondering how many of the one million that Germany promised to provide asylum to are currently living in Germany. I know that this mass migration of refugees is part of the reason for the rise of nationalistic/fascist sentiment in a lot of places. I fear things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.	4.833333333333333	4.125	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	740	Fear/Neutral	1.4492753623188408	0.0	4.347826086956522	5.797101449275363	7.246376811594203	2.8985507246376816	0.0

374	367	It's very difficult to fathom living somewhere where airstrikes can take you out at any given moment, regardless of where you are.  It really makes me grateful to live in this beautiful nation where we live, America, and to have the freedoms that we have.  In this story, the man's eight children lost their father and his wife lost her partner.  That is very tragic, and all for a bunch of senseless killing.  The US was supporting these airstrikes which is sort of sad.  I find the whole situation over there so senseless.  IT's like they are all just killing each other nonstop for no valid reason.	2.5	1.5	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	373	Joy/Sadness	4.672897196261682	2.803738317757009	5.607476635514018	4.672897196261682	6.5420560747663545	1.8691588785046729	0.0
