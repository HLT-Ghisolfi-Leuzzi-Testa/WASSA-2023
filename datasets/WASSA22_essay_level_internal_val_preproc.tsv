It really raises a good question for me and a lot of people, which is: when do we consider a life to begin? As for me, I consider life to begin when a human takes his or her first breath. Possibly a religious thing, I guess -- my parents and grandparents and entire family believed the same. But because there is no unified belief system as to this issue, I find it difficult to form an opinion as to how people should be prosecuted when a fetus is harmed. I really wish there were one answer to this problem.	sadness	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	118	1486	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.12	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.043478260869565216	2.946936325943397	2.798039196006598	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

They also probably lived a life many of us can only dream about. This might sound wrong, but I will probably forget about this in 5 minutes. Life goes on.

It is heartbreaking to know people out there are in poverty, but especially to know that our war veterans are treated this way.	sadness	2	4	1	29	79000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	74	1519	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.0967741935483871	0.12903225806451613	0.1935483870967742	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.1111111111111111	3.347459549965058	3.168608240797677	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 79000$.

He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2	6	1	28	44000	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	155	1527	0.0	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.047619047619047616	0.19047619047619047	0.043478260869565216	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830313	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000$.

I pray that God gives them all peace and comfort during this time.	sadness	2	6	1	28	77000	6.5	6.0	5.5	6.5	3.0	4.571000000000001	1.429	4.0	5.0	81	1535	0.12195121951219512	0.07317073170731707	0.12195121951219512	0.14634146341463414	0.04878048780487805	0.14634146341463414	0.12195121951219512	0.07317073170731707	0.04878048780487805	0.0975609756097561	0.2	3.0640732963469333	2.846715175480888	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 77000$.

My stepdad worked at a power plant and there was some small explosion and three people died. One of them was the father of a guy I knew from school. I had heard his head was crushed. It was very disturbing imagery and it has stuck with me since. I worry about my husband working in a dangerous job, too, but it seems generally a lot of guys working in these places aren't following safety rules and that's how the accidents happen.	sadness	2	6	1	35	38000	6.0	4.0	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.571	2.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	96	1536	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.13636363636363635	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.7331788859438126	2.5780136686599864	medium	low	An essay written by a 35 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 38000$.

I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.

They went to a theme park to enjoy themselves and their parents were killed in front of them. It was a water ride, the kind that seats six at a time. Something mechanical happened on the ride. The maintenance check a few days prior was good, but something screwed up. There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad. I would hate to see my family members die in front of me in a tragic accident like that.	sadness	1	5	4	40	70000	5.5	5.5	2.0	6.5	5.5	3.857	1.857	2.714	3.286	149	1541	0.125	0.10416666666666667	0.08333333333333333	0.10416666666666667	0.041666666666666664	0.10416666666666667	0.16666666666666666	0.125	0.0625	0.08333333333333333	0.07692307692307693	2.7556213918709798	2.6627024316443912	low	medium	An essay written by a 40 years old native american or american indian male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 70000$.

I am so grateful that the people there set aside a special time to remember all the victims and their families. Such a senseless loss. People just wanting to enjoy some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were forced to wait in pain to hear news of the outcome. I am sure they will never forget that day.  I do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones.	sadness	2	6	6	42	75000	7.0	3.0	3.0	6.5	5.0	3.857	2.714	2.857	4.143	103	1551	0.10526315789473684	0.07017543859649122	0.10526315789473684	0.08771929824561403	0.07017543859649122	0.14035087719298245	0.17543859649122806	0.12280701754385964	0.03508771929824561	0.08771929824561403	0.11538461538461539	3.1592172439355517	2.900598129404273	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

No doubt they have every reason – the young women and girls feel veil-less freedom!  The IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country. The number of women in power is small, and women feel conflicted between what society says they should do and what they want to do. After all, many have aspirations besides raising kids. Who says that the 'house-mom' idea is right? The gender gap needs to close, and the wage gap. Women are not paid as much as men. That's a fact.	sadness	1	6	1	26	63000	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.714	1.286	4.428999999999999	4.714	110	1576	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.36363636363636365	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	2.6658610189203977	2.5871325905154263	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 63000$.

It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter.

From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.

Being a minority myself, I feel for the Muslims and others who faced terrible treatment just because of their heritage. I hope you don't have to experience these terrible things as they have. I would be really careful who you talk to just to be on the safe side.

It gives us the opportunity to learn and see them up close but at the same time its hard to handle the fact that these animals might be feeling pain.

The stress and fear that is being shown from the younger generation is mostly to blame on social media. We used to be able to discuss political issues in person, calmly.

From the shooter, to the local government, these actions should be condemned on all fronts. The government was wrong to arrest the deceased, and the murderer was of course wrong for shooting him to death . I am saddened that someone lost his life because of his charge of a charged message. While I do feel glad that apparent justice will be served in this case, this just goes to show you how violent some people can become when you toss religious ideals into the mix.	sadness	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	111	1614	0.2	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.28888888888888886	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.022222222222222223	0.045454545454545456	2.964130315479896	3.0560530596495203	low	medium	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.

The article mainly talked about E-rate, a government program to subsidize the Internet and broadband access. It said that most classrooms are now connected, but the millions of dollars are still being spent. The program seemed to be wasting a lot of money and wasn't showing good results. I agree that just buying computers and being on the Internet doesn't guarantee that kids are receiving a good education.	neutral	2	6	1	39	21600	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	86	1616	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.2	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.11764705882352941	2.6295257813501833	2.487605835112237	low	low	An essay written by a 39 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600$.

They will harm someone and themselves with or without access to a gun. This murder/suicide was clearly not done by a gun. There are so many situations where a murderer will kill themselves after they have harmed someone else, proving that they are very disturbed and they should have received help of some sort. This will prevent them from harming innocent people along with themselves.	neutral	2	6	1	33	75000	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	87	1617	0.21875	0.1875	0.0	0.03125	0.03125	0.0625	0.25	0.15625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.800733338690726	2.928312981446632	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

These animals should be properly cared for, and perhaps some of the financing could come from fines imposed upon the people who illegally absconded with them in the first place.	neutral	1	4	1	64	27000	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	75	1632	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.14285714285714285	0.09523809523809523	0.09523809523809523	0.0	2.816559210068297	2.821990804475546	low	medium	An essay written by a 64 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

It indicated that Trump had a simple appeal to the darker side of people, the look out for myself and not others side, it explored Trump's ability to partner with those that are hurting and feel left out of society through lack of jobs, etc.  He used this association to promote his agenda, with simple phrases that were easy to remember, and tailored it to the good old boy network.  The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.	neutral	2	6	1	58	40000	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	101	1633	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	2.8951016143521615	2.5406413421720173	medium	low	An essay written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added.

I'm assuming they just broke in and then used tear gas on the couple? How did they escape from the masked men? Or did the masked guys just steal stuff and then leave?

Some terrorist could walk into anywhere and just start shooting the place up. It's terrible what the United States has become. The only way I see to limit terrorism is to try and limit immigration into the country, but even that doesn't solve things. Seems like if you don't live the right kind of life to someone, whether it's being gay etc., then somebody tries to hurt you.

But, on the other side of the coin, the chances are pretty slim of that happening. Plus, if you think about it, the worst thing that happens, if that were to occur, is that I die and then nothing is my problem anymore. I'm in no rush to die, but if it happens, it happens.

In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening.

I am glad that he didn't lose a leg or anything, but still, that would have been very scary.  All of the sudden, boom, you are hit by a shark.  I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.  I don't think it is really our place to force sharks away, as they live in the water.

They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China. Could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century.	fear	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	113	1706	0.125	0.16666666666666666	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.20833333333333334	0.25	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.0	2.9124431725959923	2.770246749003788	medium	medium	An essay written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	120	1763	0.1282051282051282	0.10256410256410256	0.10256410256410256	0.10256410256410256	0.05128205128205128	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.05128205128205128	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.09523809523809523	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	medium	low	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

There does not seem to be a single good moral politician. It would be impossible to win and position of public office without corruption. This is just another example of more corruption. Why do the biggest low lifes decide to be poloticians? Maybe because they are the type of people that like to lie and cheat there way to money and power.	anger	1	4	1	27	12000	5.0	2.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.143	3.429	2.714	2.571	77	1764	0.029411764705882353	0.11764705882352941	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.23529411764705882	0.058823529411764705	0.14705882352941177	0.058823529411764705	0.0625	2.7532933802288926	2.6872449315290896	low	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 12000$.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	135	1776	0.11428571428571428	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.08571428571428572	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 37 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

I was left wondering why France wanted to dismantle the camp and why the refugees were so angry and against the move. What was really going on here? Were there some other issues that had nothing to do with humanitarian considerations? It seems like there's usually more to the story with refugee stories.	surprise	2	6	1	33	55000	2.5	4.5	2.5	4.0	1.5	2.857	3.429	4.714	3.286	73	1814	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.16	0.08	0.16	0.08	0.08	0.08	0.12	0.15384615384615385	2.6460366520574987	2.4046190747092724	medium	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

Imagine if you could go back home and go to sleep at halftime of the Super Bowl and then come back the next day and play the second half. Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously. When I watched Lebron crush the Raptors I was kind of curious as to how they slept knowing a game was coming up.

He was the epitome of the starving writer, it seems. His popularity continued to grow as he aged, and he was able to reap some rewards, but it didn't really catch up with his needs until recent years. He was a Buddhist monk, too. Had no idea. He clearly raised the bar in song writing.	joy	2	7	1	62	5500	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	75	1848	0.0	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.45454545454545453	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.6111603007234945	2.3957445947858798	medium	low	An essay written by a 62 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 5500$.

He lived on berries and stuff. I think I could survive in the woods like that. I know a lot about native plants so I would do pretty good. Of course as long as it wasn't some place cold. The jungle would be hard but only if there are wild animals that would like to eat you for their food. At least the weather would be better.	joy	2	2	1	63	35000	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	90	1850	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.11538461538461539	0.19230769230769232	0.07692307692307693	0.2692307692307692	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.19230769230769232	0.07142857142857142	2.5643622520283733	2.318742710806486	low	low	An essay written by a 63 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000$.
