Someone hit a trailer that was pulling people on a highway. Several people were injured, but three were killed. Authorities say that the three killed were related to one another. That is so sad and breaks my heart. It was most likely a family, a mother and her kids, or a father and his kids. It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened. The article did not say if the driver who caused the accident was drunk or on drugs. I wish people were more alert while on the road. Accidents like this are completely preventable.

There is a huge number of deaths due to hazing in Indonesia. All driven by over-industrialisation and hunger of profits. Governments and scientists should do more to prevent these kinds of deaths: at least to have certain warning systems installed. Also, natural disasters such as hails and typhoons can wreck a havoc in peoples’ lives. Now I have second thoughts about traveling to South Pasific islands.

We usually think of human trafficking involving the kidnapping or sudden disappearance of a person. I just read about two pre-teen girls in Burma who were sent to work to help their family. Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay. My heart broke for them and for their parents. What’s even worse, the police ignored the parents’ request for intervention with no success.
