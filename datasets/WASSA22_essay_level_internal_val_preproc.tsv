They rely on water as a way of life. They have animals that need water. I don’t really know what can be done. Maybe we should address climate change. It is definitely happening.	sadness	1	6	5	31	40000	4.5	4.0	1.0	3.0	2.5	3.0	3.714	3.714	2.714	59	1486.0	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.8259317685768144	2.647381824104706	An essay written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	sadness	2	5	2	41	60000	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	81	1488.0	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.23529411764705882	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.08333333333333333	2.51888015678584	2.499289970764298	An essay written by a 41 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000$.

While California passed clean water acts to remedy this, it has had trouble providing for the poor in unincorporated areas such as Methany Tract (sp?).  But California has recognized that having access to clean water is a right for all people.  Currently they are working on having a nearby city help provide clean water to the Methany Tract citizens.  It really makes one wonder about all the damage already done, the health problems, the children, and it makes one wonder how many other places and other states need to have this resolved.	sadness	2	6	1	58	40000	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	108	1495.0	0.0	0.03225806451612903	0.0967741935483871	0.25806451612903225	0.0	0.2903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.22580645161290322	0.05263157894736842	3.0185358322640456	2.6814993052335363	An essay written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

These young men were out doing something they absolutely loved and doing it with their closest friends, and now they don't have the opportunity to grow old and continue to enjoy many more things to come. They were so young and had their whole lives ahead of them. I can't imagine how their families are feeling right now. Hug your little ones a little tighter tonight.	sadness	2	5	1	37	29999	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.714	4.143	5.0	97	1520.0	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.19047619047619047	0.11904761904761904	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.023809523809523808	0.14285714285714285	0.2	3.1694231073325607	3.043384362289024	An essay written by a 37 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 29999$.

They used the personal stories of a couple of people to show how the ready availability of guns contributes to sad situations in which kids are shot and killed. It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident. The author concludes by calling for more active challenges to the NRA and the second amendment	sadness	1	6	1	47	30000	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	149	1521.0	0.1724137931034483	0.15517241379310345	0.06896551724137931	0.10344827586206896	0.08620689655172414	0.10344827586206896	0.15517241379310345	0.08620689655172414	0.017241379310344827	0.05172413793103448	0.030303030303030304	2.8605179766991067	2.7176623687840173	An essay written by a 47 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

I am very saddened by the turmoil in the middle east. Often I think about how we got here and why it got so bad and blame the powerful and privileged countries, including mine, have caused these conflicts. It feels like it will never end, a hopeless situation. I feel powerless to help anyone over there myself, I can only vote here and hope for the best in the end.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists.

Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.	sadness	2	6	5	33	51000	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	145	1552.0	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.041666666666666664	2.883141101795506	2.6395763754432755	An essay written by a 33 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000$.

However, I am glad that the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group and the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign set up a reward to catch whoever did that. I was also happy to see that it was an immediate response, not a delayed one. It's sad that people won't come forward on their own to bring justice and that there has to be a monetary incentive.	sadness	2	6	1	34	65000	6.5	3.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	3.0	3.571	1.286	2.4290000000000003	83	1555.0	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.26666666666666666	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.1875	2.4342039130897897	2.4004294287671155	An essay written by a 34 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

I felt sorry since she was often attacked for not only political reasons but her appearance also. She was unattractive and somewhat manly looking and the media used that against her. Made fun of her. This article mentions an encounter with Eleanor Roosevelt and her looks remind me of Janet. So maybe that is why she took the post.

Someone hit a trailer that was pulling people on a highway. Several people were injured, but three were killed. Authorities say that the three killed were related to one another. That is so sad and breaks my heart. It was most likely a family, a mother and her kids, or a father and his kids. It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened. The article did not say if the driver who caused the accident was drunk or on drugs. I wish people were more alert while on the road. Accidents like this are completely preventable.

I think the more people see, read and share this info, the bigger the chance to find her identity and family, imagine if it was someone you knew.	sadness	2	5	2	41	60000	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	85	1570.0	0.0	0.0	0.20833333333333334	0.20833333333333334	0.16666666666666666	0.20833333333333334	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.20833333333333334	0.1111111111111111	3.163551695142842	2.7876391203932855	An essay written by a 41 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000$.

Not having any recourse for so long, no one doing anything to right the wrongs, just feeling like it's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so long and happen to so many people.

Some of them did not want to leave and now they can't get out at all. There are barely any medical services at all. Hardly anything to help with all the old age medical conditions that show up later in life. These people don't have enough food. They are scared they will die alone. I don't think many people have thought about this. I am so heartbroken for those people. I wish I could help them. Syria is such a mess. I pray somehow this can all come to a end soon. Too many deaths have occurred. These older people never thought they would have to live like this. Everything was normal until the war for them.  I think more people need to know about the older people living in Syria. They are just left there to suffer.	sadness	2	2	1	36	91000	5.5	6.0	6.0	6.5	4.5	4.0	2.714	3.286	4.857	154	1573.0	0.15384615384615385	0.02564102564102564	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.05128205128205128	0.10256410256410256	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.05128205128205128	0.05128205128205128	0.043478260869565216	2.737493581909863	2.569791795050914	An essay written by a 36 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 91000$.

These people know the dangers that they face when they do this, so it is hard to feel very sorry for them. I don't think giving them more information on these dangers will stop them, but patrolling the waters and turning these human traffickers back will.

You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.  Or even those areas that rely on tourism, if people can’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches.  Not sure what the answer is, or if there even is an answer to it.

There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression.

It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals.

I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	120	1636.0	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.0752753371419286	2.907461098664972	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution.

Us as a society need to do a better job of protecting and helping not only our planet, but the animals and mammals that surround it. The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.	fear	1	4	1	26	35000	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	107	1671.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.854831722181132	2.85783810994379	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000$.

That’s the way another arbovirus, chikungunya works, he wrote in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases last year. “The rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we’re heading, within a year or two, to achieve sufficient herd immunity for this virus to die out,	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	117	1674.0	0.10344827586206896	0.034482758620689655	0.10344827586206896	0.13793103448275862	0.06896551724137931	0.1724137931034483	0.20689655172413793	0.06896551724137931	0.034482758620689655	0.06896551724137931	0.045454545454545456	2.396457733118806	2.313047502507231	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly.

The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	1680.0	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.0	0.16129032258064516	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

It was gruesome to hear one man's account of the story.  He said the shootings went on for 3 hours, and when stopped, it was only so they could load more ammunition and fire more.  I couldn't help but think about the people out in the crowd who where hit and killed.  It's disturbing just imagining that scene and the terror.  And then one man, George Salines, got a call no one would want.  That his daughter was among the 130 killed.  The loss has affected his whole life, he left his job and everything.  In one moment, anyone can be affected by severe tragedy.	fear	5	7	3	34	100000	5.5	4.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	1.857	2.857	4.143	127	1686.0	0.19230769230769232	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.2692307692307692	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.0	2.745120334409751	2.8173400335941516	An essay written by a 34 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

Timeshare salesmen are so pushy when you first sign up for one I can't imagine how hard it is to get out of one. I'm just glad that I don't have a timeshare and never will.

The first of these being, truly, we cannot legislate thought itself. Either we champion free speech for those we find abhorrent, or we stop pretending to care about liberty. People will always suck. At a certain point, it seems we as a society have gotten a lot softer, even as life has become more comfortable. Racists are morons. Do I walk around stressed all day about racists?

It sounds better for their employees.	anger	2	5	6	31	62000	6.0	4.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.857	2.714	3.571	4.571000000000001	107	1771.0	0.125	0.09375	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.15625	0.09375	0.09375	0.0625	0.125	0.1875	2.657108493741895	2.7245438929157624	An essay written by a 31 years old female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000$.

It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go. Anyways, you should really read this article. I told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed, so go read it.	anger	1	6	1	34	40000	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	143	1773.0	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.12903225806451613	0.1935483870967742	0.06451612903225806	0.16129032258064516	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.9289554973030567	2.763764590920136	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

If they have put their time and heart into a place that place is their home.	disgust	1	6	1	32	85000	6.0	3.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	3.286	2.0	3.857	4.0	71	1787.0	0.15789473684210525	0.10526315789473684	0.05263157894736842	0.15789473684210525	0.0	0.10526315789473684	0.21052631578947367	0.10526315789473684	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.0	2.780984736271026	2.579970608658959	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 85000$.

It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

With that being said, I don't think it is correct to shun your child from having a different belief as you. Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me.

After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida.

Is it always the fault of big business and government to allow things to go wrong as the case with diseases coconut and the potential that they cannot be saved.    Are we not smart enough to ensure that before something disappears from the face of the earth, that we find a way to correct it, protect it, live with it.  What happens when we run out of coconuts.

Perhaps it felt threatened? Maybe it was abused? Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way. I can't imagine another reason than that.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	116	1845.0	0.06666666666666667	0.08888888888888889	0.08888888888888889	0.06666666666666667	0.044444444444444446	0.2222222222222222	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.15555555555555556	0.05	2.7570415470565877	2.389435536663511	An essay written by a 30 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

I think that the legacy he left behind is amazing, and he will continue to influence us even after his death. I would love to see Arnold Palmer's compnay thrive tremendously over the next couple of decades, and continue to transpire within the people he has influenced in his life.	joy	1	4	3	19	50000	4.5	6.5	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.571	2.714	3.286	3.0	81	1855.0	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.041666666666666664	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.07142857142857142	2.7511476294355757	2.5926616603174018	An essay written by a 19 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

In the beginning I wrote about how our friendship began, and wrote about all of my favorite memories with her from as far back as I could remember. Our first interaction to when we first started texting and getting to know each other, all the way up to when I wrote the letter. She is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how grateful she is to have me as a friend. I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me. I made the end of the letter forward looking and wrote of how grateful I considered myself to be because she was in my life, and how I hoped that wouldn’t change for a long, long time.	joy	1	4	3	28	456566	4.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	2.4290000000000003	3.571	2.571	3.0	150	1856.0	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.2647058823529412	0.14705882352941177	0.058823529411764705	0.29411764705882354	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.0	0.17647058823529413	0.1111111111111111	2.9720048395187972	2.7761004849593856	An essay written by a 28 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 456566$.

While at the same time in America there are parents who actively keep their children from getting them.  Their should be social consequences in place the parents who intentionally endanger their children like this.  I would think a hefty tax that goes to implementing vaccines in impoverished areas would be a great idea.	joy	1	6	1	34	99000	7.0	5.5	4.0	5.5	7.0	4.143	1.0	2.286	2.714	74	1857.0	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.3076923076923077	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.0	2.889819201570161	2.914368887304775	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 99000$.

It is about how Democrats will move forward in the next few years to get legoslation moving. It has been hard with Trump in the White House for the whole country, but imagine being a democrat right now trying to push legislation that your constituents are asking about? What a time to be alive! We should all just try to make the country a lot better right now!	joy	2	5	2	41	60000	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	95	1858.0	0.0	0.0	0.25	0.125	0.125	0.375	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	2.737038964666429	2.60588275340506	An essay written by a 41 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000$.

He lived on berries and stuff. I think I could survive in the woods like that. I know a lot about native plants so I would do pretty good. Of course as long as it wasn't some place cold. The jungle would be hard but only if there are wild animals that would like to eat you for their food. At least the weather would be better.	joy	2	2	1	63	35000	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	90	1859.0	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.11538461538461539	0.19230769230769232	0.07692307692307693	0.2692307692307692	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.19230769230769232	0.07142857142857142	2.5643622520283733	2.318742710806486	An essay written by a 63 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000$.
