I do believe she was very aware that her flying career had inherent risks that could ultimately cause her death. It angers and saddens me that people would undermine her role a female fighter pilot by making rude remarks stating there are other more accomplished women flyers.	sadness	2	6	1	46	52000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	3.714	4.428999999999999	65	1486	0.1111111111111111	0.08333333333333333	0.1388888888888889	0.027777777777777776	0.08333333333333333	0.2222222222222222	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	2.998152773480429	2.8290889427163033	medium	medium	An essay about the article 150, written by a 46 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 52000$.

According to UNICEF, there is a simple vaccine that can be given, which would stop children from being affected.  It affects most children in poor countries, which is very sad.  The vaccine isn’t that expensive and you would think that the leaders of all countries would get together and do something about this problem.  It is not just up to the USA to stand up and do something.  These other countries (even though they are poor) need to get more educated and help protect their own children and citizens in their own country.  It is sad that children and others have to die because we can’t coordinate with each other, to get the vaccines to those who need it most.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	136	1493	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay about the article 126, written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

That means that anyone can be blamed for missing the signs and its too hard to tell when someone will actually commit to killing themselves even when they are making empty threats.	sadness	2	5	1	37	46000	6.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	4.5	4.2860000000000005	2.286	3.714	4.0	85	1517	0.21052631578947367	0.21052631578947367	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.21052631578947367	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.0	3.018968656500646	3.093961373131844	low	low	An essay about the article 281, written by a 37 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 46000$.

It is not justified to use violence against anyone who has not initiated violence towards you.  That being said I understand why the authorities would want to ban people who practice risky lifestyles from donating blood.  The last thing we want is to have a blood supply that's contaminated with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in risky lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well.  No violence should never be the answer to people no matter what their lifestyle, But one should never condone something that is bad for society in the long run.	sadness	1	2	3	36	150000	6.5	5.5	4.5	7.0	6.5	4.714	2.0	2.857	4.714	111	1520	0.225	0.15	0.075	0.0	0.0	0.075	0.25	0.15	0.075	0.0	0.0	2.8666993498330817	2.8788514060401225	low	low	An essay about the article 140, written by a 36 years old black or african american male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 150000$.

Haiti has been brutalized by mother nature, and the Clintons, and people are trying to get somehwere to survive while the country recovers. The U.S. let's them in to ship them back out and that is a bit ridiculous. It's not a situation where those from Mexico just sneak over and hide from society.

The state needs an injection of capital to help individuals and small businesses get their feet back underneath them, and providing the foundation of the local economies to not only sustain themselves and thrive.	sadness	1	6	1	29	140000	6.5	4.5	3.0	4.5	4.0	3.571	2.286	3.286	3.571	81	1582	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.2	0.0	0.2	0.2	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.0	3.1635091793301506	2.8822029009736934	medium	medium	An essay about the article 232, written by a 29 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 140000$.

First of all, the zoo was horrid. Less than 20 animals remained of the hundreds that had been previously housed here. The rescue of the animals occurred under rather harrowing conditions with Hamas and Israeli forces launching missles during the evacuation process. It sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species. They will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the wild. Let me know what you think.	sadness	2	6	1	66	75000	5.5	4.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	3.571	2.4290000000000003	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	106	1583	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.08333333333333333	0.125	0.125	0.20833333333333334	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.11764705882352941	2.8388532919539413	2.6101466382396734	low	low	An essay about the article 57, written by a 66 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

We only see things from our side of the pond, and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do, as a country.

There are plenty of people in Afghanistan who are against eh taliban, and we dont see the damage that we are doing by hitting them with drone strikes.  Most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the conflict itself.  There are always conflicting stories about the death tolls.

The economic crisis that is happening there is not only affecting people, but also the animals that live there. Especially in the zoos. We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos.

It seems that human nature is causing these animals to be subjected to lives they shouldn't have to endure. If they were released into nature then maybe they would have a fighting chance but at the same time, most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their ""social skills"" in nature may be quite the detriment as well. I just wish that some organization(s) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be.

I do take comfort in knowing that's what he wanted to do and he died following what he wants.	sadness	1	5	5	31	80000	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	5.0	1.571	3.0	4.571000000000001	68	1596	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.09090909090909091	2.991484303738531	2.7906362467755876	medium	medium	An essay about the article 42, written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 80000$.

He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2	6	1	28	44000	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	155	1598	0.0	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.047619047619047616	0.19047619047619047	0.043478260869565216	2.809772459983027	2.5532860103830313	medium	low	An essay about the article 73, written by a 28 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000$.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	107	1675	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	low	low	An essay about the article 120, written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

A report I read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix! Well, it certainly is concerning to me! The report, released this month, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand supposedly the hub of the global Fairtrade system. I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply. Well, knowing how you love your coffee just as much as I do, I just knew this would fascinate you!

No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim.

Why do people even care if someone gave birth by C section instead of natural birth anyway.	anger	2	6	1	36	105000	6.5	5.0	1.0	6.0	5.0	5.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	4.2860000000000005	69	1725	0.11764705882352941	0.0	0.14705882352941177	0.17647058823529413	0.029411764705882353	0.23529411764705882	0.029411764705882353	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.20588235294117646	0.07692307692307693	2.7692877372895417	2.623132427490583	low	low	An essay about the article 221, written by a 36 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 105000$.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	135	1737	0.11428571428571428	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.08571428571428572	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay about the article 27, written by a 37 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"" when she said Latinos and Muslims are facing harassment. ""And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools. It was a powerful appeal to a nation ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign.

When you give a group something, even if it doesn't belong to them and even if you're being kind my doing it, they immediately feel like it belongs to them and will react strongly if you try to take it away.	anger	1	5	1	34	30000	4.5	6.0	3.0	5.5	4.5	4.0	2.0	3.857	3.857	80	1773	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.23529411764705882	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.08333333333333333	2.628634984234623	2.5703042792183264	low	medium	An essay about the article 136, written by a 34 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 30000$.

The United States has had military influence in the Middle East for way too long, and we were deceived by President Obama at the time he started office. He stated he would pull all troops out, but that never really happened. The troops may have decreased, but we have a strong presence there still.	anger	2	6	1	33	75000	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	84	1774	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.0	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.38835243246981	2.275911712226688	low	low	An essay about the article 175, written by a 33 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

I believe most police officers are good people, but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many police departments. The protests were certainly justified. Police should be subjected to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism.

They could sue the developers, but no amount of money is going to compensate them for the health issues these kids are going to experience due to lead poisoning. The worst thing about this is, if it were a wealthy white neighbourhood adjacent to the industrial site they wanted to demolish, you know they would have taken every precaution to test to see if there was any chance of releasing toxic amounts of lead into the vicinity. But it's a poor black neighbourhood, so of course they aren't as careful.	disgust	2	6	5	28	65000	6.0	7.0	3.0	3.0	3.5	2.714	3.0	3.714	3.143	100	1805	0.0	0.09375	0.09375	0.09375	0.09375	0.21875	0.15625	0.09375	0.0625	0.09375	0.058823529411764705	3.032693689729871	2.941020935965556	medium	medium	An essay about the article 194, written by a 28 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1	6	5	31	75000	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	115	1808	0.10714285714285714	0.21428571428571427	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.25	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay about the article 225, written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

I mean I know you're a big gold fan, so I understand how this is upsetting you. I will send you more articles about him later on today so we can talk more about him. What do you think? Who do you think was better? Jack or Arnold? What about tiger? Either way, I hope you get this article and it helps lift your spirits a bit. I cannot really connect to the article since I am not a big golf person, but I still think we should honor the man.	surprise	1	6	2	33	109000	6.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	4.857	157	1838	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.1875	0.09375	0.28125	0.0625	0.03125	0.0	0.125	0.07407407407407407	2.720422443657355	2.4350625318441663	medium	low	An essay about the article 62, written by a 33 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 109000$.

After reading this story, it's hard to feel sympathetic, even in retrospect. But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2	6	1	59	25500	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	113	1855	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.34782608695652173	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.21739130434782608	0.14285714285714285	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156658	low	low	An essay about the article 115, written by a 59 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500$.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	150	1856	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.20833333333333334	0.20833333333333334	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay about the article 84, written by a 26 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000$.

Hopefully they'll get it repaired soon though and things will go back to normal. At least there wasn't severe environmental damage, that's a good thing.
