They should not be hunted down as trophies. I feel pleased that the security forces are trying to protect wildlife. I am also happy that rhino poaching is a crime that will help to protect the noncancerous. It hurts to know they hunt the animals just for their horns. That is sheer cruelty, not because they cannot talk but they do have feelings and should be allowed to live wild and free.	sadness	2	6	1	38	59000	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	3.143	4.714	4.857	92	1486.0	0.14	0.08	0.0	0.16	0.02	0.16	0.1	0.08	0.02	0.12	0.25	3.000001652704397	2.7502532722868587	"It is sad that they cannot stop poaching.

How sad that those people died for what appears to be just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	sadness	2	6	1	28	44000	6.5	6.5	6.0	6.5	6.0	4.714	2.286	3.857	4.857	155	1568.0	0.14	0.08	0.0	0.16	0.02	0.16	0.1	0.08	0.02	0.12	0.25	3.000001652704397	2.7502532722868587	"I just read an article about how Billy Bob Thorton felt about his marriage to Angelia Jolie.

Sometimes I still cannot believe that we lived through 9/11, especially because before that I had never even heard the word terrorism or knew what a terrorist attack was. And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people.

I thought it sounded pretty funny. The article described some of the ways people are protesting, from covering the star with graffiti, to putting a Bernie Sanders sticker on it, to putting a barbed wire fence around it.
