Can you imagine how big the fire must be to spread so far and wide? And the people in the area obviously suffer the most.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	136	1492	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

How sad that those people died for what appears to be just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

My husband is a US Army soldier that fought to take over Mosul the first time at the cost of many lives.  And through incompetent measures in our government and military, we let go of Mosul and are again trying to figure out a way to take it back.  It makes me sad that there are people being oppressed in the world but it is also clear to me that at what cost do we fight the oppressors and pick a whose side to be on.  Maybe we should worry about ourselves stateside and stay out of the mess in the middle east.	sadness	2	6	1	42	75000	5.5	4.5	5.0	3.0	3.5	3.571	2.286	3.429	2.857	112	1504	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.21739130434782608	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.0	2.9336311653669185	2.867076307171067	An essay written by a 42 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

I guess that several years ago, the government came up with this program to get internet and technology in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet. However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do.

It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through.

I cannot imagine what the Afghan family members are going through or what the families of the Americans here are going through. It is such a great loss.  This war has got to end soon. I know that the US troops are just trying to help the Afghanis but there are so many things that go on during these battles. I pray an end comes soon.	sadness	2	6	6	42	75000	7.0	3.0	3.0	6.5	5.0	3.857	2.714	2.857	4.143	85	1519	0.3076923076923077	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.1	2.913441551835877	2.5544870265190807	An essay written by a 42 years old female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

I wish that we would just do something once and for all to help save  these people from such suffering. I guess in the mean time all that I can do personally is just pray for the people though and hope that soon things will get better, somehow.

And especially when there were children on board? Such a senseless act. How scared those individuals and the victim must have been when that was happening. It is a good thing that that guy was there to help the passengers get off the bus. A tragic event would have been even more tragic had he not been there to save those people. I feel bad because those individuals (including the guy who saved the passengers) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same. Their lives have been turned upside down because of someone else's senseless act and are forever traumatized by it. I hope those victims get the support they need and I hope that the driver's family receives support	sadness	2	6	1	34	65000	6.5	3.0	2.0	6.5	3.5	3.0	3.571	1.286	2.4290000000000003	143	1521	0.10638297872340426	0.10638297872340426	0.0851063829787234	0.0851063829787234	0.10638297872340426	0.10638297872340426	0.14893617021276595	0.0851063829787234	0.0851063829787234	0.0851063829787234	0.15789473684210525	2.972923978991221	2.9316096700329224	An essay written by a 34 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

This is pretty upsetting for me as I am in love with these animals. They are wanting to cut down most of the forest. This place is in Indonesia and this company is also planning on building a drainage canal from the north to the south side of the area for which some work has already reportedly began. I really wished there was a way we can help and protect this land. You would have thought that this would be an important area that needed protected.

Sometimes I feel like the people that disagree with scientists and real evidence that global warming is very obvious today is just very ignorant and live in a bubble where they think that everything is fine in the world and everyone is at peace. There are so many reasons why we should be using fewer resources as it is constantly destroying our environment and it is unfortunate that there are people who just continue to deplete our resources without a care in the world. Maybe the effects won't be felt as much in our generation but I am sure that the effects will be felt by those others after us sadly.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	151	1534	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.2702702702702703	0.0	0.21621621621621623	0.16216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.0	2.8851050612555498	2.8665030936928537	An essay written by a 24 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000$.

I feel mostly bad for the birds and sea life, which will obviously be affected.  You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.  Or even those areas that rely on tourism, if people can’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches.  Not sure what the answer is, or if there even is an answer to it.

One part that stuck in my mind is that in one country, the elephants are protected more than they are in the neighboring country. It is odd that an elephant can literally walk away from its protection by wandering into the neighboring country. I was not aware of any of this. The article somewhat jokingly said that elephants do not have passports.	sadness	1	2	1	34	100000	5.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.0	3.0	3.429	3.286	78	1536	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.821241604671469	2.7823136435630738	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 100000$.

Can you imagine what it must be like to flee from something so incredibly dangerous and then lose your life at sea or see people die while you're escaping? I wonder sometimes what must possess refugees to do this. Is there no other way for them to escape? Why do they risk their lives when they know the numbers of people who die in situations like this? It must be awful where they are coming from for them to risk it all. I mean, look at that star soccer player. She was like royalty in her country and a celebrated athlete.

I don't even know what the whole issue was but just to think that just like that your life could be over.  I get that politics is a pretty nasty sport but really when you think about it,  it's quite different around the world then it is here.   People think our current state of the nation is bad,  can you just imagine being in some of these other countries where there seems to be nothing but endless political strife.   I've even seen government members punch each other in meetings in some foreign governments.

Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	141	1554	0.08163265306122448	0.061224489795918366	0.12244897959183673	0.04081632653061224	0.04081632653061224	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.12244897959183673	0.10204081632653061	0.061224489795918366	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

From the shooter, to the local government, these actions should be condemned on all fronts. The government was wrong to arrest the deceased, and the murderer was of course wrong for shooting him to death . I am saddened that someone lost his life because of his charge of a charged message. While I do feel glad that apparent justice will be served in this case, this just goes to show you how violent some people can become when you toss religious ideals into the mix.	sadness	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	111	1558	0.2	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.28888888888888886	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.022222222222222223	0.045454545454545456	2.964130315479896	3.0560530596495203	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.

When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today?

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention. I feel for the little froggies though and hope science can find a way to preserve them and their habitat.	sadness	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	118	1576	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.22727272727272727	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.041666666666666664	3.0733373234461627	2.8491270178866577	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution.

I was just reading this article about a family of 3 young black boys who went through foster care and ended up in prison later on in life, and it made me want to share it with you.  It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter. What do you think?

I wonder if they have relatives that might be willing to take them in. I wish the article had been more informative and told a more comprehensive story about what happened and why the children were spared when three adults were killed. Perhaps there was a spat between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a traumatic incident.

I say good for them. The animals can't fight back, but hopefully the army can deter poachers. I know the poachers do it because they can make a lot of money, but I just don't understand it. Big game hunters/trophy hunters and poachers are one in the same to me. I think they are both ridiculous reasons to harm or kill any animal. The anti-poaching armies have a scary, but, I think, extremely necessary job.	sadness	2	4	3	33	60000	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857	100	1585	0.14705882352941177	0.14705882352941177	0.08823529411764706	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.08823529411764706	0.17647058823529413	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	2.5173461724462487	2.5196251834516903	An essay written by a 33 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	140	1587	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals.

Clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so unbearable that they are willing to risk their own and their families' lives to try for a different life in another country, with no guarantee that life there would be an improvement.  Its difficult to understand.  Life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance, which I suppose is something difficult for the typical American to picture.  I'm glad that we live in a country where there are relative freedoms and the individual and his or her family can live independently and get their needs met and wants.

They should not be hunted down as trophies. I feel pleased that the security forces are trying to protect wildlife. I am also happy that rhino poaching is a crime that will help to protect the noncancerous. It hurts to know they hunt the animals just for their horns. That is sheer cruelty, not because they cannot talk but they do have feelings and should be allowed to live wild and free.	sadness	2	6	1	38	59000	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	3.143	4.714	4.857	92	1602	0.09375	0.125	0.03125	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.15625	0.09375	0.09375	0.09375	0.058823529411764705	3.0735822640430945	3.012195707888009	An essay written by a 38 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 59000$.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through.

They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.

So many of our anti-bullying stories talk about standing up to them and bullying back...that is not the way!	anger	2	7	1	35	80000	7.0	5.5	3.5	7.0	5.5	4.0	1.857	3.857	3.857	86	1722	0.23529411764705882	0.17647058823529413	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.0	0.17647058823529413	0.17647058823529413	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.0	2.9571737496092334	2.9271423921088875	An essay written by a 35 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 80000$.

To me it doesn't really matter as I never even thought about someone being a Jew until I got older. People are people. Jews are smart. Jews have always been smart at least for generations. Smart people make money and are good at business. Just the way it goes. Jew, Jew Jew, I'm sick of all of the Jew hate. OTOH people have a legitimate concern to fear that Trump being elected will cause problems like WW2 did. After all Jews tend to be Republican and likely donated a ton of money to Trump and they are more powerful today than they ever were.

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong.

Only so many resources in this country and unless we want to become another 3rd world country we have to send them home. Make them wait in line just like any other legal immigrant. Why should they be given special privileges to be in this country.

I don't know what's going on but people can't seem to handle themselves and use restraint. People are becoming too short-fused and trigger happy on attacking others with hate crimes. I hope things get better but the article didn't seem too optimistic. I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored.

People are dying, and they need somewhere safe, and all we do is take ten thousand. And let's face it America's hands aren't clean in the middle east, or Africa. America has learned nothing from past wars. We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral. They're just trying to find a safe place, away from the constant threat of death everyday, for themselves and th	anger	2	7	1	55	10000	6.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	6.0	3.571	2.0	3.571	4.143	145	1756	0.07407407407407407	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.018518518518518517	0.18518518518518517	0.12962962962962962	0.05555555555555555	0.09259259259259259	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.8282735275028603	2.8176668600545183	An essay written by a 55 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 10000$.

It was pretty stupid too, I don't get why adults are fighting like high school children. It was all over some petty comments made, which apparently turned to racist slurs and got someone thrown out fo a building. Of course, everything is he said she said so I can't tell who was really wrong in this situation. However, again another situation that shows the stupidity of the human race.	anger	2	4	1	26	14750	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.5	4.428999999999999	2.143	4.857	3.143	83	1757	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	2.567360502114703	2.53795574211349	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 14750$.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons. We seriously need to do something about these conditions.	anger	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	126	1760	0.13043478260869565	0.21739130434782608	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.1	2.887471641540525	2.935960670048317	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

I don't want to make too big a deal about this because it is a different culture and it would be difficult to get the full gist without knowing too much about it.  With that said, it's is pretty worrisome, in this country as well, how much people are telling everyone what they should and shouldn't be doing.  Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.	anger	1	4	1	42	39000	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	103	1762	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.15	0.05	0.3	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.15	0.15789473684210525	2.808354938543694	2.7133308782499603	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000$.

Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here. Let them try living back in Africa and see how they like that.	anger	2	2	1	63	35000	6.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	3.857	1.0	2.0	5.0	116	1773	0.18181818181818182	0.11363636363636363	0.0	0.13636363636363635	0.06818181818181818	0.09090909090909091	0.20454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.022727272727272728	0.0	0.0	2.893788157080626	2.823569269494842	An essay written by a 63 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 35000$.

Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2	6	1	23	65000	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	124	1789	0.05128205128205128	0.10256410256410256	0.10256410256410256	0.1794871794871795	0.07692307692307693	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.02564102564102564	0.10256410256410256	0.05128205128205128	0.041666666666666664	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	An essay written by a 23 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

That unnecessary force was used to handle the situation. Its crazy that the first thing on the police mind is to shoot to kill. I feel uneasy every time seeing and reading about situation like this where a situation could of been handled in a different way.

With that being said, I don't think it is correct to shun your child from having a different belief as you. Children should be able to freely be able to open up a discussion with their parents and analyze their opposing views without worrying if they will receive any type of punishment. I love jokes and pulling pranks, but to do that to your own child and then to publicly embarrass them...well that doesn't seem funny at all to me. It worries me that the child will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for fear of upsetting their parent.	disgust	2	6	3	28	35000	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	113	1791	0.10810810810810811	0.10810810810810811	0.10810810810810811	0.02702702702702703	0.0	0.1891891891891892	0.16216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.08108108108108109	0.13513513513513514	0.0	2.707699326919287	2.7451248417832095	An essay written by a 28 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000$.

It is through supposed weakness that we become stronger.	surprise	1	4	1	34	42000	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.0	4.857	2.714	4.857	5.0	86	1822	0.0625	0.0625	0.09375	0.125	0.03125	0.15625	0.1875	0.15625	0.09375	0.03125	0.0	2.937641114888422	2.750160383510559	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 42000$.

Still, should he be charged with a felony?  My Granny Jones used to make turtle soup out of the snappers they fished out of her creek.

After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

Did you know our coffee crops are in danger of being wiped out? That's right, I just read this article detailing the struggles currently going on with coffee crop farmers. There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going. The warm temperatures have really threw a wrench into their day to day operations and maintaining the coffee crops has become quite a challenge. We are in danger of either paying really high prices on coffee or worse case scenario being without coffee period. This is very distressing for me.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1	3	1	33	58000	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	144	1829	0.03773584905660377	0.09433962264150944	0.1509433962264151	0.20754716981132076	0.09433962264150944	0.16981132075471697	0.05660377358490566	0.05660377358490566	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.06451612903225806	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	An essay written by a 33 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000$.

It makes me wonder if that's where humans get their own ability to problem solve as well.	surprise	1	4	1	45	40000	6.0	4.0	2.5	5.5	6.0	2.143	1.857	3.0	2.4290000000000003	62	1839	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.0	3.076560054785626	2.7336797568895483	An essay written by a 45 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 40000$.

The fact that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more damage, more permanent damage, seems to back that up. It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity?

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	150	1845	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.20833333333333334	0.20833333333333334	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	An essay written by a 26 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000$.
