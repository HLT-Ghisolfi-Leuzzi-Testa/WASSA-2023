I wonder how long the body had been there before he was found. Money was probably the motive since it usually is. He probably got over on him somehow and dude got his revenge.

We usually think of human trafficking involving the kidnapping or sudden disappearance of a person. I just read about two pre-teen girls in Burma who were sent to work to help their family. Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay. My heart broke for them and for their parents. What’s even worse, the police ignored the parents’ request for intervention with no success.

It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter.

I felt compassion for her. I tried to put myself into her shoe and I know I would have broken down and cried. She should have controlled her tongue as well, violence begot violence and a soft answer turns away wrath. Russell is not much of a lady's gentleman he could have dealt with the issue in an amicable manner. Maybe they could just let bygones be bygones and put it behind them. It was rather unfortunate.	sadness	2	6	1	38	59000	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	3.143	4.714	4.857	99	1502	0.1935483870967742	0.16129032258064516	0.0	0.03225806451612903	0.0	0.12903225806451613	0.22580645161290322	0.16129032258064516	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.0	2.5801448095835617	2.574731671566905	low	medium	An essay about the article 69, written by a 38 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 59000$.

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	141	1510	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.041666666666666664	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay about the article 386, written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.

I guess I just do not care, to be frank, about the things happening in Haiti. I don't think others care either. That's where a lot of my focus was, thinking about how others don't care. I think for the most part, people don't generally care about what is happening in other countries. I think Haiti is one of them. I think people have just been forced to care.

That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place. That reminds me of the fire that happened at my neighbors house.	sadness	1	6	1	28	100000	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	149	1523	0.24444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.08888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.08888888888888889	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.08333333333333333	3.0210370860408338	2.9018071502690783	medium	medium	An essay about the article 66, written by a 28 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000$.

Although I am a hopeless romantic and I feel that not every coupling has to be condemned to such a fate as Kate, Len and most Americans have to endure.	sadness	1	4	1	30	30000	6.5	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.0	5.0	2.571	4.714	5.0	79	1534	0.12	0.04	0.12	0.08	0.08	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.12	0.09090909090909091	2.9197414864407714	2.806983288318592	medium	medium	An essay about the article 183, written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 30000$.

I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis. It just makes me worried about the environment overall because I really worry about global warming and I just really worry about the environment in general.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	143	1535	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.125	0.041666666666666664	0.20833333333333334	0.20833333333333334	0.125	0.0	0.041666666666666664	0.034482758620689655	2.7584683114539055	2.5576228803693977	low	low	An essay about the article 332, written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

I think there's a lot more to this story than what the school is reporting.	sadness	2	6	1	58	60000	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	1.714	2.4290000000000003	81	1550	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.06666666666666667	2.6863020070718893	2.4435757509937845	low	low	An essay about the article 399, written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000$.

Some of them did not want to leave and now they can't get out at all. There are barely any medical services at all. Hardly anything to help with all the old age medical conditions that show up later in life. These people don't have enough food. They are scared they will die alone. I don't think many people have thought about this. I am so heartbroken for those people. I wish I could help them. Syria is such a mess. I pray somehow this can all come to a end soon. Too many deaths have occurred. These older people never thought they would have to live like this. Everything was normal until the war for them.  I think more people need to know about the older people living in Syria. They are just left there to suffer.	sadness	2	2	1	36	91000	5.5	6.0	6.0	6.5	4.5	4.0	2.714	3.286	4.857	154	1551	0.15384615384615385	0.02564102564102564	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.05128205128205128	0.10256410256410256	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.05128205128205128	0.05128205128205128	0.043478260869565216	2.737493581909863	2.569791795050914	medium	low	An essay about the article 48, written by a 36 years old white female, with a high-school diploma, with an income of 91000$.

I worry about my husband working in a dangerous job, too, but it seems generally a lot of guys working in these places aren't following safety rules and that's how the accidents happen.	sadness	2	6	1	35	38000	6.0	4.0	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.571	2.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	96	1582	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.13636363636363635	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.0	2.7331788859438126	2.5780136686599864	medium	low	An essay about the article 265, written by a 35 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 38000$.

Clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so unbearable that they are willing to risk their own and their families' lives to try for a different life in another country, with no guarantee that life there would be an improvement.  Its difficult to understand.  Life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance, which I suppose is something difficult for the typical American to picture.  I'm glad that we live in a country where there are relative freedoms and the individual and his or her family can live independently and get their needs met and wants.

It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through. My mom is always worried when I go backpacking and she'd go crazy if anything like this happened to me.	sadness	1	4	1	42	105000	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	154	1590	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.17647058823529413	0.23529411764705882	0.20588235294117646	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.041666666666666664	2.682485542394438	2.5507018080557495	low	low	An essay about the article 42, written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000$.

I feel bad because those individuals (including the guy who saved the passengers) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same. Their lives have been turned upside down because of someone else's senseless act and are forever traumatized by it.

That being said I understand why the authorities would want to ban people who practice risky lifestyles from donating blood.  The last thing we want is to have a blood supply that's contaminated with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in risky lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well.

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too. Somehow we have to figure out better relief efforts for natural disasters.	neutral	2	7	1	62	5500	7.0	7.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	105	1616	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.22580645161290322	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.0	2.9639654974634384	2.622677973711621	medium	low	An essay about the article 35, written by a 62 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 5500$.

They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear.

Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1	7	5	37	30000	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	135	1721	0.11428571428571428	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.08571428571428572	0.02857142857142857	0.02857142857142857	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay about the article 27, written by a 37 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000$.

Here is this man just minding his own business and he's attacked by a bunch of teens on bikes! The kid that threatened him with the bottle was probably just trying to show off to his friends. I mean, this did happen in Scotland but it could've been right in our backyards as well. I think we really need to rethink our commitment to the youth center. I firmly believe that when kids have a place to go and things to do, they are less inclined to get caught up in this kind of mischief!	anger	2	5	1	57	28000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.0	3.857	4.0	112	1744	0.047619047619047616	0.047619047619047616	0.14285714285714285	0.19047619047619047	0.09523809523809523	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	2.6969347435810644	2.7452337224326326	low	medium	An essay about the article 155, written by a 57 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 28000$.

Some may think they are doing good things trying to get people to a better place, but these traffickers do not see people and are wanting to help them.  They see them as money, they take advantage of them and take every single thing they can from them while promising them a better life.  They do not care about the safety of people and are just trying to maximize their profits.

Just having a shocking video that raises awareness doesn't help the problem from starting, just helps us react to it quicker.  We need to keep building programs that are designed to support our children, but we need to do it before they start to bully (or be bullied).

I don't know a lot about conversion therapy, but i'm not so sure that this is the way to go. I also don't believe that trump is anti gay.

Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems."	disgust	2	6	1	39	45000	6.0	5.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	4.2860000000000005	1.714	4.143	4.571000000000001	84	1808	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.0	2.791765169686607	2.616842025335621	low	low	An essay about the article 379, written by a 39 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000$.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

I think that the legacy he left behind is amazing, and he will continue to influence us even after his death. I would love to see Arnold Palmer's compnay thrive tremendously over the next couple of decades, and continue to transpire within the people he has influenced in his life.	joy	1	4	3	19	50000	4.5	6.5	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.571	2.714	3.286	3.0	81	1857	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.041666666666666664	0.25	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.07142857142857142	2.7511476294355757	2.5926616603174018	low	low	An essay about the article 62, written by a 19 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

More of the women they're talking about voted for Trump than Hillary. I guess they never asked women if those allegations bothered them or were important. I know that you told me after the Access Hollywood tapes that you didn't care about that stuff, that policy issues were more important.	joy	1	4	1	42	105000	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	72	1859	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.25	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0	0.0625	0.125	0.125	2.335301233617333	2.2263251719063346	low	low	An essay about the article 268, written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000$.
