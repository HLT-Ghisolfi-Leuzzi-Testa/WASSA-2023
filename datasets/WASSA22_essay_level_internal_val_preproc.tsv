It really raises a good question for me and a lot of people, which is: when do we consider a life to begin? As for me, I consider life to begin when a human takes his or her first breath. Possibly a religious thing, I guess -- my parents and grandparents and entire family believed the same. But because there is no unified belief system as to this issue, I find it difficult to form an opinion as to how people should be prosecuted when a fetus is harmed. I really wish there were one answer to this problem.	sadness	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	118	1553.0														I read an article about a young mother-to-be who lost her twins, prematurely, after being shot in the stomach.

First of all, the zoo was horrid. Less than 20 animals remained of the hundreds that had been previously housed here. The rescue of the animals occurred under rather harrowing conditions with Hamas and Israeli forces launching missles during the evacuation process. It sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species. They will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the wild.

It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern. I am really worried about the outcome for these bears. It is sad to think they may become extinct.	sadness	2	2	1	60	74000	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	154	1600.0														I just read a story about a study being done by a new University of Washington that was funded and the satellite data from NASA, that was about the Arctic Polar Bears.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp.

It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.
