While being a resident of California, this to me is not surprising.  Unfortunately we as a nation need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment.  Even worse is now we have a president who in his own words feel as though global warming is just a fabrication.

I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	sadness	2	5	2	41	60000	6.5	6.0	2.0	6.0	3.5	4.714	3.571	2.0	4.571000000000001	81	1504	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.23529411764705882	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.08333333333333333	2.51888015678584	2.499289970764298	low	low	An essay written by a 41 years old hispanic or latino female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 60000$.

This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong.

The last thing we want is to have a blood supply that's contaminated with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in risky lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well.

Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place.

The drilling is likely what caused it, and the developer should be held responsible. He has caused much pain and suffering. Kenyans deserve better, and since he didn't listen to NCA warnings, he should pay for what he did. The other buildings in the area should be thoroughly tested to see if anything can be done to prevent this.	sadness	1	6	1	31	65000	3.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	3.5	3.143	3.143	2.857	3.0	74	1521	0.19230769230769232	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	2.7877548959069727	2.7379164814574057	low	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

Turkey is constantly at war. I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here.

This article reminds me that no matter how long the case, the family will always wait for them to hug those missing students.	sadness	1	6	1	32	10000	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	5.5	3.429	4.0	2.857	3.286	66	1554	0.13043478260869565	0.08695652173913043	0.17391304347826086	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.2608695652173913	0.21739130434782608	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.0	3.0301066697161176	2.9074032037671254	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 10000$.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will.

You wonder about how they react, and how they can believe that a simple accident can hurt someone that they love. I am sure that they will second guess themselves, and wonder how they could let something like that happen.	sadness	1	6	1	40	125000	6.5	6.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	3.857	1.429	2.4290000000000003	3.143	60	1587	0.23809523809523808	0.09523809523809523	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.19047619047619047	0.19047619047619047	0.0	0.047619047619047616	0.0	3.020242661214572	2.9175389270699057	low	medium	An essay written by a 40 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 125000$.

I am so grateful that the people there set aside a special time to remember all the victims and their families. Such a senseless loss. People just wanting to enjoy some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were forced to wait in pain to hear news of the outcome. I am sure they will never forget that day.  I do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones.	sadness	2	6	6	42	75000	7.0	3.0	3.0	6.5	5.0	3.857	2.714	2.857	4.143	103	1604	0.10526315789473684	0.07017543859649122	0.10526315789473684	0.08771929824561403	0.07017543859649122	0.14035087719298245	0.17543859649122806	0.12280701754385964	0.03508771929824561	0.08771929824561403	0.11538461538461539	3.1592172439355517	2.900598129404273	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

And especially when there were children on board? Such a senseless act. How scared those individuals and the victim must have been when that was happening. It is a good thing that that guy was there to help the passengers get off the bus. A tragic event would have been even more tragic had he not been there to save those people. I feel bad because those individuals (including the guy who saved the passengers) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same. Their lives have been turned upside down because of someone else's senseless act and are forever traumatized by it.

This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work.

I made it all the way through though. I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot. I think that's kinda weird that something like that was even included in an article with feminist tone."	neutral	2	5	1	27	15000	6.0	6.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	3.714	4.571000000000001	4.0	4.143	139	1621	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.4117647058823529	0.11764705882352941	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.03571428571428571	2.482067050265856	2.2223396177554178	low	low	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 15000$.

Many estimates say that there are a lot of people in Russia who survived only on $4.50 a day.  With this little money they do not have the luxury of going out to eat.  Also when living on so little money it is dangerous because of Health Care problems.  If one has to  have surgery or even get expensive medication it can be a real setback to their life style.

They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon.

After reading the whole article, I believe that the other husband has the right to sue the authorities for not saving the his husband after he fell off.

The fact that we cannot live a carefree life anymore because of the sick minds of individuals scares me daily and makes me wish I could keep my kids in a bubble!!!	fear	2	5	1	28	62000	7.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	4.0	2.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	151	1671	0.20833333333333334	0.125	0.020833333333333332	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.041666666666666664	0.22916666666666666	0.125	0.10416666666666667	0.020833333333333332	0.0	2.818349889020395	2.9474151269683913	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000$.

There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.

Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases.

I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too.

As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.

The whole thing is a big mess and can't help the stability of the region.	fear	1	2	1	34	15000	4.0	5.5	1.0	5.0	1.0	3.429	3.143	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	102	1704	0.20833333333333334	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.041666666666666664	0.0	0.2916666666666667	0.125	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	2.7766363863149452	2.645620847010006	medium	low	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 15000$.

It makes me upset to know Native American tribes are being affected by drought to the point of possibly ceasing to exist. I have Native American heritage and feel that this population should be cared for by our government before segments of third world countries. I don't like the fact that air pollution is a problem or a salty lake is drying up in Iran but I understand our environment is controlled by God. We, as a nation, choose our battles sometimes based on the wrong things.

Maybe find an organization to donate time and money too. I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

I think anyone that is forced to go through would need therapy for the rest of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not acceptable! I cannot believe young children are being stripped of their identities, being told who to be, being shamed for who they are, and learning to hate themselves. They know who they are, and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is completely cruel and unjust. This is psychological torture.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

This conflict is rife with airstrikes and drone strikes that drop on civilians and militants alike. Qatar is culpable in the slaughter of citizens, which puts them firmly against the Geneva Conventions. Of course, I do not celebrate the loss of their soldiers' lives, as their families back home are just regular citizens as well in all likelihood.	anger	1	4	1	28	3500	4.0	4.5	1.5	5.5	4.0	4.857	3.143	3.143	4.428999999999999	81	1753	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.28	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.06666666666666667	2.8802231317447196	2.6624138295437967	low	low	An essay written by a 28 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 3500$.

And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	138	1787	0.1590909090909091	0.06818181818181818	0.06818181818181818	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.20454545454545456	0.1590909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.06818181818181818	0.045454545454545456	0.07142857142857142	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430673	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

Someone very close to me deals with tinnitus every day, and I always thought it was odd because I'm the one who has worked in high noise environments, but she's the one who suffers with it. It's interesting because it says psychotherapy is a possible solution which would make us very happy if it's real.	surprise	1	6	1	44	49000	5.5	5.5	1.0	4.5	2.5	4.143	3.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	76	1816	0.0	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.46153846153846156	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	2.642899206214763	2.410467516930119	low	low	An essay written by a 44 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

I didn’t realize how many things are made with cocunut or that they have some kind of bank type of thing to keep the seeds.  I find it so amazing to learn about things I knew nothing about.  I love cocunuts and did buy some cocunut oil but haven’t used it yet.  I heard that the oil was good for your skin and hair, although I haven’t tried it yet.  Reading the article made me think about the show “Naked and Afraid” since the players are often in the jungle, trying to survivor and finding cocunuts on the trees.  Or on the TV show Survivor, where they often eat and drink coconut juice.  In honesty, I don’t know if I have ever eaten a cocunut even though I thought I did.

Every day, it seems to be something new. Here in Detroit, we see it all the time and I know you're in a similar situation in Philadelphia. The article doesn't give any details about the victims or anything like that. It almost dehumanizes people, don't you think? I mean, these victims were somebody's relatives. Hopefully more details will come out in future articles. The news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details. I know I am rambling here.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high.

I was left wondering why France wanted to dismantle the camp and why the refugees were so angry and against the move. What was really going on here? Were there some other issues that had nothing to do with humanitarian considerations?

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

I thought it sounded pretty funny. The article described some of the ways people are protesting, from covering the star with graffiti, to putting a Bernie Sanders sticker on it, to putting a barbed wire fence around it. I don't like that he even has a star, and I think if I were to go to Hollywood, I'd like to do something like this as well.	joy	2	6	1	39	21600	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	90	1850	0.0	0.0	0.29411764705882354	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.23076923076923078	2.4833633257315753	2.34217654611012	low	low	An essay written by a 39 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600$.

After reading this story, it's hard to feel sympathetic, even in retrospect. But the story confuses me, too. Didn't Bayh used to work for Fox News after he quit the Senate? The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career. It's all very confusing, but overall, I'm glad he's staying gone.	joy	2	6	1	59	25500	4.0	6.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	3.571	2.714	4.714	4.143	113	1854	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.34782608695652173	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.21739130434782608	0.14285714285714285	2.161057768392393	1.9991062341156658	low	low	An essay written by a 59 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25500$.

In the beginning I wrote about how our friendship began, and wrote about all of my favorite memories with her from as far back as I could remember. Our first interaction to when we first started texting and getting to know each other, all the way up to when I wrote the letter. She is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how grateful she is to have me as a friend. I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me. I made the end of the letter forward looking and wrote of how grateful I considered myself to be because she was in my life, and how I hoped that wouldn’t change for a long, long time.	joy	1	4	3	28	456566	4.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	2.4290000000000003	3.571	2.571	3.0	150	1856	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.2647058823529412	0.14705882352941177	0.058823529411764705	0.29411764705882354	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.0	0.17647058823529413	0.1111111111111111	2.9720048395187972	2.7761004849593856	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 456566$.
