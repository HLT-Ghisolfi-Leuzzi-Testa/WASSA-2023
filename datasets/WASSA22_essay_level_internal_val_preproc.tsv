I don't understand why the syrian government is trying to harm the people there whey they didn't do anything wrong. I think the whole situation is really sad and that a lot of innocent people are getting hurt for no reason. War is awful and I hope that there's a solution to it soon. I'm glad that the UN is trying to do something, but I just don't think that it's enough.	sadness	2	4	1	29	27000	7.0	6.5	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	1.714	4.857	81	1486.0	0.16129032258064516	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.16129032258064516	0.1935483870967742	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.15384615384615385	2.5418516383804755	2.4711268036054683	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 27000$.The essay expresses high empathy and high distress levels.

This is an area which has hopes of dramatic infrastructure improvement and new jobs.  Many people and organizations have invested a lot of money and now have to wonder whether they should continue to invest in an area which may be destroyed by rioters.  It's so sad to hear about these beautiful farms and nurseries just being gutted and destroyed.  The farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do.  The farms are gone.  It sounded as if some of the elders in the community tried to calm things down, and it worked in some areas, but other areas just raged on with riots and destruction.

It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern. I am really worried about the outcome for these bears.

Anyway, as I said, I don't care about Haiti.	sadness	2	4	1	26	35000	7.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.714	2.571	4.0	3.571	92	1501.0	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.16	0.08	0.24	0.08	0.08	0.04	0.12	0.058823529411764705	2.1613247764024894	2.1338048811798553	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 35000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression. Not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients lead to sicknesses. Theres people who don't have enough time to see a doctor. Our lifestyle is the reason we're not getting enough sleep.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience.

Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.	sadness	2	6	5	33	51000	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	145	1523.0	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.041666666666666664	2.883141101795506	2.6395763754432755	An essay written by a 33 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

Can you imagine what it must be like to flee from something so incredibly dangerous and then lose your life at sea or see people die while you're escaping? I wonder sometimes what must possess refugees to do this. Is there no other way for them to escape? Why do they risk their lives when they know the numbers of people who die in situations like this? It must be awful where they are coming from for them to risk it all. I mean, look at that star soccer player. She was like royalty in her country and a celebrated athlete. If even she took the risk and died, what must it be like for other people?	sadness	2	7	1	31	67000	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	2.0	4.0	3.143	2.714	4.571000000000001	123	1552.0	0.19607843137254902	0.0392156862745098	0.1568627450980392	0.0392156862745098	0.0196078431372549	0.1568627450980392	0.21568627450980393	0.0784313725490196	0.0392156862745098	0.058823529411764705	0.09090909090909091	2.9458833071758908	2.850075085513577	An essay written by a 31 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 67000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists.

That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place. That reminds me of the fire that happened at my neighbors house.	sadness	1	6	1	28	100000	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	149	1556.0	0.24444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.08888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.08888888888888889	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.08333333333333333	3.0210370860408338	2.9018071502690783	An essay written by a 28 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and high distress levels.

It was horrifying reading about the accounts because people could be heard screaming and shouting for help. I'm hopeful that they can help find any remaining survivors. This is such an unfortunate event. The cause was due to bad building construction as the developers have cowardly gone into hiding. Experts said a recent drilling underneath the building triggered the collapse. This is horrible to hear. Could you imagine if this happened to the office building we worked out?

It's bad enough because it is just a natural disaster situation, but the fact that there was also mismanagement involved is particularly troubling.  The government failed to properly care for the canals.  The article also speaks of selling off many of its wild animals.  This might become a very serious problem given the fact that some of the animals are endangered species such as the wild dog.  They are also looking at selling off elephants, lions and pythons.  Even if they do this, how much of the money will ever actually reach its citizens to help them?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	119	1567.0	0.14285714285714285	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.11428571428571428	0.11428571428571428	0.05714285714285714	0.22857142857142856	0.08571428571428572	0.05714285714285714	0.05714285714285714	0.05	2.7621603041759193	2.711065333723213	An essay written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

How could they just blatantly violate people in this way?  I suppose it is hopeful that we might learn from this, correct mistakes, but that doesn't mitigate the harm that was done!  It also doesn't bode well that protecting the victims now, after the fact, also seems to be in question.  The assumption that they were informed of the release of the data, I think, is reckless.  Verification that the already suffering victims won't be further victimized is as important as the far reaching implications of the data itself!

There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.  All this necessary killing is not good for this word.  This is really, really bad that we need war to solve problems.	sadness	1	5	2	39	49000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	5.0	146	1600.0	0.17073170731707318	0.17073170731707318	0.04878048780487805	0.07317073170731707	0.024390243902439025	0.0975609756097561	0.1951219512195122	0.14634146341463414	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.045454545454545456	2.873117046582314	2.7557930866304012	An essay written by a 39 years old hispanic or latino male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 49000$.The essay expresses high empathy and low distress levels.

It is so sad that these young people have to take their life because they think there is no end in sight. What we need to do along with providing therapy for those that are bullied is to increase the consequences for those who are bullying others. This may have happened in Europe but in America teachers know this bullying is going on and they tend to protect the football players and other jocks. It is really sad. I hope you have never been bullied.

I wish the article had been more informative and told a more comprehensive story about what happened and why the children were spared when three adults were killed. Perhaps there was a spat between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a traumatic incident. Either way, no good comes out of this entire situation."	sadness	1	6	5	31	75000	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	106	1615.0	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.07142857142857142	3.152427091874956	3.0336656535815734	An essay written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.The essay expresses low empathy and low distress levels.

Im talking about Iraq, which is dividing into 3 main groups who have competed for limited resources for a long time. And the wealth of oil taken by the leaders and not shared with prosperity for all people has increased tensions. When I was young it was Iraq Iran War, the Saddam Hussein reign of terror, then the First Gulf War, the the Second Iraq War, then ISIS.

The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added.

Their ineffable ineptitude constantly leads to environmental disasters and someone has to put a stop to their BS before we let them completely destroy our habitat here on Earth.	anger	1	6	1	23	44000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	5.0	60	1752.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.630262825461545	2.6802911240046727	An essay written by a 23 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 44000$.The essay expresses low empathy and medium distress levels.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

There are some countries that are for the poaching of elephants if you can believe it. Some more rural communities say that the animals harm their crops.

The fact that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more damage, more permanent damage, seems to back that up. It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity? It's confusing, because I can't think of any reason other than harm someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the case here."	surprise	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	115	1836.0	0.16279069767441862	0.13953488372093023	0.0	0.06976744186046512	0.0	0.11627906976744186	0.23255813953488372	0.16279069767441862	0.09302325581395349	0.023255813953488372	0.0	2.6794974527734756	2.698839484602791	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.The essay expresses high empathy and medium distress levels.

Supporting this kind of big event is always remarkable and will always be remembered by people.	joy	1	6	1	32	10000	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	5.5	3.429	4.0	2.857	3.286	57	1852.0	0.0	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.05555555555555555	0.3333333333333333	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.08333333333333333	2.986752134858756	2.716102602796315	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 10000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2	5	4	26	45000	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	150	1853.0	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.20833333333333334	0.20833333333333334	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	An essay written by a 26 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.
