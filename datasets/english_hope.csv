Ashton Levry I get what you're saying but at the same time why should they defend people that we say all lives matter if we're all created equal shouldn't there be all right for us to say all lives matter because honestly I think we do matter we all matter but even if you're what you're saying is true then it shouldn't hurt your feelings that we say all lives matter no offense	hope
It wasn’t erected as a symbol of slavery... it wasn’t a symbol of racial profiling... it was erected as historical significance for what he did to help build in the city... on the basis of your argument you’d have idiots destroying 90% of all historical buildings and monuments in the uk. Protest peacefully not ok to go around defacing property as a mass mob. Abide by the law or face the consequences....stupid sheeple committing crimes... an eye for an eye is not acceptable... democracy and justice is...	hope
I am abhorred by what happened to George Floyd.  I am white and I am not a racist.  But it is clear that racists have usurped this movement.  They are racists against freedom and against our constitutional liberties.   These racists want to destroy everything that has been gained for blacks and for whites in this country.  They want to bring tyranny and oppression giving control to the Democratic Left who have oppressed so many for so long.  Stand up America!!  And stop them now!	hope
A kind gentle man has to endure torture because he just prefers his own gender. Whatever sexual acts he does at least 90% of heterosexual women do for their partners also. Why is it so terrible. What is wrong with religious people to condemn something that is neither bad or unnatural. The profess to be the religion of love yet are so hateful and intolerant.	hope
You can't change the world with hate you just make hate  and you can't change people without showing a changing in yourself if someone going stay corrupted  the rest of the world ain't going to change for you and some people and going to change you just got to be happy in your life amongst a world full of haters	hope
Now for premise I am not American and I don't get the whole context and details of this issue but according to my research (meaning stats some from the FBI) black lives are disproportionately hurt by police brutality compared to other races	hope
The fact is that racism points fingers in All directions. There are both good and bad people of all cultures and nationalities. To say ALL LIVES MATTER does NOT exclude African Americans. It would be a constructive peaceful way of bringing us ALL as equals. Now ALL LIVES MATTER would promote putting an end to racism once and for all.	hope
This is so inspiring!  MD/ PhD in engineering is my end goal! I have too many ideas and realized I need engineering training to do the research.  My brother is a petroleum engineer. I'm at community college starting my journey to wherever school I end up! My credits in Psychology I have 119 but too old to transfer but working in psychiatric field and mental health has given me the vision I have now	hope
All lives matter ! why is Black live matter ? Why is White live matter ? Why is Yellow live matter ? All lives matter ! But do what you think its right ! Never ever mistaken between Criminals and  Heroes !	hope

Jessica Walker I think most people don’t even know what you are trying to argue about. I agree with you. Most people may or may not like homosexuals but it’s just an opinion it’s really not like they hate them. I personally don’t support homosexuality but I also don’t hate them. I just don’t support them in general. I do have one friend who is bi but I don’t really mind that he’s bi just as long as he  doesn’t act “odd” around me. Also	hope
I know  there is some sexism in the workforce and there is no doubt about that. But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.	hope
Bisexual Unicorn here and I absolutely love this video. These kids were so darling. I feel bad for this poor man though. Why can't people stop pushing their beliefs on others? Religious people want to say that we as LGBTQ+ individuals are doing that to them but we're just being who we truly are. If anything	hope
It’s racist to say black lives matter it’s correct to say all lives matter nBlack people are not the only race that has poverty what about all other races if you are a minority you get free stuff like government assistance free school opportunities if you are Caucasian and poor to bad there’s no help for you maybe we should take a look at that	hope
So I like boys like sexually. Like I would marry a boy. But I kinda like girls romantically. And I'm not against romantic feelings towards the same gender. Now sexually I don't support it but I will be there for anyone who is. I support people not for what they do but for their spirit and compassion towards everyone. Pls don't come at me	hope
stop forcing people to forcefully study engineeringnengineering is made for humans nif a girls want to study engineering she willnif she wants to study something other than engineering she willnIts totally her choice.nnnnnA person should only study something in which he/she is interested in and thus can excel in that field only.	hope
There are lgbtq persons who do bad things. Thats a given. But that shouldnt be the license to hate everybody else in the lgbtq sphere cause a lot of us are nice and righteous. Generalizing is what needs to go. Ps	hope
Yo for real why do all of you guys care so much about what her sexuality is gonna be? Because she has short hair and wears cuff jeans?  A lot of people wear cuff jeans and have short hair that aren't LGBT+. I'm okay if she does become LGBT+	hope
when i was young i always took my brothers legos and cars and built things i hated barbie dolls. I never have felt like the other girls i am really considering engineering. I always threw the dolls and such away i think im finally realizing this field exists. Thanks to women like you.	hope
I have always been an artiest and a writer i never wanted to be an engineer nAnd here i'm an engineer student it's my first year in college and yes i always feel this is not my place i always fail nBut this video made me so hopefull nI see myself in this video 10 years from now	hope
im glad they got a male perspective to balance the discussion... dafuq. you know how much easier it is to get a job as a woman. they want to hire 50% women when theyre 20% of grads. how is that equal for a generation thats been taught woman can do anything as good as men. it should be about ability not genitals. i totally agree on that point.	hope
I lost most all except one of my friends after coming out as bisexual. I’m lucky my family is so accepting. My sister is bisexual as well. The only hard part is my grandparents on my fathers side. We meet up every year for a few days. My older cousins bring their girlfriends and every year at the end of the visit my grandparents say to me “Someday you will bring your boyfriend to be with us. We can’t wait to meet him when you get one”. It’s so awful	hope
Whatever happened to Coronavirus? Remember how governments and the elites told us to stay at home and not gather in large groups because of this Deadly Virus. Now the same Elites are supporting this large groups of people gathering and some don’t even speak out against This. nHypocrisy.	hope
A lot of our children are addicted. Meth floods the streets the dealers give it out for free like candy too get addiction started plus they dust fentanyl on pot sales to get them addicted this is driving crime. We need help all of us!

All lives do matter yes right now most of the hate right now is between multicolor multicultural differences right now its sad to have this hate towards one another im sorry but I believe all lives matter don't matter what color what gender or religion or sexual orientation now we can not ignore this hateful racism acts and violence we are humans we all have blood flowing through our veins.	hope
+Lexus Fox Women in western countries don't choose to go into those fields because of  lack of interest and that is due to cultural reasons.In third world countries (I live in one) engineering is not a predominantly male field.In fact I didn't know it was in the western world until I watched this video and read some stats on it.	hope
When I was young I was given dolls and kitchen/cooking toys but I was more interested in creating my own miniature houses out of cardboard boxes. With it I had the option to put what I want in my houses/structures. It was much more fun to be able to create something.nnI also loved drawing and started it young but then I thought my drawings were different than my classmates' and I was too shy for anything so I had to match my drawings to the theirs because I was too scared to be bullied again... I was bullied sometimes. I was scared to be good at what I do because I would grab attention if did.nIt just made me put away my interests as if these were not a big deal and I grew up thinking I do not deserve to shine and beyter just be in the shadows and live a passive life.nI regret it.	hope
What i don't understand about most of these comments is that people are saying that girls with short hair are automatically lesbians or the clothes they're wearing. Looks don't Define Who You Are. It doesn't mean if a girl has short hair or if they're clothes not girly enough doesn't mean girls are automatically lesbians!! You can't just put a label on someone and call them something that they are not without knowing their real lives and stories!!	hope
I never understood racism. I grew up thinking what’s the problem with with different colored humans they’re literally the same but different colors.nTo this day I still don’t know why people think 1 race of humans is better than another race when they’re exactly species	hope
growing up extremely low income and as a woman of color engineering resources were not handed to me there were no toys this warmed my heart to know that girls my nieces age have toys like this regardless of that I'm honored to say I've been accepted to some incredible universities as a bioengineering major so screw anyone who tells young women especially minoritiy disadvantaged  that we can't do it because we can	hope
I love this. I get a little discouraged every time I go to class.I  am the only girl among 110 students in my class. I am currently in my fourth year studying civil engineering. It has been an interesting and challenging ride for me. Listening to Debbie Sterling talk about her experiences gives me hope for this and the next generation of engineer girls.	hope
im sitting here watching this and when he says 'god gave us a choice my choice is to love' im trying not to cry bc my family doesn know yet i told my mom but not really anybody else in my family	hope
ALL LIVES MATTER NOT JUST BLACK LIVES. EVERYONE IS GODS CHILDREN. NO ONE IS ABOVE ANOTHER. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN CURRENTLY IS EXTREME MAOIST ATTITUDES. DEMOCRATS  ONLY PANDER TO THESE ANTIFA AND B.L.M. EXTREMIST GROUPS. -CCFP coalition of the conservative free people.	hope
I find it funny at the amount of attention the lack of female engineers gets while ignoring that females are outperforming males in every aspect of school BESIDES engineering. Females have such options to their career fields but men have not had the same options opening up for them outside of traditional job roles	hope
It's not like I feel I can not because I'm a woman I just don't want to and there is nothing wrong with that there is nothing I can not do because I'm a woman this is just not the path I want to take	hope
Yeah all lives matter dude that includes black lives ALL means every what is it just like ofcourse every life matters besides black lives so we absolutely need to call it black lives matter to make people realize that or am I right and black lives matter is racist.	hope
Candra Rakhmasari nYES!!! using religion to abuse someone and take away their rites goes against the golden rule. Do onto others as you want done to you. It goes against peace when treating people with hate. It makes me so mad when people use religion to abuse other people	hope
You have to check out the trailer for imperium.  all the easily offended are coming out of their hidey holes.  It's sad.  Just scroll through the comments and you will find cancer.  it's disgusting to see people find a way to hate a movie that is purposefully being as neutral as possible while also making a statement on the world's problems.  Please.  I want to see your opinion.	hope
Hive-Mind. Emotional Contagion. Mass Hysteria. Bandwagon. Victim Mentality. Woe-is-Me. Covid-19 Boredom. Pent-up Frustration/Anger/Aggression. Lost sheep looking for a(ny) cause. Misled n Astray. Baaah! Deflection. Diversion.

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination	hope
+Steven T.Parker Is never wrong to have an inspiration to do something and everything can be for you if you like it and work hard. And about this not being a touchy feely subject it is for her different things mean different things for different people. Maybe you don't care but you haven't face the problems or fears she has.	hope
I'm am fortunate to live where I do. If you contribute and act as a decent person you are treated equally the same. Regardless of race religion etc. Knowones life here is undervalued. Not even the sorry people of all colors.	hope
i am a girl when i told my family about me doing engineering my brother saud to me get over your self girls don't do engineering .. well it kind broke my heart i don't know what to do now	hope
She said it bothers her that people call her smart when she wanted to be pretty. I had the exact opposite complaint at that age - I wanted to be called smart instead of pretty. I am a Roboticist today with an extensive background in both software and hardware. I have friends who's parents encouraged them to go into STEM that hated the idea and felt pressured	hope
In my Engineering and Architecture Department around half the students are women  It has really come a long way as to decades ago where only a handful of women are in class. Our landscape architecture and chemical engineering graduates are all women. Why? I have no idea to be honest	hope
even if shes talkin for women i as a male was really motivated by her. I always wanted to be an engineer but i lack of confidence that maybe im not smart enough(or not born smart enough) but its more like how bad you want it.	hope
Every parengts wiling to put their child into mental and physical abuse in one of those so called therapy camp should be charged for child abuse. This is revolting and I don't understand why in the Obama era they didn't do anything. Now with Trump it's gonna continue and worsen	hope
I am a girl/woman and an electrical engineer. nWhen I was a little girl I always wanted to have the lego stuff of my big brother and i loved to fight with selfe made weapons... but my mother always wanted a cute little girl which will get an artist or sth like this	hope
All lives matter. There I said it. God bless you sir. I don't know you from diddly squat.  I have respect for you. Because you wear the badge and the uniform. You come across all kinds of people good or bad. God bless you and men and women that are   in law enforcement.  Some cops do good no matter what. There is good and bad in all people. Just remember folks we bleed the same color. God bless the USA.. We need his blessings bad.	hope
Her eyes are so beautiful. Very striking. You can tell this is very heartfelt and emotional and genuine. She has become very soft spoken here and it says much to the love she has in her heart for the underdog and those who suffer. Wonderful Madonna.	hope
It’s a fact but it’s not the case at this time. We don’t have oppression at such a large scale by ‘all races’. There are problems in the black community that needs to be fixed at this very moment. Of course all lives matter but saying all lives matter against black lives matter is like math. You have a problem you need to solve so you solve one problem at the time	hope
Blue Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter. Hispanic Lives Matter. Asian Lives Matter. White Lives Matter. ETC.....All Lives Matter! Defend the Police. Reduce crime. Stop resisting arrest. Stop talking back. Obey the Law. Respect the Police and anyone in Authority. Simple Rule. Criminals are like Children. You need to punish bad behaviors. Law and Order and Justice=A Civilized Society.	hope
I dont understand why it is up to anyone else but yourself to make the decision to become an engineer or whatever. The great thing about america or any other nation that is similar is that if you work hard you can accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to. Obviously you need to network and some luck but saying you need to get more diversity just to get more diversity is absurd. I dont care who the engineer that helps make my bridge	hope
Being pro-life and pro-sterilization is not hypocritical. nnBasically you can believe that a mother shouldn't get herself pregnant AND believe that if she does get herself pregnant that she shouldn't be allowed to murder her kid.nnThis is no stranger than pro-life people advocating abstinence. They're not trying to make sure women have babies; they just don't approve of murdering children.	hope
