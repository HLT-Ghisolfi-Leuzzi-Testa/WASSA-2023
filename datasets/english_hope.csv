I live in my mom's basement I was being very calm about what I said sir and for you to be ignorant with your words is immature please if you want to have a debate make sure there’s no assumptions and your only stating Facts because you assumed that I don’t care about white speakers. I’m black and the black community have been oppressed for years and we have been able to have open arms to other cultures including whites and it’s not fair for you to assume what you assumed	hope
That one girl whos like I do not agree with homosexuality. nnnGirl you got a short haircut the bottom of your jeans cuffed a sweater and its bergundy ish. Your not any part of Lgbtq thats a lie. You dont agree with Lgbtq people thats a lie. You probably said that because your family and your church are watching. She will come out in a few months or years.  Btw people hating Lgbtq people and they are religious people God says not to hate anyone so like its the same wrong. Also I have a family who isnt religious but is religious if you know what I mean and I respect anyone no matter what and if thats who they are I let them be who they are evn if I dont agree.	hope
Everyone hating on the girl who disagrees with homosexuality needs to think of this from a younger person’s perspective. She’s still a child. She hasn’t matured and hasn’t been able to experience enough to formulate her own opinions yet. She may have beliefs based on how her parents raised her. Doesn’t mean she’s homophobic	hope
Wow! I'm 13...I want to become an engineer!...People have told me tht I would never fit in cuase I'm a girl...I even had a teacher told me once..tht I should go to fashion school and let the boys do tht hard work...after seeing this in 2018!...I want to become an engineer and inspired girls too just like you do!	hope
The little kid that said that God gave him a choice and he chose to love is the greatest kid i've ever seen. There's so much wrong portrayal of what christianity is on the media that is refreshing to see someone who actually gets the concept. And i also love that Annie regardless of her point of view respected the survivor's opinion and got to an agreement. Ilove them all please protect them	hope
Same here. I never saw it as something I wouldn't be able to do if I wanted to. And I never thought being female should play a part in that. Who cares if there are fewer women in the engineering fields than men?! I'm here because I wanted to work on engineering projects	hope
My sister is a lesbian ... nIts not that easy (for everyone) nMaybe im just stuck up and still think she is to young to decide who she is (she is 18...)nIt was still a hard thing for me to hear	hope
I so scared I cry ever night praying my friend will be ok praying nothing happens just cause she’s not the colour of me don’t mean I not there for her she the only person I loved with my whole heart that’s not my family but she like a sister to me	hope
There are only two sexes (and also intersex people so technically three sexes) but gender identity is up to the person. It’s a very western idea that there are only two genders and many other cultures believe differently and have believed differently for thousands of years. If a person wants to express their gender as something non binary to boy and girl they should have the freedom to do so. If they aren’t hurting anyone else why make them change into something they aren’t comfortable with	hope
The only thing that puts doubt in girls minds are videos like this. to whom ever is making stuff life this. nnGet bent! And i hope to the atheist God that my daughter grows up and understands that all this is just bullshit and that her fate is in her own hands	hope
So emotional watching this I'm not black but I felt that!! why should they have to walk past that filth every day and in this day and age when they are still prosecuted every day for just  having a differnt shade of skin colour !! the most beautiful and diverse of all colours it makes me sick to think they suffer systematic racism every day wee are 1 this isnt black against white this is united wee are united it's right against wrong and wee unite together wee see if for what it really is !! Stay safe protesters	hope
Anurag Pal how is she forcefully making u do engineering? Shes trying to inspire. If u dont want to do it thats your choice but shes trying to encourage the ppl that do want to do it as a career choice. I dont  get how anything she does is forcefull?	hope
Weather your white or black just think for a solitary second suppose you were white and it is all of a sudden that it was illegal to say all live matter and only black lives matter was allowed to matter how would that make your kind feel????nnIf I were all of you I would heavily think about not caring for only one nationality one race and only one skin color and think about each and every ounce of life that is on this planet because every single day everyone is killing one another and if you all don’t stop it’s going to keep on going until there is no more life on this planet nnAll life matters because all life is precious nnLike Hannity said if you all don’t have the courage to speak out and say ALL Lives MATTER then you all are political racist cowereds. nnGod bless you Hannity.	hope
you're so amazing i'm an engineer too and i'm spending the same moments like you now because of our culture in Egypt .. and i just have the same thoughts ... thanks a lot for doing such a great thing	hope
Thank you! So true! The church has done SO many awful things in God's name and been a terrible reflection of Christ. Praying the church can wake up and repent of its past and present sins. I don't blame people for wanting to stay far from Christianity. It just breaks my heart since I know the way many Christians act is so contrary to the way Jesus called us to live. He loved sinners	hope
stop forcing people to forcefully study engineeringnengineering is made for humans nif a girls want to study engineering she willnif she wants to study something other than engineering she willnIts totally her choice.nnnnnA person should only study something in which he/she is interested in and thus can excel in that field only.	hope
I'm am fortunate to live where I do. If you contribute and act as a decent person you are treated equally the same. Regardless of race religion etc. Knowones life here is undervalued. Not even the sorry people of all colors.	hope
Abdallah Shakeel like I said why is it just black lives matter it should be all lives matter so yeah it sounds racist to me mate what about Muslims Chinese or Mexican lives I’m sure we all matter as one race and that’s humans . I don’t see colour or religion I see the person the human life	hope
All you need to do is let girls choose their own subjects. Don't make other girls have to choose what you want them too. Give them their own options. In fact I've never heard anyone tell girls that they can't choose engineering or science. Let them choose what they enjoy.	hope
The fact a lot of people become famous and forget who helped them become famous and Madonna did not! She basically saying the lgbtq helped me become me and in return I’m forever in there “debt.” (In a good way) and I will never forget that and will All ways help out. It’s not just saying okay I support the lgbtq it’s acutely doing something on a daily and not just during pride and Madonna shows that and she helped us as we helped her and that’s amazing!!!	hope
This was such a heartfelt Ted talk & really hit home for me as an industrial engineer in my senior year. Especially personally this week because I have dealt my whole college life with doubters and disbelievers in my intelligence and diligence & to realize I'm not alone in feeling alone was very awakening and motivating. I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded. An engineer once asked me what it was like to be in a mans world and I replied with I'm used to it and it's not a mans world	hope
Let’s talk about the fact that we are in the middle of a serious pandemic and people are dying left and right.  That’s where our focus should be right now!  Not about who’s life matters and whose doesn’t!  Stop the madness please!!!!	hope
Now stop this protesting because we are all equal. My best friend is black and even she says all of this is blown out of proportion. Yesterday in the U.K. I seen 2 black police officers dragging a white man across the pavement. You don’t see me recording it shouting at them saying there racist. There doing there job	hope
This is the best speech I’ve ever heard! So inspirational! I’m 14 and I want to be an  engineer. I dropped Drama for product design a few months ago and it was the best decision I ever made! It’s now my favourite subject! But I’m in a class of about 20-25 and there’s only 2 girls (that’s including me)	hope
“I don’t agree with homosexuality” boy someone ought to teach you some manners! Nah but seriously people need to realize that this is not a choice. I have a classmate who is bisexual (it’s a girl) and she absolutely loves girls but she can’t be in an open relationship because her parents would despise her if they ever found out. Being against someone who is LGBT is basically being against people’s existence and everyone has the right to live their lives as they see fit. Of course just because you are a certain way right at this moment doesn’t mean you are destined to be that way forever	hope
Yeah all lives matter dude that includes black lives ALL means every what is it just like ofcourse every life matters besides black lives so we absolutely need to call it black lives matter to make people realize that or am I right and black lives matter is racist.	hope

Whatever happened to Coronavirus? Remember how governments and the elites told us to stay at home and not gather in large groups because of this Deadly Virus. Now the same Elites are supporting this large groups of people gathering and some don’t even speak out against This. nHypocrisy.	hope
This is great! As a middle school science teacher I know and see how our culture does not seem to support females in science. I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up. Teaching young girls to persevere and work hard is not a bad thing.	hope
As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying “I’m religious” but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or “mean” with. Was not the drunkerds	hope
God bless women. It would've been so boring to live without them. I LOVE YOU GIRLS LOL. I like it so much when i see a girl fighting for her dreams and succeed despite the fact there are so many obstacles  in her way.	hope
That's probably because they're still in the closet due to their christian brainwashing from their church. It happens a lot in Christian communities. Usually when they start to live outside that community then theh might just might come out. I grew up in a Christian community so I say this from seeing my LGBTQ friends come out not until their early 20s or even later. I love them all which is one of the many reasons why I am not Christian anymore. The churches thinking they have the right to judge. Check yourselves Christians read Romans 1	hope
I personally don't agree with alot of what is being said about black lives matter.it should be all lives matter.  A lot of people are starting riots and uprising against each other.  That makes these people look just as bad as some police who are wrong and. Do wrong if everyone prays and forgives we as a nation might still have a chance.	hope
My grandma was in the military. My aunt is a doctor. My mom is a University professor. My older sister is an architect. I want to be a video game developer. I'm so proud to be in a family of intellectual and accomplished black women.	hope
I cried while watching this video. Clearly pain is being reflected in every word when the guy was talking about abuse. There are so many evil people in this world. I hope no one ever goes through such pain at early age in their life.nThank you HiHo for creating this video. I'm learning a lot. I also showed this video to my little sisters and now they have also subscribed to your channel.	hope
I'm a guy and I played Barbie doll when I was a kid. But I chose electrical engineering to be my major while I was in college. And now I'm a engineer. Hahaha. I still think Barbie dolls are pretty. What's wrong with guys playing Barbie?	hope
Well I mean if they're truly your friend then you aren't. Racism is rooted in a deep prejudice and hate towards someone of a different race. If you have a hate for someone can you be friends with them? I didn't think so. I have MANY black friends. This makes me.. not racist!! Because if I was truly racist I wouldn't associate with them and keep to my fellow whites. You guys need a dictionary sometimes.	hope
What i don't understand about most of these comments is that people are saying that girls with short hair are automatically lesbians or the clothes they're wearing. Looks don't Define Who You Are. It doesn't mean if a girl has short hair or if they're clothes not girly enough doesn't mean girls are automatically lesbians!! You can't just put a label on someone and call them something that they are not without knowing their real lives and stories!!	hope
When my mom suggested to me to become a civil engineer I pictured myself this strong smart woman in suits designing beautiful constructions visiting the site and giving instructions to the workers. It sounded pretty amazing as a girl who will be doing such things. And right now I'm on the path to become an engineer but sometimes I really do feel lonely and discouraged though. These kind of talks really inspire and sharpen me a lot! Thank you so much. And what you are doing right now is so great Debbie!	hope
I have always been an artiest and a writer i never wanted to be an engineer nAnd here i'm an engineer student it's my first year in college and yes i always feel this is not my place i always fail nBut this video made me so hopefull nI see myself in this video 10 years from now	hope
I am abhorred by what happened to George Floyd.  I am white and I am not a racist.  But it is clear that racists have usurped this movement.  They are racists against freedom and against our constitutional liberties.   These racists want to destroy everything that has been gained for blacks and for whites in this country.  They want to bring tyranny and oppression giving control to the Democratic Left who have oppressed so many for so long.  Stand up America!!  And stop them now!	hope
Beating someone with a Bible? Have they ever actually read the book? To say nothing of the fact that beating someone to get them to do something is liable to make them more determined not to. Of course it doesn't work - anyone who expects otherwise is kidding himself.	hope

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I’ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. “Men shall not lay with man” was originally meant to read as “man shall not lay with boy”. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God’s words are harming real people on a daily basis.	hope
Amazing talk! What a terrible professor to be so discouraging and daring to make fun of students-this really triggered me and reminded me of one of my former chemistry professors-so rude that everyone stayed quiet out of fear of her retaliating and giving bad grades.These people should NOT be teaching! I'm so glad Debbie didn't give up	hope
i am a girl when i told my family about me doing engineering my brother saud to me get over your self girls don't do engineering .. well it kind broke my heart i don't know what to do now	hope
Anurag Pal how is she forcefully making u do engineering? Shes trying to inspire. If u dont want to do it thats your choice but shes trying to encourage the ppl that do want to do it as a career choice. I dont  get how anything she does is forcefull?	hope
Where is the law here? Anyone can do anything? Where is democracy? BTW I don't like the statue and I think it was bad to have it in the first place. But my question is still valid. This is not the way. This is anarchy.	hope
I’m lesbian and I’m so glad that I didn’t have to go through this. I’m sorry you had to go through this. I mean technically I’m only out to my friends and my Mam and brother I’m kinda scared to come out to the rest of my family	hope
Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering	hope
I played this in my high school engineering (PLTW) class today. I told a young lady that her story would never be as inspirational as yours--- I told her to make no mistake; have no misunderstanding--- YOU BELONG HERE. I hope she never has to hear what you heard in higher education.	hope
It really sucks at least in america you have freedom of speech for now. I can't believe in 2020 we are still having skin colour prejudice and issues as a result it is pathetic if in millennia we can't get past something so simple as to understand that diversity is a benefit to our survival as a species we are doomed.	hope

I'm 14 and in our school we have a STEM program the fact that I'm a girl never discouraged me from applying. But I know that it discourages other girls as there are 22 kids in the program and only 6 of us are girls.	hope
