48	210	Reading about the attack on Paris that happened years ago brought up a lot of bad feelings and thoughts. I had completely forgotton about it because of how often things like that happen. It makes me upset to think that we are becoming numb to terror attacks in a way. i can only hope that the people affected have found peace and eventually we all will find peace	1.0	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	47	Hope/Sadness

I'm happy to see so many people speaking out and making issues with PTSD more easy to talk about. We can't keep ignoring these issues and pretending that we just can't do anything for our vets.

182	305	I find this kind of thing more pathetic and infuriating than really sad. The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful. Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient. of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides. But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online. I'm not a strong person. At all. But that thought remains completely foreign to me.	1.1666666666666667	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	681	Anger

467	326	This article is ridiculous. I'm part Jewish and all of this is absurd. Likening our country to Nazi Germany in any way is just embarrassing. The idea that our democracy is under threat because we had a democratic election is too stupid for words. I like Jews and am part Jewish, as I said, but I have no sympathy for this kind of nonsense. Trump has supported Israel far more than any other President in recent memory. Obama abandoned Israel and sided with Iran. Is that what Jews want in a President? They feel safe with that? They feel threatened by a President who supports them and vows to defend them? People are stupid, even Jews, some of the smartest people in the world.	1.0	2.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	466	Anger
207	201	This whole issue is bullshit. Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates. The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it. The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do. This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process. And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement. It's disgraceful.	1.0	3.875	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	206	Anger

470	326	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective. Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation. Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy. Is that the type of President Jews want? Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much. I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean. That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point. We're not the problem.

But I guess it doesn't really matter now. It also seems lonely that the rescue people couldn't even get to their bodies.

I was amazed that China would allow women to hold that kind of position - shockingly modern of them. And that she was widely respected warms my heart.	3.333333333333333	1.0	27	2	7	1	46	41000	4.5	7.0	3.0	6.0	1.0	4.286	2.857	4.857	5.0	1	train	61	Neutral
