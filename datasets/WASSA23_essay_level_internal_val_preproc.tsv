This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

369	80	I don't really care about this issue, in part because I don't even understand it.  All these ethnic and religious conflicts with displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups--they just tire me after a while.  I do tend to agree with the idea that these are internal matters, not international matters.  Burma has a right to independence and to protect itself against deemed threats.  The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.

105	67	Just got finished reading an article about the number of refugees who are perishing while trying to traverse the Mediterranean sea on their way from war torn countries. Apparently, the E.U. is still more focused on preventing these people from reaching their shores than they are trying to protect them. Personally, I think that the U.S. and Russia should be taking more than their fair share of these displaced people.	5.833333333333333	5.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	2414	Disgust	0.1891891891891892	0.08108108108108109	0.16216216216216217	0.02702702702702703	0.05405405405405406	0.08108108108108109	0.0	2.889257168148965	2.726688923696076	"Just got finished reading an article about the number of refugees who are perishing while trying to traverse the Mediterranean sea on their way from war torn countries.

It was a gruesome article how he forced these women to have sex with him or drugged and raped them despite the women pleading no.   Stories like this really affect everyone.  It's quite horrendous to think this happens so much in our culture.
