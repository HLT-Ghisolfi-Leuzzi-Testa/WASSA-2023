It is sad that they know how deadly and unsafe these worker conditions are but still have yet to close them. I am happy they are set to close around 1,000 but i think more has to be done. There should be a council and regulations set up like osha in the us to protect workers and make sure all precautions are being done to preserve human life. Now families are left without there sons fathers and incomes when they could have easily just shut this down.

It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct.

308	48	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	3.5	5.5	38	2	6	1	35	148000	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	1	train	307	Hope/Sadness	1.3986013986013988	1.3986013986013988	4.195804195804196	4.195804195804196	4.195804195804196	3.4965034965034967	0.6993006993006994

470	326	I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective.  Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation.  Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats.  Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats?  For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN?

207	201	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

And yet there presence there is contributing to that exact thing.  Maybe they're hunting them.  I don't know.  I find that hard to believe but maybe.  I just think people are stupid.  They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause.  People get what they deserve, largely, though.  So if we make the polar bears extinct, we'll certainly deserve that.  And in some sense so will the polar bears who couldn't adapt to their environment.

These people come from countries that are hellholes they must flee, and they are complicit in that.  How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me.  They have no right to that.  This refugee issue is going to get more problematic and I think it behooves non crappy countries to decide, well in advance, what they're going to do about mass refugee groups, how many they'll take, etc.  you can't wait until they're ther	1.3333333333333333	2.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	295	Anger	0.6993006993006994	0.6993006993006994	2.797202797202797	0.6993006993006994	3.4965034965034967	2.797202797202797	1.3986013986013988

I think it's ridiculous that the premiere of B.C., of the awful NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they did the best they could in difficult conditions.  But what do you expect when a ship carrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel crashes in a relatively remote part of B.C.?  I'm sure the Indians will raise holy hell, since they think they own more than 100% of the province.  But what can be done about any of this now other than clean it up and try not to have it happen again.

I think some women are making allegations and accusations just to get attention or for political motivations.  Who knows why.  People do crazy things for crazy reasons.

They are left without a family member and they have to live with that forever.	1.3333333333333333	1.25	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	445	Sadness	5.88235294117647	2.941176470588235	5.88235294117647	0.0	5.88235294117647	0.0	0.0

It is so sad to me that a war torn third world country has people living there that are afraid for there lives daily. The humanitarian effort is so noble but so sad they are at the hands of a corrupt governemnt and society. How could a government fail to protect its people and aid workers and let them be brutally attacked and raped at there own hands. Noone should be in a position where the power in the society is evil and able to do what they please with no consequence that is a very scary balance.

This river was a main source of life for everyone and it has been ruined forever. I feel for the guy who said it feels like he lost a family memeber a life lost because its been a source of life for so many for so long. It is very unfair that the clean up is so slow going and that they are taking so long to fix there wrong. I also feel bad for the fish who died because mud was stuc in there gills its such a slow painful death.

It seems so avoidable and people are way too young to be making decisions to end their life while they're still a child, I mean what on earth is that about?  I Think there has been a lot of things related to bullying that have contributed to this and also just a breakdown of the family in general.  Maybe kids don't feel like they have enough support system anymore.

I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.	3.8333333333333335	1.125	13	2	6	1	25	60000	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	2	train	817	Sadness	6.862745098039215	3.92156862745098	8.823529411764707	1.96078431372549	9.803921568627452	1.96078431372549	0.9803921568627452

It seems like it is best when we just leave the environment alone and stop tampering with things and intervening.

It's obvious that women there are treated like second rate citizens and do not have many liberties, so anything that can be done to fix this is a positive thing I believe.  This is 2019 and there's no reason why a woman should need a male escort to do anything.  That sounds ridiculous to me as an American woman.  I feel sad for the women living in these nations.

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common.  I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this.  And again, I don't understand it.  Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood.  Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.  And believe me, I understand ""sport.""  But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.  Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible.

There is little dignity in that kind of life since everyone else flees and leaves them alone.	5.833333333333333	6.0	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	305	Sadness	1.4705882352941175	1.4705882352941175	2.941176470588235	4.411764705882352	2.941176470588235	0.0	0.0

It is a condition that they will live with for the rest of their lives but they can recieve help if they reach out for it. I have been through some things in my past that I think are similar to what soldiers go through daily. Could you imagine being sad and feeling like the whole world is against you? I went to prison for a crime I did not even commit. It was horrible for me because it wasnt like I could tell anybody I was innocent, they was all innocent if you let them tell it. I can only begin to imagine what our veterans are going thrugh.

And the families are just as much victims as the people who lost their lives.  The whole thing is terrible, and all of this for nothing.

Yes they are evil and need to be punished but thinking of what lead them to try and kill innocent people they must have had something horrible in there life happen or been in a very toxic enviroment. There should be more talks of mental health and treatment for people instead of banning guns. There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns. This was also odd because he was older 70 years old,and hispanic I wonder if the tension and state of the US made him angered and want to carry out this act.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	980	Sadness	7.8125	4.6875	7.8125	3.125	3.90625	1.5625	0.78125

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up.

She's all alone now. :(	3.8333333333333335	4.625	13	2	6	1	25	60000	6.0	5.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	4.143	1.714	3.857	3.429	1	train	336	Sadness	5.797101449275363	4.347826086956522	5.797101449275363	0.0	5.797101449275363	2.8985507246376816	0.0

25	281	Sally Brampton dies at age 60 from suicide.   Another life lost due to the convoluted medical care mess.   It makes me extremely sad.   I, too, have suffered from dark depression for the last 10 years.  I think daily it would be awesome to die.  Medications do not work for me.   I was born this way and people who know nothing about the intricacies of this terrible disease do not understand.  It's our wiring and absolutely nothing helps when you have had it your entire life.

Of course I would leave with my wife and children because they are the most important things in my life, but it would be hard to know my house is about to get bombed. Also, paying 40 dollars for a kilogram of meat, I could not afford this and I do not live in a war tore country.

181	305	It's issues like this that both upset and confuse me. I just can't understand how children and people in general can be pushed to suicide by what they read or are exposed to on the internet. Perhaps it's because I can't imagine harming myself that I don't understand the state that this people must be in. Suicide is such a tough situation and so hard to deal with. It makes me sad to think people target troubled souls and enjoy seeing the harm they do to themselves.	5.333333333333333	6.5	44	2	6	1	46	22000	6.5	5.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	3.286	2.286	4.857	4.714	2	train	680	Sadness	8.045977011494253	4.597701149425287	8.045977011494253	5.747126436781609	8.045977011494253	1.1494252873563218	2.2988505747126435

These fish cant move debris themsleves and i thin more light needs to shine down on what is happening so maybe a council can come together and monitor or take over and make sure the fish are in a thriving enviroment.

Although this incident is pretty old news, it told of the unrest in Charlotte after a black man was killed by the police. In the protests, someone (not a cop) fired into the crowd, wounding a civilian and four police officers. It's just a sad commentary on where we're at with race relations in this country.

Their marriage was apparently going through a rough spot after having a child with a congenital heart defect and the husband just couldn't bear the thought of living without his wife. They seemed relatively happy on the exterior.

225	417	After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.	1.1666666666666667	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	224	Neutral	8.695652173913045	3.4782608695652177	9.56521739130435	0.8695652173913044	7.82608695652174	2.608695652173913	0.0

The details were sparse, but apparently a man opened fire with an assault rifle in the public space and only killed one elderly man. Say what you will, but this seems like close to an ideal resolution to a scenario like this. The article then doubled back and said the suspect was still alive despite pronouncing him dead earlier in the text.

37	58	I find the article comical.  In these places, people are starving to death and the concern of some people is whether zoo animals are getting enough to eat.  The zoo animals should be slaughtered to feed people.  The horses slaughtered to feed to animals should be fed to people.  The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.

The story upset me because I don't want any animal to suffer.	5.0	1.75	7	1	2	5	29	44000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	2	train	728	Neutral	5.555555555555555	7.4074074074074066	7.4074074074074066	7.4074074074074066	9.25925925925926	0.0	0.0
470	326	Another article about politics slamming one side or the other.   The article refers to America has to heal.   The only way it can heal is people have to quit thinking about me, me, me, and look out for the nation and others.   It seems it just comes down to what vitriol will be posted to some social media site.  People are numb to all of it yet all the national media continues to support one side or the other and not see it as what it is.  	1.0	2.5	8	2	6	1	62	29000	6.5	2.5	1.0	6.5	2.0	3.571	4.0	2.143	4.429	2	train	969	Neutral	3.4482758620689657	2.2988505747126435	2.2988505747126435	3.4482758620689657	2.2988505747126435	1.1494252873563218	0.0
160	302	I just read an article about how air pollution can shorten life expectancy for those diagnosed with lung cancer. I think that this fact is pretty much a given and shortens life expectancy for just about everyone involved in breathing toxic air.

64	150	I just read an article about China's Yu Xu. She was one of the first female fighter pilots cleared for a solo flight. The state run media is very tight lipped about the cause of the accident and the comments attributed to Yu seem very sterile and highly suspect. She was even compared to Mulan at the end of the article. I just don't know about communist governments. The whole thing seemed like lip service to mask a technical failure.	4.333333333333333	2.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	63	Neutral	0.0	1.25	5.0	1.25	3.75	1.25	0.0
139	99	This story did not move me. The story is a little bit sad because of the marriage being broken up and that it not a good thing. It is a good thing that the two children are over 18 and do not have to grow up without both parents being together. The thing about being a hot dad has nothing to do with the story. It is more about the marriage breaking up.	1.5	1.0	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	1	train	138	Neutral	2.73972602739726	0.0	1.36986301369863	8.219178082191782	2.73972602739726	4.109589041095891	2.73972602739726
47	210	I still remember that day when the shooting in Paris happened.  I'm happy that the band went back and spoke with the people in the town hall meeting. I was a little sad by the comments made by the one band member stating that he believed that Muslim security helped the shooters.That kind of thinking is hurtful. The people who did the shooting are monsters, but that does not include all Muslims. 	6.166666666666667	2.625	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	546	Neutral	4.166666666666667	1.3888888888888888	6.944444444444445	4.166666666666667	4.166666666666667	0.0	1.3888888888888888
248	177	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	2.333333333333333	1.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	247	Neutral	8.19672131147541	6.557377049180328	5.737704918032787	5.737704918032787	9.01639344262295	3.278688524590164	1.639344262295082
227	139	Have you heard of the current situation with the amphibian population of the UK. They are being affected by a type of virus right now that is causing much of their population to be wiped out. It is terrible and is likely being caused by human intervention. At least to the point that people are causing the virus to spread faster by them constantly moving the animals and man made ponds being built. I hope the scientific community steps in to correct the issue or many more animals will be harmed.	1.1666666666666667	2.125	23	1	4	2	23	70000	4.0	5.5	6.5	3.5	5.0	2.286	2.0	3.0	4.429	1	train	226	Neutral	4.395604395604395	2.197802197802197	3.2967032967032965	6.593406593406593	5.494505494505495	1.0989010989010988	1.0989010989010988

I can understand that protests can become unsafe or even violent so you need tactics to over come that but with such numbers of people getting very hurt and permanently disabled I think thye should change there tactics.

420	301	This article was so disturbing to read through. I feel like theres so many different levels to these happenings and something has to be done on each to prevent little children from getting these pills in there hands. On the level of the manufactorers we need to have way better packaging like codes the kids cant get into. Doctors prescribing these should ask if they have kids and tell them preventetive measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. Parents need to have a better understanding how easy it is for kids to get into these and die. So senseless dying of something so easy to prevent.	5.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	919	Neutral	4.545454545454545	3.636363636363636	7.272727272727272	3.636363636363636	4.545454545454545	3.636363636363636	0.9090909090909092

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	849	Neutral	3.8167938931297702	3.8167938931297702	3.8167938931297702	5.343511450381679	3.0534351145038165	1.5267175572519085	0.7633587786259541

However, we as mTurk workers are afforded the luxury, and in fact the article more relates to the fact that remote workers are sometimes shut off from communication to the outside world by regular means. This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply. When I contact my superiors that also work remotely, most projects are mishandled in ways and my personalized communication style.	3.8333333333333335	3.375	15	1	5	1	30	10000	4.0	4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.143	3.429	3.286	1	train	212	Neutral	2.255639097744361	2.255639097744361	3.7593984962406015	4.511278195488722	4.511278195488722	1.5037593984962403	1.5037593984962403

It seems like it was a tough call because we are there allies and the us soldiers should have followed protocol by stopping.If it was a miscommunication I hope they take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again as fighting and killing eachother is a waste that needs to be for the bad guys. I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier. I wonder if it was a miscommunication or somehow the soldiers flipped into that bad guys.

Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.	1.8333333333333333	1.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	2	train	873	Neutral	5.797101449275363	5.072463768115942	13.768115942028986	3.6231884057971016	10.144927536231885	2.8985507246376816	2.8985507246376816

It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.

458	371	I feel like there is more to this story.  Apparently the officer was trying to protect himself because she was punching and kicking him to try to resist arrest.  That doesn't make it okay for him to punch her in the face, though, he should have been more professional.  But he is human and it might have been his first instinct, who knows.  I saw that she is suing the city for a million dollars, I bet she is trying to bank on this whole incident.  I don't know how I feel about this really.

I did find it sad that these frogs and other wildlife are dying and possibly suffering from this disease that people are causing by being careless.  However, like they said creating the garden ponds in general is a positive thing that people shoudl do that generally supports wildlife.  So maybe if people would just be a little more careful and take the precautions they were giving then this kind of thing would not happen so much.	1.3333333333333333	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	726	Neutral	3.3707865168539324	4.49438202247191	3.3707865168539324	7.865168539325842	4.49438202247191	0.0	0.0

I just thought the science of it all was interesting, or the analysis . But it shows what humans do to all environments they come in contact with.  They change them.  The migrate and bring in new things.  And that affects stuff.  That's not always our fault, but that's the way of things.  And yet we think it's fine to let refugees and immigrants go where they want, as if there aren't repercussions for that. There are repercussions for everything.  Migration changes habitats.  Change isn't inherently bad, but it's inherently different, and people don't like that.	1.0	1.125	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	225	Neutral	1.7094017094017095	2.5641025641025643	5.128205128205129	3.418803418803419	5.128205128205129	1.7094017094017095	0.8547008547008548

We look at ourselves and our place in the universe as being important, and as if our time defines the universe the way it's supposed to exist.  Polar bears haven't existed for like 99.9999% of the history of the universe, and now we think it's some travesty that they won't exist in the future.  This is incredibly arrogant and self-centered thinking that I think is silly.  I guess I'd rather have a world with polar bears.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	5.0	5.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	975	Neutral	3.0769230769230766	6.153846153846153	2.3076923076923075	5.384615384615384	4.615384615384615	0.7692307692307692	0.0

But I also feel angry and disgusted about the situation.  Venezuela is extremely wealthy due to their oil reserves.  Their country should be vibrant and prosperous.  But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.  But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.	3.1666666666666665	4.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	276	Anger/Disgust	7.462686567164178	5.970149253731343	8.955223880597014	2.238805970149253	8.955223880597014	1.4925373134328357	2.238805970149253

Economy at all costs, especially when you have two trillion people living in these geographically small countries.  And you wonder why environmentalism is a losing battle.  The U.S. and other civilized countries can do all they want.  If a place like Indonesia is willing to burn down all their forests to manufacture palm oil, you're fighting a losing battle.  Again, I keep getting back to this idea: Why are we considered the barbarians in the world?  Most of the world are one step above apes.  They're heathens.  What Reagan said to Nixon was correct.

They can say that it's a function of U.S. interference, but it's not.  It's existed for eons and they've allowed it to grow, and now they either have to fight back or suffer under it.

We hurrah and protract these horrible situations in the middle east and when people are finally forced to pick up and leave we say, ""Sorry, we can't help you."""	4.833333333333333	5.5	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	2	train	761	Anger/Disgust	4.166666666666667	4.166666666666667	2.7777777777777777	9.722222222222223	2.7777777777777777	2.7777777777777777	2.7777777777777777

I'm shocked and thoroughly disgusted that someone would even be able to go through the actions to harm a kitten like this.

These men should never be allowed out of prison for this brutal murder. They just tossed his body in a shallow grave and went on with there lives watching a payperview game.

And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.

It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

271	146	I just read an article about the islamaphobia resulting from the election of Donald Trump. The man has lowered the bar so far and affected our country so negatively for years to come due to his voracious appetite for appointing judges.

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status. I am really pleased with this information.	4.0	4.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	50	Joy/Neutral	3.636363636363636	0.0	7.272727272727272	4.545454545454545	0.9090909090909092	5.454545454545454	0.0

However, those people should have known the hell they were entering when they volunteered.  The rest of it is just Africa and the UN.  I find it hilariously stupid that the rest of the world was shocked and dismayed and whatever word was used to describe their reaction to Kenya threatening to close the refugee camp.  But what does the world do about it?  The world loves to feel holier-than-thou and then do nothing.  Good old UN.  Has an opinion about everything everyone is doing wrong, but no will or capacity to improve anything.

This is so unfair to this gentle giant. Treated to badly just to perform and make money. she is livign a horrible confined life of solitude. It is greatly disturbing that the givernment has the power to stop this yet has turned a blind eye. They need to take action and be an advocate for this poor animal.

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.	1.0	2.625	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	176	Disgust	2.941176470588235	2.205882352941176	2.941176470588235	2.941176470588235	3.676470588235294	1.4705882352941175	1.4705882352941175

It is mainly due to climate change and i believe that is caused mostly by human activities. Because of human greed and consumption, we have to make other living things suffer. Because of this, many animals are facing extinction today.	1.0	1.625	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	54	Disgust	6.0606060606060606	4.545454545454545	6.0606060606060606	4.545454545454545	4.545454545454545	1.5151515151515151	1.5151515151515151

I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.  Like it was preordained or something."	4.0	3.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	89	Neutral/Surprise	3.2258064516129035	4.838709677419355	5.645161290322581	4.032258064516129	4.838709677419355	4.838709677419355	0.0

Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere.  And this event probably really did happen.  But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter.

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.	5.0	3.125	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	346	Hope/Neutral	2.34375	2.34375	1.5625	5.46875	3.125	0.78125	0.78125

IT's really sad to me when people are this negligent about pets and other people.  Especially vulnerable populations.  Honestly I think whatever punishment she gets, such as an animal cruelty charge, is definitely deserved and she will just have to take that as it comes.  She should have been more careful with the animal, end of story.  	2.5	1.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	310	Anger/Sadness	4.49438202247191	3.3707865168539324	4.49438202247191	3.3707865168539324	7.865168539325842	1.1235955056179776	1.1235955056179776
499	103	Everything about Russia really freaks me out. I think this country really needs to be cut off until they can be a more peaceful society. It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world. He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	998	Fear	6.363636363636363	5.454545454545454	9.09090909090909	3.636363636363636	3.636363636363636	2.727272727272727	3.636363636363636

I am suprised that there is a level expectancy but no prosecution for exceeding it and not regular testing of water.

But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.

The fact that thye can do this to a minor, let alone their own daughter, is so bad.	1.0	2.0	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	2	train	877	Anger/Hope	7.4074074074074066	4.938271604938271	8.641975308641975	4.938271604938271	8.641975308641975	4.938271604938271	1.2345679012345678
