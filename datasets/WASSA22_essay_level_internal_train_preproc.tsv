We usually think of human trafficking involving the kidnapping or sudden disappearance of a person. I just read about two pre-teen girls in Burma who were sent to work to help their family. Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay. My heart broke for them and for their parents. What’s even worse, the police ignored the parents’ request for intervention with no success.

She felt like her staff of 250 people thought she knew the show was going to be canceled in 2002 but she did not know anything about it. She was a strong personality and I think if she wanted to change the direction of the show she could have.

That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place.

There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.

In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

At least nobody was injured. On the one hand, it's crazy that people would do this, but on the other hand, I'm not exactly surprised. Trump has been inciting racial hatred and tearing down standards of decent behaviour since before the beginning of his campaign. Let's hope he loses in November and we can file this away as a disgraceful moment in American history, nothing more.""An essay written by a 28 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.The essay expresses medium empathy and medium distress levels.

It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened.

The effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us. The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits.
