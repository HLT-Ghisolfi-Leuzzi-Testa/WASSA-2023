I am sad about the loss of lives. I am in disbelief. How could this happen? The article said they do not believe it was a terrosit attack so that makes me feel relieved, but still worried. US is there to assist Jordan for training. Why our are people being attacked?! The article said they failed to stop at the entrance so I do not know if maybe it was a miscommunication. I am confused to what actually happened. From what I read there was an attack on Jordan when they just drove and barralled through their border so they are on high alert. My heart goes out to all of those involved and I am sad. But why on earth would they think that the US military personal are planning	sadness	2	4	1	35	90000	5.0	3.5	3.5	6.0	3.0	4.857	3.857	4.2860000000000005	5.0	153	0	0.2	0.16	0.08	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.2	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8343964682084324	2.709467724160332	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 90000$.

Trump has been inciting racial hatred and tearing down standards of decent behaviour since before the beginning of his campaign.

The drilling is likely what caused it, and the developer should be held responsible. He has caused much pain and suffering. Kenyans deserve better, and since he didn't listen to NCA warnings, he should pay for what he did. The other buildings in the area should be thoroughly tested to see if anything can be done to prevent this.	sadness	1	6	1	31	65000	3.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	3.5	3.143	3.143	2.857	3.0	74	3	0.19230769230769232	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	2.7877548959069727	2.7379164814574057	low	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000$.

I'm distressed about this news because they're still searching for survivors. There's been a report that 9 are still missing. I hope they're able to find these unfortunate victims. It was horrifying reading about the accounts because people could be heard screaming and shouting for help. I'm hopeful that they can help find any remaining survivors. This is such an unfortunate event. The cause was due to bad building construction as the developers have cowardly gone into hiding. Experts said a recent drilling underneath the building triggered the collapse. This is horrible to hear. Could you imagine if this happened to the office building we worked out? Such awful and careless planning resulting in lost lives.	sadness	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	131	4	0.171875	0.0625	0.046875	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.21875	0.140625	0.109375	0.03125	0.05405405405405406	2.654382900017872	2.6207985860112357	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

I feel sorry for the employees, but its hard to feel sorry for the company since they just dont seem to get it.

Of course, murder was wrong, but what that girl's father did to her was by far more unacceptable in my opinion.	sadness	2	6	1	47	86000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.286	2.571	4.143	59	16	0.08823529411764706	0.11764705882352941	0.08823529411764706	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.08823529411764706	0.17647058823529413	0.14705882352941177	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.07692307692307693	2.814401945455208	2.9719305683624158	medium	medium	An essay written by a 47 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 86000$.

Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	148	17	0.1875	0.0625	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.923798409615175	2.9111292030846174	low	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

It looks as though there were 13 civilians killed during this latest skirmish. It's pathetic to see so many innocent people being killed for no reason over this disputed land. Already there have been two wars fought between these two countries. I hope they can reach a peaceful settlemnt but since this has been ongoing for over 70 years I highly doubt that this will actually happen.	sadness	1	6	1	44	14500	6.5	7.0	6.5	2.5	4.5	3.429	1.429	3.714	3.143	81	19	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.14814814814814814	0.14814814814814814	0.07407407407407407	0.18518518518518517	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037035	0.07407407407407407	0.16666666666666666	2.8369343032539476	2.827755035577317	medium	medium	An essay written by a 44 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 14500$.

I had heard about the lack of water supply in California but I hadn't heard anything at all about the suffering in Nevada also.  It seems that lots of Nevadians, especially the Native Americans who own land there are in trouble from the lack of water.  With everything dying, it is difficult for them to keep animals alive.  Is it also causing problems in families. Who would think that lack of water would be the cause of violence, abuse, and neglect.

Think about people from one country equaling those people dying in gang violence in major, crime ridden societies - but JUST for people attempting to escape via water. What should we do about this? Open our borders? Is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer? Obviously this isnt exacly their fault, especially the kids. But what can we do? Will money help? Probably not. Open borders will. Bring them here and help them find a more peaceful way through thehri own lives.	sadness	1	6	1	32	75000	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	114	33	0.15555555555555556	0.13333333333333333	0.08888888888888889	0.044444444444444446	0.06666666666666667	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.08888888888888889	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.047619047619047616	2.9435562990655915	2.9007473278839244	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	sadness	1	2	5	29	26000	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	76	35	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.022727272727272728	0.18181818181818182	0.1590909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.11363636363636363	0.022727272727272728	0.05555555555555555	2.8295488007595484	2.8263175392595756	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000$.

Two months after starting my first year of highschool, boys started treating me like a prostitute.  My “friend” at the time told everyone that I enjoyed the rape. That I wanted it. I was called a whore and a slut by my peers. Older boys attempted to have their way with me. I started acting like one. I sent nudes to anyone that would ask. I believed I was only needed for sex, that I wasn’t worth anything other than my sexual appeal. I was 13.  I was self harming any chance I could. My wrists, legs and chest were full of cuts. Eventually self harming didn’t help anymore. I didn’t want to live anymore. The thing that pushed me over the edge was when my “friend” invited me to a group chat with her minions.

I can't imagine what it's like to leave the house every day not knowing if you will come back, or of living in fear of letting your children leave the house to go to school because they might not make it home.

As a gun supporter maybe I should take a step back and ask myself the hard questions about guns and there impact and availability in today's society. I know that statistically more people die from other causes compared to gun violence, but are guns way to accessible in America compared to other countries? When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today? Seeing so many mass shootings makes me feel that maybe it's time to change some of the gun laws and help make things like 40 children killed or injured a thing of the past.	sadness	1	4	1	30	30000	6.5	6.5	6.5	7.0	6.0	5.0	2.571	4.714	5.0	127	53	0.2391304347826087	0.1956521739130435	0.021739130434782608	0.021739130434782608	0.021739130434782608	0.043478260869565216	0.2608695652173913	0.15217391304347827	0.021739130434782608	0.021739130434782608	0.0	3.0509959156563773	2.9239883097345247	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 30000$.

They used the personal stories of a couple of people to show how the ready availability of guns contributes to sad situations in which kids are shot and killed. It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.	sadness	1	6	5	43	50000	6.5	4.5	1.5	5.5	6.0	3.714	1.429	3.571	2.857	64	64	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.0	0.36363636363636365	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	2.9553547417921835	2.881948487266132	medium	medium	An essay written by a 43 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

I heard about this really interesting study regarding the relationship between mothers and middle school aged children.  I have to say the findings rang true to me and brought back a lot of memories.  Middle school was a miserable time for me as I struggled with some classes and often felt either depressed or angry for no particular reason.  I remember feeling constantly stressed over both academics and the challenges of middle school social life with maintaining friendships, cliques, dating etc.	sadness	1	6	1	31	40000	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.571	5.0	4.857	91	65	0.06060606060606061	0.12121212121212122	0.06060606060606061	0.18181818181818182	0.030303030303030304	0.18181818181818182	0.12121212121212122	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.06060606060606061	0.043478260869565216	2.908039987217236	2.6621998825421183	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

The poachers sell to international buyers, so the governments of other countries should step in and help the Indian people combat these poachers. There should be a negative stigma on using any products made with tiger parts so that people would feel ashamed to contribute to this sordid smuggling trade.	sadness	1	4	1	64	27000	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	72	66	0.1388888888888889	0.1388888888888889	0.027777777777777776	0.05555555555555555	0.027777777777777776	0.08333333333333333	0.25	0.1388888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.027777777777777776	0.05	2.9386127845629475	2.990154104736487	medium	medium	An essay written by a 64 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

I mean, how terrible it must be!  Though details aren't completely clear, it sounds as if the son had some issues that weren't completely dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad.  How terrible to have to carry this with him the rest of forever.  It would break my heart in two.  I hope he gets deep counseling for his grief and guilt.

Should that not be taken into account when thinking about the possibility that maybe not everyone should actually have that right?

Otherwise it’s just another sad story out of so many others like it in the world.	sadness	1	6	1	35	70000	7.0	7.0	4.0	1.5	7.0	4.857	1.0	1.714	1.0	58	80	0.037037037037037035	0.07407407407407407	0.07407407407407407	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037035	0.18518518518518517	0.18518518518518517	0.14814814814814814	0.037037037037037035	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.9180417913946335	2.770430251087009	medium	low	An essay written by a 35 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000$.

Some of them did not want to leave and now they can't get out at all. There are barely any medical services at all. Hardly anything to help with all the old age medical conditions that show up later in life. These people don't have enough food. They are scared they will die alone. I don't think many people have thought about this. I am so heartbroken for those people. I wish I could help them. Syria is such a mess. I pray somehow this can all come to a end soon. Too many deaths have occurred. These older people never thought they would have to live like this. Everything was normal until the war for them.  I think more people need to know about the older people living in Syria. They are just left there to suffer.	sadness	2	2	1	36	91000	5.5	6.0	6.0	6.5	4.5	4.0	2.714	3.286	4.857	154	82	0.15384615384615385	0.02564102564102564	0.1282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.05128205128205128	0.10256410256410256	0.15384615384615385	0.15384615384615385	0.05128205128205128	0.05128205128205128	0.043478260869565216	2.737493581909863	2.569791795050914	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 91000$.

He is been owned by a guy and held in chains. He used Nosey to perform for public entertainment in circuses and forced for most of her life to give rides to adults and children  across the United States. Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being. The owner has been cited numerous times but in the same time his license was still approved for renewal each year.

Someone hit a trailer that was pulling people on a highway. Several people were injured, but three were killed. Authorities say that the three killed were related to one another. That is so sad and breaks my heart. It was most likely a family, a mother and her kids, or a father and his kids. It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened. The article did not say if the driver who caused the accident was drunk or on drugs. I wish people were more alert while on the road. Accidents like this are completely preventable.

How could they just blatantly violate people in this way?  I suppose it is hopeful that we might learn from this, correct mistakes, but that doesn't mitigate the harm that was done!  It also doesn't bode well that protecting the victims now, after the fact, also seems to be in question.  The assumption that they were informed of the release of the data, I think, is reckless.  Verification that the already suffering victims won't be further victimized is as important as the far reaching implications of the data itself!  I wonder why there is no mention of the ramifications to the department either.  Just releasing the data is great, but what about investigations and punishments?	sadness	2	6	1	47	26000	4.5	7.0	2.5	7.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	133	134	0.16129032258064516	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.16129032258064516	0.1935483870967742	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.05263157894736842	2.6161303455165705	2.6671224295281113	low	medium	An essay written by a 47 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 26000$.

Governments and scientists should do more to prevent these kinds of deaths: at least to have certain warning systems installed. Also, natural disasters such as hails and typhoons can wreck a havoc in peoples’ lives. Now I have second thoughts about traveling to South Pasific islands. They are gorgeous but dangerous.	sadness	2	7	1	45	120000	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	84	147	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.7889244873273875	2.723810155721139	medium	medium	An essay written by a 45 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000$.

It sucks that they had to shoot the gorilla, but it didn't know what it was doing to hurt the kid and it seemed like there was no choice but to kill him. It must have been an awful downer for the zoo visitors who expected to have a relaxing and fun day of leisure. In my opinion the zoo should have given the visitors present at the shooting a coupon for a future visit or something like that to ease the downer.	sadness	2	4	1	28	8000	2.0	6.5	3.5	3.5	2.0	2.714	3.429	3.143	4.143	102	149	0.13333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.08888888888888889	0.044444444444444446	0.044444444444444446	0.15555555555555556	0.2	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.06666666666666667	0.041666666666666664	2.7411211748985354	2.638199688877224	medium	low	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 8000$.

The recent spate of mass shootings at schools and other locations underline the presence of disturbed people in our midst. Besides defending ourselves, we need to ask ourselves what in our society is provoking this disturbing behavior. Certainly the ubiquity and ease of acquiring guns is one cause, but there may be others that need attention as well.	sadness	1	4	1	64	27000	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	86	153	0.0	0.08695652173913043	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.34782608695652173	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.08695652173913043	0.1111111111111111	3.0953340775437375	3.062219573838766	medium	medium	An essay written by a 64 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.

It's so sad to hear about these beautiful farms and nurseries just being gutted and destroyed.  The farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do.  The farms are gone.  It sounded as if some of the elders in the community tried to calm things down, and it worked in some areas, but other areas just raged on with riots and destruction.

Totally sucks for people who are just trying to live their lives peacefully.	sadness	1	4	5	29	25000	4.5	6.0	4.5	4.5	6.0	4.2860000000000005	2.143	3.286	4.143	61	180	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.16666666666666666	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.25	3.0530713489176926	2.9702080279512617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 25000$.

This world cares way to much about money. If we didn't care to much about money we would have less problems going on. I honestly feel this world is coming to an end. I don't see any improvements or feel there is going to be any improvements. There is more natural disasters, new diseases, obesity, cancer more and more people are dying. So many people need mental help a lot of us are very depressed and anxious. I think it is very important for us to stay closer to god.	sadness	2	2	2	23	12000	5.0	4.5	3.0	5.0	4.5	4.571000000000001	2.571	4.428999999999999	4.428999999999999	118	181	0.11904761904761904	0.11904761904761904	0.11904761904761904	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.09523809523809523	0.14285714285714285	0.11904761904761904	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.0	2.836677306528333	2.6860693019809134	medium	low	An essay written by a 23 years old hispanic or latino female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000$.

I know it's just an article but hearing about all the bad in the world is just an assured way to get a poor start to the day. I was mostly wondering what the situation was where Richard Hong was killed in the Los Angeles home. Whos home was it and why was George Stroumbolopoulos there. I'd like to know the more intricate details of what went down in this crime. Was it a murder of passion or was it cold blooded. Was it in the moment or was it calculated. What will happen now, hopefully and investigation can uncover this.	sadness	1	6	4	26	34000	6.5	6.5	5.0	4.0	7.0	3.429	2.143	3.286	2.714	120	183	0.10256410256410256	0.10256410256410256	0.1282051282051282	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.10256410256410256	0.1794871794871795	0.10256410256410256	0.07692307692307693	0.05128205128205128	0.09090909090909091	2.649412042804734	2.496910524457104	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old native american or american indian male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 34000$.

I feel so very sad and alarmed for them, as I know the citizens are helpless and don't know who to turn to for help. It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2	2	1	40	85000	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	152	186	0.19444444444444445	0.027777777777777776	0.1388888888888889	0.08333333333333333	0.027777777777777776	0.1111111111111111	0.19444444444444445	0.1111111111111111	0.027777777777777776	0.08333333333333333	0.043478260869565216	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000$.

It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.

But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.

One's status in life should not leave them any more open to suffering than others.	sadness	1	6	3	22	150000	4.0	6.0	5.0	6.0	5.5	3.143	3.0	3.143	2.143	60	213	0.12	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.16	0.16	0.04	0.07692307692307693	2.7667384564494095	2.6073966144868406	low	low	An essay written by a 22 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 150000$.

There were three U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base, fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base. I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol. They have had serious problems in Jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossing their border. Jordan is and has been a significant U.S. ally in the war against ISIS and I can only hope that this incident is isolated and not part of a bigger problem.

Clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so unbearable that they are willing to risk their own and their families' lives to try for a different life in another country, with no guarantee that life there would be an improvement.  Its difficult to understand.  Life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance, which I suppose is something difficult for the typical American to picture.  I'm glad that we live in a country where there are relative freedoms and the individual and his or her family can live independently and get their needs met and wants.

Children passing out in the streets simply because they have no food to eat is heartbreaking. No one should have to suffer simply because they can't afford food. There needs to be another option.	sadness	2	6	1	25	75000	7.0	7.0	4.5	6.5	6.5	4.143	2.4290000000000003	3.571	4.428999999999999	64	248	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2	0.0	0.4	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.06666666666666667	0.2	0.0	2.8384798246330862	2.8852451856284387	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

It told the story of a young teenage girl in India named Insha Mushtaq. She lost her vision and 14 years old because she was shot repeatedly with pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for months trying to regain her vision, but so far it has not been successful. She is trying to stay positive now but she knows that she has a difficult road ahead of her. I hope that she regains her sight.	sadness	1	2	5	29	26000	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	91	249	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.25806451612903225	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.0	0.12903225806451613	0.06666666666666667	2.9758361924049703	2.7731603227470796	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000$.

I don't think giving them more information on these dangers will stop them, but patrolling the waters and turning these human traffickers back will.

Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.	sadness	2	6	5	33	51000	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	145	256	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.041666666666666664	2.883141101795506	2.6395763754432755	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000$.

When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.  Nothing different is happening in the Middle East.  We always hear that might makes right but that's not truly the case.  Might makes blight and generations suffer till most of it is forgotten.

This stuff is so ridiculous and it adds such a mysterious cloak to it because western journalists aren't really allowed in myanmar. It just seems other wordly that all this violence and just chaos is going on. Not really even that far away, sure it's the other side of the planet but these crimes and disrespect of human rights is happening one way or another. What would you do in the situation if you were one of the innocent people stuck in the middle of it?	sadness	1	6	1	27	52000	7.0	6.0	5.0	6.5	6.0	4.571000000000001	1.143	2.143	4.714	133	265	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.9573092851592797	2.981730912293579	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 52000$.

We only see things from our side of the pond, and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do, as a country.  We tend to think of things, in generalities, and lump groups of people who live in a common area, into one pile of terrorists.  There are plenty of people in Afghanistan who are against eh taliban, and we dont see the damage that we are doing by hitting them with drone strikes.  Most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the conflict itself.  There are always conflicting stories about the death tolls.

Humans are always working they have no life. Work is not life. Some people don't get to spend time with there kids or family. They cant even have time for themselves. There worried about work, what time they have to get up, or what they will eat because they don't have time to cook. So we eat unhealthy thing that can lead to depression. Not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients lead to sicknesses. Theres people who don't have enough time to see a doctor. Our lifestyle is the reason we're not getting enough sleep.

While California passed clean water acts to remedy this, it has had trouble providing for the poor in unincorporated areas such as Methany Tract (sp?).  But California has recognized that having access to clean water is a right for all people.  Currently they are working on having a nearby city help provide clean water to the Methany Tract citizens.  It really makes one wonder about all the damage already done, the health problems, the children, and it makes one wonder how many other places and other states need to have this resolved.	sadness	2	6	1	58	40000	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	108	269	0.0	0.03225806451612903	0.0967741935483871	0.25806451612903225	0.0	0.2903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.22580645161290322	0.05263157894736842	3.0185358322640456	2.6814993052335363	medium	medium	An essay written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

We don't often let how a crisis in countries can affect animals cross our minds, we typically only think of the people. Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable. Such as cats, and dogs, and even going as far as to steal horses from racetracks simply to eat them, or to feed them to animals at the local zoos.

I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	149	284	0.20689655172413793	0.06896551724137931	0.034482758620689655	0.10344827586206896	0.034482758620689655	0.13793103448275862	0.20689655172413793	0.13793103448275862	0.034482758620689655	0.034482758620689655	0.0	2.785816318850275	2.7220543145719054	medium	low	An essay written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern. I am really worried about the outcome for these bears.

What upsets me the most about reading it is thinking about their families. I wonder if they had children that will have to grow up without them. I think about wives and their parents and how those peoples' lives have now changed forever. I think about how upset I would be if my son grew up to join the military. I would be a mess.	sadness	2	6	1	29	50000	5.5	4.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	2.0	3.0	2.286	3.0	79	297	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.25	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.0	2.8256757861803816	2.866759322180743	low	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	136	306	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.18181818181818182	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

I am not too concerned with affairs in other countries unless it is about war or peace and political things. Packing up and having to move your live away in just a few days is very hard and i guess i feel some sympathy about that.	sadness	1	2	1	33	30000	3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	4.5	2.714	3.429	3.571	2.571	69	314	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.10714285714285714	0.10714285714285714	0.14285714285714285	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.16666666666666666	2.920800225875773	2.6179579039565204	medium	low	An essay written by a 33 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 30000$.

The truth to me is, all the Republican party did to win was take advantage of disenfranchised people who are tired of things that happened ten years ago and beyond, so they looked to the only people who would listen to them, even if they were wrong.	sadness	1	4	1	30	50000	3.5	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.714	79	316	0.07142857142857142	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.21428571428571427	0.42857142857142855	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.912499438001141	2.88816498719028	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

According to UNICEF, there is a simple vaccine that can be given, which would stop children from being affected.  It affects most children in poor countries, which is very sad.  The vaccine isn’t that expensive and you would think that the leaders of all countries would get together and do something about this problem.  It is not just up to the USA to stand up and do something.  These other countries (even though they are poor) need to get more educated and help protect their own children and citizens in their own country.  It is sad that children and others have to die because we can’t coordinate with each other, to get the vaccines to those who need it most.

The Iraqi forces are advancing against them and as a result, ISIS carried out mass killings, punishing people who had defied its orders. They are even forcing women to wear gloves to completely cover themselves, and accusing anyone who has even a cell phone of being a spy. It seems they are growing increasingly desperate and determined to take the lives and freedom of everyone in their path without regard to civility or even basic humanity.

It seems that human nature is causing these animals to be subjected to lives they shouldn't have to endure. If they were released into nature then maybe they would have a fighting chance but at the same time, most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their ""social skills"" in nature may be quite the detriment as well. I just wish that some organization(s) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be. No animal should really have to live in a zoo, to begin with, and now they are suffering from malnourishment and lack of care.

The elevator company has to be at fault here, but that won't bring her back! I can't imagine how her parents must feel, looking at my little boy and wondering what it would be like if we lost him in such a horrible -- yet preventable -- tragedy. I feel so bad for the parents, but I wonder if they could have prevented it somehow, and if so, it would be hard not to blame them somewhat for what happened. But that isn't to deflect guilt over how horrible they must feel, as no one wants to lose their child in such an egregious tragedy.

I feel so bad for Kesha because she simply became a victim of the music industry and lost her voice in the process. Dr. Luke should be ashamed of himself for treating Kesha so badly and trying to make her into something that she wasn't. I'm glad that she got the help that she needed and is making strides toward her own recovery.	sadness	2	6	1	27	25000	5.5	4.5	2.0	5.5	2.5	2.857	3.714	1.714	2.0	76	347	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.21739130434782608	0.2608695652173913	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.07692307692307693	2.7902581590009756	2.6919993570228464	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000$.

When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

It is so easy to take someone's money but then you do not give them the safety that they paid for.

That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place. That reminds me of the fire that happened at my neighbors house.	sadness	1	6	1	28	100000	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	149	394	0.24444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.08888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.08888888888888889	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.08333333333333333	3.0210370860408338	2.9018071502690783	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000$.

Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned.

In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view.

They had absolutely no reason to attack this guy. I would like to see the villagers fairly punished for their terrible behavior. Can you give me a hand and pass this along to everybody on your friends list? I know it isn't much, but I think that if we work really hard together, we might be able to get enough support to make sure that the poachers are punished. At any rate, we should at least try to raise the money to help this injured guy.	sadness	2	6	1	25	55000	4.5	6.0	3.5	6.0	5.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	4.0	4.571000000000001	105	413	0.13157894736842105	0.15789473684210525	0.07894736842105263	0.07894736842105263	0.02631578947368421	0.10526315789473684	0.15789473684210525	0.13157894736842105	0.07894736842105263	0.05263157894736842	0.0	2.7551457388149982	2.7374301424406444	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

Sometimes I feel like the people that disagree with scientists and real evidence that global warming is very obvious today is just very ignorant and live in a bubble where they think that everything is fine in the world and everyone is at peace. There are so many reasons why we should be using fewer resources as it is constantly destroying our environment and it is unfortunate that there are people who just continue to deplete our resources without a care in the world. Maybe the effects won't be felt as much in our generation but I am sure that the effects will be felt by those others after us sadly.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	151	414	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.2702702702702703	0.0	0.21621621621621623	0.16216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.0	2.8851050612555498	2.8665030936928537	low	low	An essay written by a 24 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000$.

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	141	421	0.3	0.0	0.15	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.35	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.041666666666666664	2.7563821399188324	2.634527420010074	medium	medium	An essay written by a 49 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000$.

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention.

The article says that Trump and the congress are going to undo what Obama started. The article says that they are also trying to undo Obama care and that’s part of it.  I know Obamacare made me poorer by about $600 a month and I’m not rich!  It goes on about SS and how evil tax cuts are.  I don’t know what to think about this since the news these days are often fiction.  It seems to contradict itself by saying unemployment rates have dropped.

I just read an article on the Matthew and the destruction it left in Haiti. I was overwhelmed and I almost cannot believe how many people were affected and not just that but they were suffering from all kinds of unimaginable things. Hunger was the first to list, there was a lot a starvation, people were poring from all over when aid was coming to bring them food aid with trucks. Disease was everywhere, doctors coming from all over the world had to face with cholera and disease. Infrastructure was damaged, homes destroyed. It is really hard to express in words all the suffering the people had to deal with.

Normally an article like this might not attract my attention and cause me to read any further, but this particular forest land is home to the 3rd largest population of endangered orangutans and if the forest is cut down, it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will die or have to be rescued and re-homed. This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong. How can the government in Indonesia think that this idea is even a possibility, never mind the fact it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the negative impact it has on this species!!	sadness	2	5	1	28	62000	7.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	4.0	2.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	142	452	0.14814814814814814	0.037037037037037035	0.07407407407407407	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037035	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.037037037037037035	0.0	3.069056603956622	3.014447902048003	medium	medium	An essay written by a 28 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000$.

That being said I understand why the authorities would want to ban people who practice risky lifestyles from donating blood.  The last thing we want is to have a blood supply that's contaminated with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in risky lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well.

It affects genes and ranges in species. More than eighty percent of ecosystems are being put under stress. It makes me sad because we don't know the long-standing implications in the largest perspective.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is.

It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through. My mom is always worried when I go backpacking and she'd go crazy if anything like this happened to me.	sadness	1	4	1	42	105000	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	154	483	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.17647058823529413	0.23529411764705882	0.20588235294117646	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.041666666666666664	2.682485542394438	2.5507018080557495	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000$.

I wonder how a town can meaningfully bounce back and rebuild their lives. I don't know what I would do if this happened to me. Move? Work on recreating the city? Turn to the government for hope?

Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2	6	1	32	50000	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	141	497	0.08163265306122448	0.061224489795918366	0.12244897959183673	0.04081632653061224	0.04081632653061224	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.12244897959183673	0.10204081632653061	0.061224489795918366	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.

As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have.

You have to stop and think how this can be affecting these said animals. Public access to wild animals in their natural environment can drop birth rates and even cause death to the animals. They can become endangered and some people even go as far as to hunt them.	neutral	1	4	1	25	50000	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	67	598	0.15	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.15	0.1	0.2	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.0	3.388156225059331	3.200219074898676	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	151	603	0.18181818181818182	0.06060606060606061	0.06060606060606061	0.030303030303030304	0.09090909090909091	0.06060606060606061	0.24242424242424243	0.18181818181818182	0.06060606060606061	0.030303030303030304	0.043478260869565216	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	120	635	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.0752753371419286	2.907461098664972	low	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

Maybe he doesn't want the whole world to know if he's going through something.	neutral	2	4	1	44	17000	7.0	5.0	1.5	4.5	4.0	3.143	1.429	3.286	3.857	76	667	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	2.292119248521147	2.1602149234598182	low	low	An essay written by a 44 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 17000$.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	141	677	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	medium	An essay written by a 52 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

The article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed acceptable, but men are not accustomed to ceding convenience for responsibility, are used to women taking control in this area.	neutral	1	6	1	47	30000	6.5	5.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.4290000000000003	4.714	4.571000000000001	83	701	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.0	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.0	2.883244988785839	2.813088766055183	low	medium	An essay written by a 47 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1	6	3	30	40000	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	87	727	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

Neocons should just admit to being big government centrists so we can all move on.	neutral	2	2	2	34	65000	6.0	6.0	3.5	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.714	4.0	4.0	70	736	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.2727272727272727	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.409108108556488	2.4457966789808956	low	low	An essay written by a 34 years old hispanic or latino female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 65000$.

It is very fortunate that we live in a time where doctors can assist individuals with such issues, so people should really seek help.	fear	1	6	1	30	45000	6.0	6.0	1.0	5.5	7.0	4.857	1.714	3.0	2.4290000000000003	63	753	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.0	2.94866815845029	2.894836302036614	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000$.

I feel so blessed that I live in a state where I don’t fear earthquakes, or severe tornado warnings, flash floods or major disasters. Of course Vermont has had our issues and weather events that caused damage, however we’re not in a region of the world where we fear for our lives at certain months of the year. I could not imagine being terrified for my children, property, and family like some of these families are.

The crime has been increasingly more dangerous within the past few years. According to this article that I read online, a police officer was shot to death and another police officer was injured in an ambush. I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	fear	1	6	3	24	55000	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	7.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	3.143	118	770	0.20833333333333334	0.125	0.041666666666666664	0.08333333333333333	0.08333333333333333	0.14583333333333334	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.91722408565792	2.8410753633042187	medium	medium	An essay written by a 24 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 55000$.

Could you imagine? The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish!

These types of incidents happen so often I'm rather numb to their effects.	fear	1	4	1	38	17000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	62	786	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.593679417084438	2.512063762590276	low	medium	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 17000$.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	787	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.0	0.16129032258064516	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

Maybe find an organization to donate time and money too. I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.

The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	fear	1	6	3	36	40000	7.0	5.5	1.5	6.0	5.5	4.714	2.857	3.714	4.428999999999999	162	805	0.15789473684210525	0.13157894736842105	0.10526315789473684	0.15789473684210525	0.02631578947368421	0.18421052631578946	0.13157894736842105	0.07894736842105263	0.0	0.02631578947368421	0.030303030303030304	3.074889281869577	2.774841346826427	medium	low	An essay written by a 36 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

Apparently a lot of people are thinking that this could be foul play and it wouldn't be a surprise since the Russian government is known for doing this sort of thing all the time. He was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal government which would have angered the Russian government so I bet they killed him off so that they could avoid him giving away information to the federal government.	fear	1	6	1	28	100000	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	103	821	0.25806451612903225	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.16129032258064516	0.22580645161290322	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.04	2.660010450956814	2.6312349582327843	low	low	An essay written by a 28 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000$.

It's very dry, and I don't understand half the words, but while I was reading it, I was feeling sort of glad that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate. It seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to adapt. And then I read the last bit, about humans and agriculture, and got cold all over again. Will we adapt, too? I gotta say, at this point, I'm hoping that volcano in Hawaii spews a gazillion tons of ash (after everyone's been evacuated, of course) into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool things down.

I would much prefer to stick with glasses. What particularly concerns me is the potential for scarring on the cornea and any possible loss of visual acuity. Frankly, I don't like the idea of sticking something in my eye to begin with, and this has turned me off from contact lenses forever.	fear	1	4	1	39	48000	6.5	7.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.143	2.143	4.0	4.428999999999999	71	836	0.23076923076923078	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.3076923076923077	0.23076923076923078	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.8385332220599504	2.622831385171249	low	low	An essay written by a 39 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 48000$.

The way I see it, it was obvious that the guy was decompensating in some way, but he didn't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head. Yes, when the cops order you to do something, it's probably better to comply, especially if they have draw weapons including tasers. No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim. People wonder why the police aren't trusted, and this is it. They're human too, and they make mistakes, but their mistakes kill people unjustly. I feel bad for the family of the victim and I hope they see justice done.	fear	1	6	1	44	49000	5.5	5.5	1.0	4.5	2.5	4.143	3.857	3.571	4.2860000000000005	147	843	0.1956521739130435	0.10869565217391304	0.021739130434782608	0.15217391304347827	0.043478260869565216	0.15217391304347827	0.15217391304347827	0.10869565217391304	0.043478260869565216	0.021739130434782608	0.047619047619047616	2.767285481580338	2.747451182835108	medium	medium	An essay written by a 44 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

I guess it doesn’t contain much new research, but still it has made waves by collating an array of available literature suggesting that climate change will have a major effect on the world’s coffee supply.

I'm really worried about getting bit by an infected mosquito and then getting pregnant. I wouldn't want anything to happen to my baby. This person thinks that we should just put girls in a room with infected mosquito's and let them get bit. I don't think you can prevent immunity that way. I don't think this virus is just going to disappear. I think something has to be done to prevent it from infecting more people. It needs to be controlled. I think it is sad for those that have already gotten the virus.

The people are literally starving to death and the injured and sick do not have access to enough, if any medical care.  There are areas that are completely inaccessible to aid, either medically or food or water supplies.  There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.    What concerns me is living situations that are unhealthy for economic reasons, and psychological problems concerning motivation.  I suspect some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a professional.	fear	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	107	874	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.3181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.05	2.711924288560362	2.5750055832217167	medium	low	An essay written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

Do I think Kim by posting the pics made someone want to rob her? No, but I think it's probably best to be more modest about what you post. I mean, just for safeties sake. I agree, I'd be scared to post about Tristan's ring too especially since it wasn't so long ago that Kim was robbed. Yes, I'm sure everything is insured, but it's still a scary experience and I'd do everything I could to avoid it.	fear	2	4	3	33	60000	6.5	6.5	4.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	3.0	4.714	4.857	104	888	0.11538461538461539	0.15384615384615385	0.07692307692307693	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.11538461538461539	0.19230769230769232	0.07692307692307693	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.08333333333333333	2.283282633789956	2.1927734489412543	low	low	An essay written by a 33 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.	fear	2	6	1	32	68000	7.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	6.5	5.0	1.429	4.714	5.0	118	891	0.23809523809523808	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.0	3.0356098245975915	2.9107046641393266	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 68000$.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

I'm not the biggest environmentalist and sometimes I ignore the whole climate change thing, but I do believe it is happening and know that our government needs to do something about it. I have no faith in our current government to do anything, but I hope others around the world will and we as individuals can do something, even little things. Maybe doing things collaboratively can help change things for the better.	anger	2	5	3	44	38000	7.0	5.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	3.857	3.0	5.0	3.714	89	904	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.23529411764705882	0.0	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.13333333333333333	2.662611965235228	2.6075501035997326	low	low	An essay written by a 44 years old black or african american female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 38000$.

Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here.

Poverty, disease, no regulations when it comes to the environmental safety standards. My heart goes out to these people because they deserve to live in peace on this Earth and be healthy and prosperous just like everyone else. Such a blatant disregard for human life! India is like hell in Earth. I would lock up these government people in solitary confinement for life and let the fly ash befall on their heads so they can find out what getting tuberculosis and liver decease is like for these poor people!  The situation in India just never ends, makes you wonder where all these mega wealthy Indian royals are?!!!

And all this just because of some issues he was having where he worked, like it is so hard for a lawyer to just move on to another firm instead of going crazy and shooting up innocent people.	anger	1	5	1	54	16000	1.0	7.0	1.5	1.5	2.0	2.857	2.857	4.2860000000000005	1.0	71	954	0.21212121212121213	0.21212121212121213	0.0	0.030303030303030304	0.030303030303030304	0.06060606060606061	0.24242424242424243	0.12121212121212122	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	2.7688883458290983	2.769655818090209	medium	medium	An essay written by a 54 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

The orangantans who number seven fifty to seventeen fifty will be completly wiped out if the company that is clearing this land is allowed to continue. What can we do to form a protest  or let the government know that this is not right.Can you help me with some ideas?   Maybe we email the indonesian government first or attempt to call them. After that maybe we can plan to picket or have a demonstration at the capitol building voicing our concerns. Do you feel the same about this that I do? if you dont I will get someone else to help me or I will go it alone.  I just feel so strongly that something productive needs to be done and fast.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	134	995	0.06976744186046512	0.023255813953488372	0.06976744186046512	0.16279069767441862	0.023255813953488372	0.32558139534883723	0.13953488372093023	0.09302325581395349	0.0	0.09302325581395349	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	medium	medium	An essay written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

These companies seem to want to be your best friend to get you to buy a timeshare, but once you do they do not care about you, your family, or what situation your life is in. They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of. Although they may say that they have an easy process to relinquish, but after undercover investigations, that proved to be wrong.

It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore.

The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	128	1033	0.1	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.2	0.23333333333333334	0.1	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.043478260869565216	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	medium	low	An essay written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

We feel more insecure with officers around than safe, and still they can kill people and get away with it.	anger	2	6	2	23	30000	3.5	7.0	1.0	6.0	2.0	4.714	4.428999999999999	3.714	4.714	58	1036	0.21875	0.15625	0.0	0.03125	0.03125	0.03125	0.28125	0.1875	0.03125	0.03125	0.0	2.9437373926308417	3.082454822397337	medium	medium	An essay written by a 23 years old hispanic or latino female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

The kitten was wrapped so tightly, it's little legs were close to it's face. It made me cry. It is horrifying to think people that are capable of this exist.

The way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane. I understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in prison as their punishment, but there needs to be accountability for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals. Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons. We seriously need to do something about these conditions.	anger	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	126	1056	0.13043478260869565	0.21739130434782608	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.1	2.887471641540525	2.935960670048317	medium	low	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

He stated he would pull all troops out, but that never really happened.

Next if you are not your best or at 100% you really can not give your all.	anger	2	2	1	39	74500	3.5	7.0	6.5	7.0	4.5	3.714	3.143	3.714	4.428999999999999	108	1121	0.12121212121212122	0.09090909090909091	0.12121212121212122	0.09090909090909091	0.030303030303030304	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.06060606060606061	0.09090909090909091	0.12121212121212122	0.06666666666666667	3.074892392888611	2.8378041785147436	medium	medium	An essay written by a 39 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74500$.

They could have done alot of good for their fans, but then it just became more of a cheap laugh. The people that lost their jobs on Sally Jesse Raphael had families they supported. After being told the show would be renewed, it was a harsh blow to find out that wasn't the case.

He has a tendency to act like a child, but that would be a far stretch, even for him.	anger	2	6	1	32	30000	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	114	1137	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.0	0.08695652173913043	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.0	2.370291908134794	2.4605822732488725	low	low	An essay written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into.

I do have sympathy for some of the prisoners who may not particularly be terrorist. From an article I read some of these prisoners or most of them are mentally ill. One thing I learned from this article I read is that some of the psychologists may be assisting with torturing the prisoners.

I think that it should not be difficult for people to conduct themselves appropriately, so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events.	anger	2	6	1	29	62000	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	107	1155	0.1	0.05	0.2	0.15	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.05	0.05	0.043478260869565216	2.495359342425146	2.493830002598717	low	low	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000$.

It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1	7	1	47	54000	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	106	1156	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.3592816924650135	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	136	1166	0.13333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.044444444444444446	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.08888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.09090909090909091	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	medium	low	An essay written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

Maryland drivers suck.

And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct.

Instead of exploring other alternatives, such as natural energy sources, they will go and march their way to Africa and claim innocent lives just to put money in their pockets. I wonder if the majesty Queen, the mighty Queen of England, would appreciate of someone suddenly marched into her palace and started drilling for oil?!!! Absolutely disturbing-total disregard for nature and living creatures, nothing but pure greed regardless of the cost!	disgust	1	3	1	46	29000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	4.143	2.714	5.0	5.0	94	1185	0.08571428571428572	0.11428571428571428	0.05714285714285714	0.17142857142857143	0.05714285714285714	0.2	0.14285714285714285	0.02857142857142857	0.05714285714285714	0.08571428571428572	0.047619047619047616	2.877824993844638	2.85906604492951	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 29000$.

The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.	disgust	1	4	1	26	35000	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	95	1187	0.10638297872340426	0.1276595744680851	0.06382978723404255	0.14893617021276595	0.06382978723404255	0.10638297872340426	0.1702127659574468	0.06382978723404255	0.10638297872340426	0.0425531914893617	0.09090909090909091	2.9422282048245303	3.000730637576451	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000$.

I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach.

How awful that people choose to do this to each other and how awful that some poor kid had to be a witness to it all. That child will never be the same again. I wonder why people who choose to do something like this can't just kill themselves and leave everyone around them alone.

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1	6	5	31	75000	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	115	1207	0.10714285714285714	0.21428571428571427	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.25	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers.

It's bad enough to know that i am eating an animal but to know it suffered makes it worse.  While the story is about the the suffering of an animal at the end of it's life it seems to ignore the suffering that the chicken goes through 99.9% of the time it is alive.

It's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything foreign to them as a threat. They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference. I would prefer to just die, than put up with such cruel disgusting people. I am disgusted with my country of Americans.

That unnecessary force was used to handle the situation. Its crazy that the first thing on the police mind is to shoot to kill. I feel uneasy every time seeing and reading about situation like this where a situation could of been handled in a different way.

There are more important things in life than money and oil.	disgust	2	6	1	31	32000	6.0	3.5	4.5	6.0	5.5	4.428999999999999	3.429	4.571000000000001	4.571000000000001	60	1267	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.10526315789473684	0.21052631578947367	0.10526315789473684	0.2631578947368421	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.15789473684210525	0.07692307692307693	3.0261279038995057	2.739867333382548	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 32000$.

Between a live chicken and the package you buy at the grocery store lies a world of torture. The inhumane way some of our food, particularly chicken, makes it's way to our dinner plate is beyond disturbing.

The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	disgust	1	6	5	42	88000	6.5	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.857	3.857	3.857	132	1269	0.2608695652173913	0.1956521739130435	0.021739130434782608	0.08695652173913043	0.021739130434782608	0.10869565217391304	0.1956521739130435	0.043478260869565216	0.06521739130434782	0.0	0.0	2.7205698332861603	2.84023786483235	medium	medium	An essay written by a 42 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 88000$.

Can people heal once they see that? Do those people have any hope or any way to continue after they witness such atrocities? What about the children? I feel so bad for them. It's so crazy.

Especially since these people gave over their passwords willingly, it's hard to understand the legal precedent for sending someone to jail over this.	surprise	1	4	1	20	350000	6.5	5.0	4.0	3.5	3.0	3.857	2.4290000000000003	4.0	3.286	63	1318	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	0.1875	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.6674178097747547	2.7370866100166245	low	low	An essay written by a 20 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 350000$.

It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1	3	1	33	58000	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	144	1404	0.03773584905660377	0.09433962264150944	0.1509433962264151	0.20754716981132076	0.09433962264150944	0.16981132075471697	0.05660377358490566	0.05660377358490566	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.06451612903225806	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000$.

How we treated these people is horrible, and I'm not sure whether I'm more upset or just feel bad for the Americans who went along with it. It sort of reminds me of the SS officers during WWII- like at some point it seems like they all realized what they were doing wasn't kosher and definitely crossing ethical boundaries. Yet they all continued because .... why?

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits. I hope that men will earn more fair wages in the future.	surprise	1	4	1	34	42000	6.5	7.0	6.5	6.5	4.0	4.857	2.714	4.857	5.0	101	1407	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.029411764705882353	0.3235294117647059	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.14705882352941177	0.07142857142857142	2.5658764917695356	2.5581719609054616	low	low	An essay written by a 34 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 42000$.

There should be some way to easily take food or even have someone come pick it up and then the food can go to needy starving people.	joy	2	2	1	29	40000	5.0	5.5	2.5	6.0	3.5	3.429	3.143	3.857	5.0	61	1437	0.0	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.23076923076923078	0.07692307692307693	0.3076923076923077	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.23076923076923078	0.15384615384615385	2.940131701618672	2.8531762668630094	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 40000$.

It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results.

The article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception versus reality. I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation.

These people have broken the law and are here illegally yet they expect to be treated just like US citizens.  DACA is a slap in the face to those immigrants who followed the law and went through the process to become legal citizens.

The story doesn't even mention that. And it talks about how he was working for the banks but also embraced Obama's position on banks, which seem like mutually exclusive things. He didn't do anything great in the Senate, but when he was governor, he saved that lady's daughter's college career.

Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy.

Im not a Trump supporter but I like the idea that he chose to save the government money.	joy	2	6	4	25	26000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.0	4.428999999999999	5.0	64	1470	0.10714285714285714	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.21428571428571427	0.03571428571428571	0.21428571428571427	0.10714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.17857142857142858	0.0	2.523259694657482	2.513909316999777	low	low	An essay written by a 25 years old native american or american indian female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 26000$.
