More effort should have been placed to ensure company's success. More companies should be encouraged to manufacture their products in our country while also making them affordable and appealing.	sadness	1	4	1	37	72000	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	54	0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	2.8230497805783212	2.7487222570305145	medium	low	An essay about the article 51, written by a 37 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000$.

I feel sorry for the employees, but its hard to feel sorry for the company since they just dont seem to get it.  I think one chance is fair, but when you have to declare bankruptcy again a year later your management doesnt seem to know what they are doing.  Maybe the company that bought them will finally get it right.	sadness	1	6	1	48	50000	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	3.857	1.0	4.857	4.143	82	1	0.1	0.1	0.05	0.1	0.1	0.15	0.1	0.1	0.15	0.05	0.1	2.9546518242991024	2.715416216493563	medium	medium	An essay about the article 51, written by a 48 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

Trump has been inciting racial hatred and tearing down standards of decent behaviour since before the beginning of his campaign.

It looks as though there were 13 civilians killed during this latest skirmish. It's pathetic to see so many innocent people being killed for no reason over this disputed land.

I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	sadness	1	4	1	34	55000	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	73	16	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.35714285714285715	0.14285714285714285	0.21428571428571427	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	2.570467739636896	2.441225217124561	low	low	An essay about the article 54, written by a 34 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000$.

It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through. My mom is always worried when I go backpacking and she'd go crazy if anything like this happened to me.	sadness	1	4	1	42	105000	6.0	5.0	1.0	5.0	4.5	3.571	1.571	4.143	3.714	154	56	0.058823529411764705	0.029411764705882353	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.17647058823529413	0.23529411764705882	0.20588235294117646	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.041666666666666664	2.682485542394438	2.5507018080557495	low	low	An essay about the article 42, written by a 42 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 105000$.

They need to sue them and anybody involved with this.  I cant believe that in today's society that tragedies like this are tolerated.  Somebody needs to go to jail for the death of this little girl and the injuries that her mother suffered. I cant imagine what the mother is going through and she probably blames herself.  Things like this should just not happen.	sadness	1	6	1	48	50000	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	7.0	3.857	1.0	4.857	4.143	93	98	0.08695652173913043	0.08695652173913043	0.15217391304347827	0.08695652173913043	0.021739130434782608	0.08695652173913043	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.043478260869565216	0.08695652173913043	0.0	2.9134452199111296	2.958884931316738	low	medium	An essay about the article 168, written by a 48 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

While California passed clean water acts to remedy this, it has had trouble providing for the poor in unincorporated areas such as Methany Tract (sp?).  But California has recognized that having access to clean water is a right for all people.  Currently they are working on having a nearby city help provide clean water to the Methany Tract citizens.

Someone hit a trailer that was pulling people on a highway. Several people were injured, but three were killed. Authorities say that the three killed were related to one another. That is so sad and breaks my heart. It was most likely a family, a mother and her kids, or a father and his kids. It really makes me sad when I read about it because I cannot help but imagine how much fun and excitement this family was experiencing before the accident happened. The article did not say if the driver who caused the accident was drunk or on drugs. I wish people were more alert while on the road. Accidents like this are completely preventable. And now three people are no longer with us.	sadness	1	6	1	31	50000	6.5	6.5	1.0	5.5	4.0	4.143	1.857	4.857	4.143	145	114	0.10344827586206896	0.034482758620689655	0.10344827586206896	0.10344827586206896	0.10344827586206896	0.13793103448275862	0.1724137931034483	0.13793103448275862	0.0	0.10344827586206896	0.09523809523809523	2.900049675668467	2.728814409621643	medium	medium	An essay about the article 355, written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.	sadness	2	2	1	60	74000	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	119	131	0.07894736842105263	0.07894736842105263	0.10526315789473684	0.05263157894736842	0.02631578947368421	0.05263157894736842	0.2631578947368421	0.10526315789473684	0.18421052631578946	0.05263157894736842	0.03225806451612903	3.0560606384819984	2.9285189771135838	medium	low	An essay about the article 302, written by a 60 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000$.

I heard about this really interesting study regarding the relationship between mothers and middle school aged children.  I have to say the findings rang true to me and brought back a lot of memories.  Middle school was a miserable time for me as I struggled with some classes and often felt either depressed or angry for no particular reason.  I remember feeling constantly stressed over both academics and the challenges of middle school social life with maintaining friendships, cliques, dating etc.	sadness	1	6	1	31	40000	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.857	1.571	5.0	4.857	91	132	0.06060606060606061	0.12121212121212122	0.06060606060606061	0.18181818181818182	0.030303030303030304	0.18181818181818182	0.12121212121212122	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.06060606060606061	0.043478260869565216	2.908039987217236	2.6621998825421183	medium	low	An essay about the article 217, written by a 31 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

It's such a shame to lose such a great man and great ball player.	sadness	1	5	1	39	39000	4.0	4.5	7.0	5.0	3.5	2.714	1.429	3.857	4.143	77	145	0.16666666666666666	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.25	0.16666666666666666	0.125	0.041666666666666664	0.0	2.6165991976245704	2.485469574405454	low	medium	An essay about the article 213, written by a 39 years old white male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 39000$.

I didn't know all that he went through as a child to get to America. It is sad when someone with such light and hope is killed either in an accident or by some jealous fan. I know he was really important to a lot of people. I am glad they decided to cancel the Braves game. Nobody is really going to be focused enough to play anyway.	sadness	2	6	1	40	31000	6.0	4.5	1.0	7.0	5.0	3.714	2.286	4.0	4.2860000000000005	87	146	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.18181818181818182	2.802018408739057	2.6122651443720715	medium	low	An essay about the article 213, written by a 40 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31000$.

She killed herself after a long suffering of depression. She repeatedly looked for for professional help and because ""missed opportunities"" she decided to kill herself. It is hard to imagine someone would be refused this kind of help after so many referrals.

On the bright side, with advancing computer and health sciences, the future does have some light at the end of the tunnel. I think it's probably helpful to try to focus a bit on the positive.  My political views are different from most.  I find myself disagreeing with many Republican and Democrat stances.  I'm in favor of universal healthcare, basic income, and access to assisted suicide (rational suicide, access to drugs like Nembutal for anyone who thinks they might want to make the rational decision not to live, and instead die in a humane way).	sadness	1	3	1	30	8700	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	115	148	0.10256410256410256	0.10256410256410256	0.05128205128205128	0.1282051282051282	0.0	0.1794871794871795	0.1794871794871795	0.15384615384615385	0.02564102564102564	0.07692307692307693	0.04	2.89940178359551	2.7352590405407495	low	low	An essay about the article 74, written by a 30 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700$.

A lot of Christians in Mosul were ordered to convert away from their beliefs or suffer heavy consequences. This is not a choice most people want to make, let alone be forced to flee their homes. Churches, homes, and streets were not safe. Many people have considered fleeing over returning. However, the human spirit is strong. We all face adversity.

It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern. I am really worried about the outcome for these bears. It is sad to think they may become extinct.	sadness	2	2	1	60	74000	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	154	152	0.17391304347826086	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.34782608695652173	0.21739130434782608	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.961500515152275	2.8343835572916056	medium	medium	An essay about the article 49, written by a 60 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 74000$.

This is tearing my heart out and I can't get the images of what must have happened out of my mind.  You know that I was in the military myself and it makes it that much harder on me.  I can't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel.  From what I read, apparently this was an accident and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the base.  The base was already on alert due to a previous car bomb attack.  I'm guessing that they felt they couldn't take any chances on it being another car bomber and went ahead and shot at the vehicle.  It's so sad.  It's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the enemy, but when they get taken down by friendly fire?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	153	164	0.23809523809523808	0.14285714285714285	0.023809523809523808	0.07142857142857142	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.16666666666666666	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.023809523809523808	0.041666666666666664	2.823035210555863	2.75481605525656	medium	medium	An essay about the article 18, written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.

It's very sad, and it does indeed rob us of talent. All you have to do is look around to see how America is still a man-run country. The number of women in power is small, and women feel conflicted between what society says they should do and what they want to do. After all, many have aspirations besides raising kids. Who says that the 'house-mom' idea is right? The gender gap needs to close, and the wage gap. Women are not paid as much as men.

As well, those in favor of it is also right, and just to want and seek and work towards ways that would be in the best interest of our lives and our environment. I believe it they would not show any interest, then whatever the harmful effects would only increase. Those in opposition, who feel that it's just an umbrella word to funnel monies in areas that are not needed.

Fortunately this one apparently didn't cause any damage, but it was no slouch either at a magnitude 6.4.  Had the earthquake struck in a little different location, who know what might have happened.  This is the same place that got hit with an 8.8 a couple years ago.  Remember that one?  That was so sad.  It triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed.  Not to mention the fact that there were 220,000 homes lost.  One piece of good news at least, since the 8.8 earthquake, they have put in a warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis.  Thank God for that.  That certainly can't prevent any earthquakes from happening, but at least maybe it will save some lives if, or should I say ""when"", the next earthquake occurs."	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	140	178	0.14634146341463414	0.14634146341463414	0.024390243902439025	0.0975609756097561	0.12195121951219512	0.04878048780487805	0.1951219512195122	0.14634146341463414	0.024390243902439025	0.04878048780487805	0.045454545454545456	2.6013133749378414	2.3794179427253197	low	low	An essay about the article 298, written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.

The recent spate of mass shootings at schools and other locations underline the presence of disturbed people in our midst. Besides defending ourselves, we need to ask ourselves what in our society is provoking this disturbing behavior. Certainly the ubiquity and ease of acquiring guns is one cause, but there may be others that need attention as well.	sadness	1	4	1	64	27000	6.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.143	1.714	4.714	4.571000000000001	86	192	0.0	0.08695652173913043	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.34782608695652173	0.08695652173913043	0.043478260869565216	0.043478260869565216	0.08695652173913043	0.1111111111111111	3.0953340775437375	3.062219573838766	medium	low	An essay about the article 310, written by a 64 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 27000$.

When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.  Nothing different is happening in the Middle East.  We always hear that might makes right but that's not truly the case.  Might makes blight and generations suffer till most of it is forgotten.

Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that.

It is so sad that these young people have to take their life because they think there is no end in sight. What we need to do along with providing therapy for those that are bullied is to increase the consequences for those who are bullying others.

What makes this one worse than the usual is that there were chances that she could have been helped but she was turned away. They said that she was ""over the worst of it"" but other evidence suggests that she was not. To me it seems like people did not want to deal with her for some reason or they were on a small budget and could not afford to treat her so they turned her away. Very sad and very messed up that you turn away someone whop wants helpa dn they then kill themselves.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	154	225	0.10638297872340426	0.19148936170212766	0.02127659574468085	0.0851063829787234	0.02127659574468085	0.10638297872340426	0.23404255319148937	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.02127659574468085	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay about the article 128, written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

From the shooter, to the local government, these actions should be condemned on all fronts.

Sad to see that our world is slowly spiraling into this chaos that just continues to grow.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	105	238	0.16666666666666666	0.13333333333333333	0.1	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.058823529411764705	2.9103231209551965	2.8533516766684217	low	low	An essay about the article 344, written by a 24 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000$.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2	6	1	26	49000	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	140	255	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay about the article 169, written by a 26 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000$.

It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.	sadness	2	6	5	33	51000	6.0	5.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	3.571	3.429	145	270	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.16666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.041666666666666664	2.883141101795506	2.6395763754432755	medium	medium	An essay about the article 54, written by a 33 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 51000$.

It is such a sad thing that these elephants can't be protected by all nations. I think we should try to do more. Maybe do some research and see if we can help.

There was a Saudi-led coalition that is backed by the US, they had led an attack in Yemen, that had killed around 43 people.  This is sad to hear so much killing in this world.  According to what I read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new leader, I think his name is Abed Rabbo Mansour.  The USA wants to put him in there.  Also they are more people dying from the long conflict, people are starving and also Planes had attacked a funeral place and they had killed people there as well.  All this necessary killing is not good for this word.  This is really, really bad that we need war to solve problems.	sadness	1	5	2	39	49000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.0	5.0	2.4290000000000003	4.2860000000000005	5.0	146	286	0.17073170731707318	0.17073170731707318	0.04878048780487805	0.07317073170731707	0.024390243902439025	0.0975609756097561	0.1951219512195122	0.14634146341463414	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.045454545454545456	2.873117046582314	2.7557930866304012	medium	medium	An essay about the article 45, written by a 39 years old hispanic or latino male, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 49000$.

This is an area which has hopes of dramatic infrastructure improvement and new jobs.  Many people and organizations have invested a lot of money and now have to wonder whether they should continue to invest in an area which may be destroyed by rioters.  It's so sad to hear about these beautiful farms and nurseries just being gutted and destroyed.  The farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do.  The farms are gone.  It sounded as if some of the elders in the community tried to calm things down, and it worked in some areas, but other areas just raged on with riots and destruction.  Can't these people see that they are ruining their own future?	sadness	1	2	1	54	25000	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	6.5	3.857	2.0	3.714	4.857	142	287	0.09375	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0.03125	0.21875	0.125	0.09375	0.03125	0.09375	0.0	2.93826874122984	2.7491767324843663	medium	low	An essay about the article 170, written by a 54 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 25000$.

It affects genes and ranges in species. More than eighty percent of ecosystems are being put under stress. It makes me sad because we don't know the long-standing implications in the largest perspective.

Clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so unbearable that they are willing to risk their own and their families' lives to try for a different life in another country, with no guarantee that life there would be an improvement.  Its difficult to understand.  Life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance, which I suppose is something difficult for the typical American to picture.  I'm glad that we live in a country where there are relative freedoms and the individual and his or her family can live independently and get their needs met and wants.

Maybe the effects won't be felt as much in our generation but I am sure that the effects will be felt by those others after us sadly.	sadness	2	6	5	24	22000	4.5	5.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	2.714	4.428999999999999	3.286	4.143	151	317	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.05405405405405406	0.2702702702702703	0.0	0.21621621621621623	0.16216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.0	2.8851050612555498	2.8665030936928537	low	low	An essay about the article 20, written by a 24 years old asian/pacific islander female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 22000$.

That is so horrible I really feel bad for them. The say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor. Unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in stable condition so that is good news. Apparently two people outside of the apartment were also hurt by the fire some how. I think they were able to get the fire under control pretty easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes. They had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the fire in the first place.

I do not know why the United States of America will not be more proactive in helping this less fortunate country. A lot of people complain about Chavez, but that seems to be when the country was the most stable.	sadness	2	6	6	37	50000	5.5	7.0	4.5	6.0	7.0	3.143	2.143	2.857	3.714	57	367	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.4207272305827336	2.285586919100131	low	low	An essay about the article 154, written by a 37 years old female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

It sounds as if his son could have been more disturbed than originally thought at the other arrest.  I would be devastated if I felt so threatened by my own child that I had to resort to violence.  I mean, how terrible it must be!  Though details aren't completely clear, it sounds as if the son had some issues that weren't completely dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad.  How terrible to have to carry this with him the rest of forever.  It would break my heart in two.  I hope he gets deep counseling for his grief and guilt.  Perhaps if the son had, it wouldn't have happened.

Initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and attention this situation is creating. I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention. I feel for the little froggies though and hope science can find a way to preserve them and their habitat.	sadness	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	118	401	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.22727272727272727	0.13636363636363635	0.13636363636363635	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.041666666666666664	3.0733373234461627	2.8491270178866577	low	low	An essay about the article 139, written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

I guess that several years ago, the government came up with this program to get internet and technology in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet. However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do.

Hopefully they can recover and go back to where they came from.	sadness	1	6	5	28	45000	5.5	5.0	2.0	6.5	6.0	4.2860000000000005	1.429	2.857	3.857	61	413	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.1	2.92664032803255	2.799986448941813	medium	medium	An essay about the article 167, written by a 28 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 45000$.

Normally an article like this might not attract my attention and cause me to read any further, but this particular forest land is home to the 3rd largest population of endangered orangutans and if the forest is cut down, it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will die or have to be rescued and re-homed. This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong. How can the government in Indonesia think that this idea is even a possibility, never mind the fact it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the negative impact it has on this species!!	sadness	2	5	1	28	62000	7.0	5.5	5.5	6.5	5.5	4.0	2.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	142	418	0.14814814814814814	0.037037037037037035	0.07407407407407407	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037035	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.07407407407407407	0.037037037037037035	0.037037037037037035	0.0	3.069056603956622	3.014447902048003	medium	low	An essay about the article 31, written by a 28 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 62000$.

This is such an unfortunate event. The cause was due to bad building construction as the developers have cowardly gone into hiding.

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience.

It doesn't surprise me when most Millenials out there feel entitled to everything. People don't think for themselves anymore or work hard for what they want. Not that people lack the intelligence but that they don't use it. They go to college, which is hard work, but then they expect a job to be handed to them. The real world isn't after high school, its after college.	sadness	2	6	1	33	75000	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	81	462	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.6101860366068306	2.4201930992088716	medium	low	An essay about the article 55, written by a 33 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000$.

It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it.

However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there. While some strive to save this or that, there are a million other things destroying it further. We need to end the destruction of our global ecosystem, and not pick and choose species to save. Other wise there will be nothing left, and those efforts would have been in vein.	sadness	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	108	512	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.2727272727272727	0.22727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.891064550617793	2.8322232615689216	medium	low	An essay about the article 109, written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns.

It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2	7	1	52	50000	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	141	522	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay about the article 50, written by a 52 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000$.

The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.	neutral	2	6	1	58	40000	6.5	5.5	4.5	6.5	5.5	3.857	2.571	3.0	4.0	101	527	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.2727272727272727	0.09090909090909091	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	2.8951016143521615	2.5406413421720173	medium	low	An essay about the article 360, written by a 58 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.

These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal. By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.	neutral	1	4	5	27	45000	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	108	578	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	2.861190685362936	2.84778427910004	low	low	An essay about the article 366, written by a 27 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000$.

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1	4	3	30	60000	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	124	598	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.23076923076923078	0.038461538461538464	0.23076923076923078	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.15384615384615385	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.6598670138461746	medium	medium	An essay about the article 361, written by a 30 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000$.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement.

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1	6	3	30	40000	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	87	635	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay about the article 152, written by a 30 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000$.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns.

No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear.

It was gruesome to hear one man's account of the story.  He said the shootings went on for 3 hours, and when stopped, it was only so they could load more ammunition and fire more.  I couldn't help but think about the people out in the crowd who where hit and killed.  It's disturbing just imagining that scene and the terror.  And then one man, George Salines, got a call no one would want.  That his daughter was among the 130 killed.  The loss has affected his whole life, he left his job and everything.  In one moment, anyone can be affected by severe tragedy.	fear	5	7	3	34	100000	5.5	4.0	6.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	1.857	2.857	4.143	127	745	0.19230769230769232	0.11538461538461539	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.2692307692307692	0.11538461538461539	0.07692307692307693	0.038461538461538464	0.0	2.745120334409751	2.8173400335941516	low	medium	An essay about the article 247, written by a 34 years old black or african american female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 100000$.

There is extensive looting in Haiti and the situation is extremely dangerous even for those that try to bring in supplies to the people living there.   My heart is breaking as I think of all the people, children and adults in Haiti.  It is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before.

The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice.

I am glad that he didn't lose a leg or anything, but still, that would have been very scary.  All of the sudden, boom, you are hit by a shark.  I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.  I don't think it is really our place to force sharks away, as they live in the water.  I think people just need to be smart and surf where there is a very low chance of being attacked by a shark.	fear	2	6	1	34	6000	7.0	3.0	1.0	7.0	3.5	3.143	4.2860000000000005	4.0	5.0	121	760	0.12903225806451613	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.06451612903225806	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.22580645161290322	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.17647058823529413	2.6358070123827044	2.647115545367129	low	low	An essay about the article 290, written by a 34 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 6000$.

The part of this article that really got to me was that the Muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely.  It would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions.  It would be awful to have the prices of food go up because of blockades and other reasons.  It would be stressful and scary.	fear	2	6	1	34	6000	7.0	3.0	1.0	7.0	3.5	3.143	4.2860000000000005	4.0	5.0	87	791	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.18181818181818182	0.18181818181818182	0.13636363636363635	0.045454545454545456	0.0	2.748012926016522	2.7368525342602377	low	low	An essay about the article 80, written by a 34 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 6000$.

This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.This equally large amount of  aquatic.	fear	1	4	3	32	50000	3.5	3.5	5.0	3.5	3.5	3.143	3.143	3.286	2.857	141	843	0.16216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.10810810810810811	0.08108108108108109	0.2972972972972973	0.13513513513513514	0.10810810810810811	0.0	0.0	2.8811144346996973	2.706010688031269	medium	medium	An essay about the article 248, written by a 32 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 50000$.

That like dengue and West Nile virus, this mosquito-spread disease is now going to be a regular fixture — and a perennial risk for pregnant women. The huge bloom of Zika activity in the Americas right now is unprecedented. A longtime US Army scientist who is now semiretired, Halstead believes Zika will vanish in a few years, likely for decades. That’s the way another arbovirus, chikungunya works, he wrote in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases last year. “The rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we’re heading, within a year or two, to achieve sufficient herd immunity for this virus to die out,	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	117	844	0.10344827586206896	0.034482758620689655	0.10344827586206896	0.13793103448275862	0.06896551724137931	0.1724137931034483	0.20689655172413793	0.06896551724137931	0.034482758620689655	0.06896551724137931	0.045454545454545456	2.396457733118806	2.313047502507231	low	low	An essay about the article 173, written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop.

The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base. Dunford told the committee that investigators had assessed the liquid and found “it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent.” The news is concerning because this is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S.   officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use. No soldiers were injured in the attack, nor have any shown symptoms of exposure to mustard gas, a weapon banned by the 1925 Geneva protocol after the horrors of World War I.	fear	1	7	1	32	70000	1.5	6.5	4.5	1.5	6.5	3.714	2.143	2.4290000000000003	3.429	133	863	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.0	0.16129032258064516	0.1935483870967742	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.0	2.5830610977946926	2.6428388180847384	low	low	An essay about the article 29, written by a 32 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 70000$.

It's even more horrifying to find out the animals that are attacking you are the ones you think are so cute and adorable. I just read an article about squirrels attacking a retirement home and injuring three elderly. It must have been so terrifying for them to encounter this event. Imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters! It's so shocking and I'm still shaking after reading this. They had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out. This is tragic. The bites from the attack could lead to rabies and other diseases.

I guess I'm on the fence about what they're doing to protect the sharks.	fear	2	6	1	56	119000	6.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	3.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	74	874	0.12903225806451613	0.0967741935483871	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.16129032258064516	0.22580645161290322	0.06451612903225806	0.0	0.0967741935483871	0.15384615384615385	2.7343735602102326	2.6176445357145077	medium	low	An essay about the article 290, written by a 56 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 119000$.

Could you imagine? The pettiness inside me kind of smirks at the growing population of them. There is nothing to blame for the existing and gaining population of goldfish, except for ourselves. I mean their very existence is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too. Then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items. So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish! Live your best lives!'	fear	2	6	3	28	35000	4.5	7.0	4.0	6.5	5.5	4.571000000000001	3.0	5.0	3.571	121	875	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.35294117647058826	0.17647058823529413	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.11764705882352941	0.058823529411764705	2.797383452644806	2.712681777720056	low	medium	An essay about the article 162, written by a 28 years old black or african american female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000$.

He was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal government which would have angered the Russian government so I bet they killed him off so that they could avoid him giving away information to the federal government.	fear	1	6	1	28	100000	3.0	3.0	2.0	4.5	4.5	2.714	4.0	3.143	1.857	103	890	0.25806451612903225	0.06451612903225806	0.06451612903225806	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.16129032258064516	0.22580645161290322	0.03225806451612903	0.03225806451612903	0.06451612903225806	0.04	2.660010450956814	2.6312349582327843	low	low	An essay about the article 103, written by a 28 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 100000$.

Prisons are about rehabilitation or at least they should be, but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very distressing and disturbing situations I can't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons.

Shows are cancelled all the time, so I get kind of annoyed with this kind of news.	anger	2	7	1	55	10000	6.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	6.0	3.571	2.0	3.571	4.143	75	923	0.05	0.05	0.1	0.2	0.05	0.2	0.1	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.0	2.7194280888162163	2.5984182552643174	low	low	An essay about the article 393, written by a 55 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 10000$.

Starting with everything he did as President, but then get rid of all his buildings and everything else with his name on it. Maybe when he pays for his crimes he will have to sell all those buildings off. It would be great to get a full accounting of everything he actually owns so that he can repay everyone he has ever ripped off over his lifetime of scamming people. The name ""Trump"" should forever be associated with crime, grifting, treason, lying, cheating and just generally being a piece of human garbage.

Authorities think it was a robbery but the church is convinced it was due to him being a human rights activist.  It sucks that it happened but in all fairness Mexico is a shit hole and well known for cartel actions such as this.  How many of your peers have to get abducted and killed or tortured before you learn to shut the fuck up or get the fuck out?

But this article demonstrates how we can't take anything for granted. I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again?

This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population.

The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	134	1016	0.06976744186046512	0.023255813953488372	0.06976744186046512	0.16279069767441862	0.023255813953488372	0.32558139534883723	0.13953488372093023	0.09302325581395349	0.0	0.09302325581395349	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay about the article 338, written by a 61 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000$.

After that maybe we can plan to picket or have a demonstration at the capitol building voicing our concerns. Do you feel the same about this that I do? if you dont I will get someone else to help me or I will go it alone.  I just feel so strongly that something productive needs to be done and fast.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1	2	1	31	16000	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	136	1083	0.13333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.06666666666666667	0.06666666666666667	0.044444444444444446	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.08888888888888889	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.09090909090909091	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay about the article 342, written by a 31 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000$.

He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks.

He has a tendency to act like a child, but that would be a far stretch, even for him.	anger	2	6	1	32	30000	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	114	1113	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.0	0.08695652173913043	0.17391304347826086	0.17391304347826086	0.13043478260869565	0.043478260869565216	0.0	2.370291908134794	2.4605822732488725	low	low	An essay about the article 326, written by a 32 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000$.

It will happen forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out. The issue is not opposition so much as it is the ability to organize against someone anymore. Using the internet, it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to combat against something vile or unwarranted. The problem is Trump wasn't even given a chance. Now that things have played out, perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely unfair to subject any president of our country to this before they have even been given the chance to lead.	anger	1	6	1	38	24500	6.0	5.5	3.0	5.0	6.5	4.571000000000001	1.714	2.857	4.857	128	1119	0.1	0.13333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.06666666666666667	0.2	0.23333333333333334	0.1	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.043478260869565216	2.7980574821081503	2.757310694246152	low	low	An essay about the article 248, written by a 38 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 24500$.

People are dying, and they need somewhere safe, and all we do is take ten thousand. And let's face it America's hands aren't clean in the middle east, or Africa. America has learned nothing from past wars. We should be providing help to get people out and a safe place for them to stay, but instead we just let them die, getting bombed in their cities and drowned at sea. So I'm angry about this. What kind of society have we become when we let this happen? America should be doing so much more, to help these people. It's callous to think ten thousand is somehow being responsible,  being moral.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

But yeah, that's the gun's fault. i don't own a gun, but I'd be damned if I gave one up to those liberal fascists.	disgust	1	4	1	47	14000	6.5	4.5	1.0	5.5	7.0	3.143	1.143	3.0	3.429	72	1176	0.16666666666666666	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.3333333333333333	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.05555555555555555	0.0	2.605583368544296	2.4971458897317436	low	low	An essay about the article 50, written by a 47 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 14000$.

Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1	4	1	34	55000	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	91	1177	0.1951219512195122	0.21951219512195122	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.04878048780487805	0.024390243902439025	0.2682926829268293	0.07317073170731707	0.07317073170731707	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay about the article 378, written by a 34 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000$.

And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct.

I'm not a Trump fan, but mark my words, this kind of crap will be the reason why he wins in 2020.	disgust	2	2	2	34	65000	6.0	6.0	3.5	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.714	4.0	4.0	64	1224	0.043478260869565216	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.0	0.21739130434782608	0.21739130434782608	0.043478260869565216	0.13043478260869565	0.08695652173913043	0.0	2.481230778757426	2.469761864406048	low	low	An essay about the article 241, written by a 34 years old hispanic or latino female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 65000$.

The governments and terrorist organizations like Boko Haram don't care about kids. I gotta think this is just another example of pure evil, killing kids all the while the government takes aid, money, food, or whatever and keeps it for themselves or sells it to the people and puts them in servitude.

I get that there has always been murder, and if someone is determined enough they are going to find a way to do this, but for it to happen in one of the most locked down and secured places is ridiculous.

Where are the parents when the kids are out there fighting and attacking people in the street. Its just disgusting. I'm just happy that their victim wasn't badly hurt, but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again. I think their parents should be held liable if their kids don't stop acting this way because it is obviously the fault of the parents for failing to take control of their kids.	disgust	1	6	1	25	50000	4.0	5.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	2.857	2.143	3.714	3.571	97	1243	0.16666666666666666	0.19444444444444445	0.05555555555555555	0.027777777777777776	0.027777777777777776	0.027777777777777776	0.25	0.16666666666666666	0.05555555555555555	0.027777777777777776	0.06666666666666667	2.675902463281709	2.7094333948955835	low	medium	An essay about the article 155, written by a 25 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000$.

Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits.

In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?

It's a travesty that such violence is being committed, such life changing violence. These people are not dying, they're being irreparibly harmed, altered, changed for the rest of their lives. More people should be talking about the use of such ""non-lethal"" weapons. Can't the local force exercise some restraint, some humanity? It's confusing, because I can't think of any reason other than harm someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the case here."	surprise	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857	115	1389	0.16279069767441862	0.13953488372093023	0.0	0.06976744186046512	0.0	0.11627906976744186	0.23255813953488372	0.16279069767441862	0.09302325581395349	0.023255813953488372	0.0	2.6794974527734756	2.698839484602791	low	low	An essay about the article 163, written by a 34 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 48000$.

These people have broken the law and are here illegally yet they expect to be treated just like US citizens.  DACA is a slap in the face to those immigrants who followed the law and went through the process to become legal citizens.

I am so happy that researchers are working towards making it more tolerable so that more people will undergo the procedure that can save their lives. I am happy that many different options are available: not all involving colon cleansing (e.g. X-rays), that there is a dietary advice to minimize the discomfort (which food to eat before the procedure), etc. So, the person’s quality of life, their well-being in the short term is taken seriously into account.	joy	2	7	1	45	120000	6.0	5.5	2.5	5.5	6.0	4.0	3.857	3.714	4.0	91	1441	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.1875	0.0	0.3125	0.09375	0.0625	0.03125	0.125	0.1	2.9894988919189727	2.864918305833841	low	low	An essay about the article 263, written by a 45 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 120000$.

I usually suck at reciprocating, so I took this as an opportunity to tell her what she meant to me.

Sports have been men's things for so long and I am happy to see that there are women joining the ranks of these top athletes. I am so proud of my species and how we have come so far in equality. I love that there are more even playing grounds now.	joy	2	4	3	34	30000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	80	1456	0.0	0.0	0.24	0.2	0.04	0.24	0.0	0.04	0.04	0.2	0.3076923076923077	2.766631234719572	2.7334006408967904	low	low	An essay about the article 16, written by a 34 years old black or african american female, went to college, with an income of 30000$.

Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1	7	2	30	60000	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	116	1471	0.06666666666666667	0.08888888888888889	0.08888888888888889	0.06666666666666667	0.044444444444444446	0.2222222222222222	0.13333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.15555555555555556	0.05	2.7570415470565877	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay about the article 196, written by a 30 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000$.

I think that's a nice and respectful way to honor his legacy.	joy	2	6	1	34	39000	6.5	6.0	7.0	6.5	7.0	4.0	3.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	57	1472	0.0625	0.0	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.3125	0.0	0.0	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.593898305592852	2.388875318106665	low	low	An essay about the article 164, written by a 34 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 39000$.

I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results.
