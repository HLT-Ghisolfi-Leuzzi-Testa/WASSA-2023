2.167	5.5	Read this article, this happened in Georgia where I live so I saw massive amounts of news coverage related to this case. I personally believe that the guy is guilty, there are too many things that he did and said that did not add up.It seems that he wanted to get rid of his kid and leave his wife and live his free lifestyle. I do not see any possible way that he did not know that the kid was in the car. That poor kid!	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	47.0	79000.0	6.5	4.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	2.286	4.428999999999999	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	86	94	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.3	0.3	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6980460245635256	2.666816827876811	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 79000.0$.

There's been no apology, only a doubling down on the kind of bile, arrogance, and ignorance that was on display since day one.

1.833	1.0	I pretty much hate all wildlife including squirrels. They should  just go blast the little varmint. After all squirrels carry rabies and other diseases even if they say small animals seldom have rabies. Once you bite a human, it's over and you deserve to die. It is kind of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away. Why does everything wacky always happen in Florida. Like 30% of anything strange happens in Florida. Frankly I think some reporter made the whole thing up. Squirrels are not going to attack multiple people. Sure they might on a rare occasion bite someone but not three people. Then again it's Florida so common laws and logic go out the window. ANyhow thought you might enjoy some rambling on some things I read. Take care buddy.

Since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal, they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation. Emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

Apparently, there were no problems with the barrier. I'd like to know how the little boy got in there. Based on what I read, I don't really take issue with the zoo or the gorilla. The barrier was at the right standard, and the gorilla did what a gorilla is going to do if something like that happens. I place the blame on the parents who somehow let their 3 year old child climb into a gorilla enclosure.

5.667000000000001	5.125	This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	95	86	0.1063829787234042	0.1276595744680851	0.0638297872340425	0.1489361702127659	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.1702127659574468	0.0638297872340425	0.1063829787234042	0.0425531914893617	0.0909090909090909	2.9422282048245303	3.000730637576451	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	7.0	5.0	1.143	3.571	4.714	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	105	85	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.2272727272727272	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0526315789473684	3.168803304379618	2.9649278441356337	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Trump directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted degrading messages -- particularly in schools.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks.

He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits.

Seems a bit high but I guess people just have no respect for nature or other peoples lives. Having your house burn down in a wild fire has to be one of the worst things that coudl happen to someone. All your belongings, all those memories, the life you built and the family or friends you surroudned yourself with. Gone. Well hopefully not your family gone cause then you'd really be in trouble but your hosue at least and sentimental things.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, ""I just wish I could go to sleep forever.""  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.

That's right, I just read this article detailing the struggles currently going on with coffee crop farmers. There is an intense struggle at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going. The warm temperatures have really threw a wrench into their day to day operations and maintaining the coffee crops has become quite a challenge. We are in danger of either paying really high prices on coffee or worse case scenario being without coffee period. This is very distressing for me.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

While the reef is mostly destroyed, it has sections that are coming back to life, and it can be stimulated back to recovery despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death stroke. Did you know it can be seen from outer space? How magnificent! We should do what we can to preserve it, even if it is a losing cause because it is a true wonder of nature. I know that contradicts what I told you earlier about not trying to save species, but hey, whoever said consistency was my greatest attribute?	surprise	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	106	373	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0606060606060606	0.1818181818181818	0.1212121212121212	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.828964520678369	2.65048712315917	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

While Trump wasn't my ideal President, he was the much better choice over Clinton. So, in my opinion, he was the better candidate. I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion. So, I can't say that I really think Moore and I are on the same page, and we have a difference of opinions.	anger	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	102	97	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.5	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0833333333333333	2.293436679116631	2.113060516619183	low	low	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?   I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.

I did not get too many details about all of the evidence that they have against her but to me at least it does not seem like they have that much evidence. I guess she ordered her friend a coffee before her friend got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died. Pretty crazy, right? I think she probably did it but their motive is weak and I do not think that she would have been found guilty if the trial was going on in the US.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	124	620	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.1818181818181818	0.1515151515151515	0.1212121212121212	0.0	0.1515151515151515	0.0	2.797317659848697	2.7629927272499057	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

6.167000000000001	5.125	I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway.

Perhaps it got caught inside and out of fear did what animals do - bite and claw their way out. I'm assuming it was the latter reason and this just happened to be an odd situation. I don't think it meant to hurt anyone, I think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way. I can't imagine another reason than that.

It's crazy to think that if the officers never confronted him for something unrelated, that there could have been countless more killings.	surprise	1.0	6.0	5.0	25.0	70000.0	5.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.857	2.143	4.0	3.714	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	54	498	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.7093261450465045	2.922420311263904	low	low	An essay written by a 25.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

They were riding on the back of a trailer when they got hit by another car. That is so unsafe.

Imagine if you could go back home and go to sleep at halftime of the Super Bowl and then come back the next day and play the second half. Maybe then the Falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the Patriots more seriously. When I watched Lebron crush the Raptors I was kind of curious as to how they slept knowing a game was coming up.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry.

It's unbelievable that an entire generation of culture will be separated from their families and can only take what they have learned so far.	surprise	1.0	4.0	1.0	30.0	50000.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	3.286	2.4290000000000003	2.714	3.714	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	79	1088	0.0625	0.25	0.0	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.375	0.0	0.0625	0.0	0.0	2.9485138662756816	2.821306332851064	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

It sounds like a severe case of pneumonia, but from what, how and why.  And the fluid on the brain of the one sister is so strange.  I would think they would know more after the autopsies, and I don't understand why that is taking so long.  I'm thinking that the family wants to bring the bodies back to the States and that could be holding up the autopsies.	surprise	2.0	6.0	1.0	58.0	60000.0	6.5	5.5	5.5	5.0	5.5	2.857	2.0	1.714	2.4290000000000003	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	105	493	0.3333333333333333	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.786801374507373	2.64032793888475	low	low	An essay written by a 58.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

To think that every day people are drinking water with as much lead as indicated is a bit disturbing - and it's not going to be cheap to fix.	fear	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	75000.0	5.5	4.0	3.0	5.5	4.0	4.0	2.714	2.714	3.714	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	81	166	0.0	0.1	0.0	0.0	0.1	0.3	0.3	0.1	0.1	0.0	0.0	2.959910954746383	2.762289706513695	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

3.5	5.5	This is a very heartbreaking article. It's hard to read what is happening to people in other parts of the world. I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas. I can understand why some would not want to travel and live there, considering there is a high probability of death from an airstrike but the people should at least have basic food items, clothing 	hope/sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	35.0	148000.0	6.5	2.5	1.0	4.5	4.0	4.571	2.0	1.857	4.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	143	1590	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0789473684210526	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.1578947368421052	0.0789473684210526	0.0263157894736842	0.0789473684210526	0.0416666666666666	2.940207057128023	2.766534416358188	medium	medium	An essay written by a 35.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 148000.0$.

Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

And for those who are not dead, we should think about them, provide them with better guide, counseling and stuff like that, they go through traumatic events at work	surprise	1.0	2.0	1.0	26.0	55000.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	4.571000000000001	1.571	4.571000000000001	5.0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	90	1056	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0909090909090909	0.2272727272727272	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0666666666666666	2.847882578060009	2.805960071535521	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 55000.0$.

I wonder if he died right away or if he suffered a lot before dying. Rangers tried to recover the mans body after the mans sister called and reported the accident. They believe that the extreme heat and the acidic liquid completely disolved the body and there was nothing left.

I would like to change the way the world behave but this would be a big undertaking and I think it may be too big. There are small and big things that we can do with our daily meals and meal planning that can help with this problem of food waste but I think it will take more time and money to implement it. And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste. If it gets us less than 1% more efficiency in how we use food, than it may not be worth the effort, and we may need to look at other ideas. Combating food waste could also lead to an increase it food poisoning since questionable foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a precaution.	surprise	1.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	6.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.429	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	155	1072	0.0357142857142857	0.0178571428571428	0.1071428571428571	0.1428571428571428	0.0178571428571428	0.25	0.1607142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.125	0.0	3.012018933955341	2.864087843745476	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	surprise	1.0	3.0	1.0	33.0	58000.0	6.0	5.0	2.5	7.0	7.0	3.143	2.4290000000000003	3.0	3.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	144	619	0.0377358490566037	0.0943396226415094	0.1509433962264151	0.2075471698113207	0.0943396226415094	0.1698113207547169	0.0566037735849056	0.0566037735849056	0.0	0.1320754716981132	0.064516129032258	2.792340660188893	2.805059578551726	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 58000.0$.

There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	fear	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	87	31	0.2857142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.0	2.9046020323054087	2.814765039802998	medium	medium	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.
