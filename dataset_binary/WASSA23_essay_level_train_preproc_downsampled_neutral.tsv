6.0	6.0	This article really hits home for me as my father was a smoker. I am so grateful he choose to smoke outside and never around us kids. I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	131	2017	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.2333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.0434782608695652	2.940353679531366	2.7247461163058446	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.5	5.625	This article says that, A deeper look inside Wells Fargo's shameful vault — People my kids' age, who track their money by smartphone, wonder why garish competing bank branches still stud every shopping district in Philadelphia and the suburbs. Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	23.0	65000.0	5.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	3.429	3.429	3.857	3.429	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	124	215	0.0512820512820512	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1794871794871795	0.0769230769230769	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0256410256410256	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.0416666666666666	2.4151312201929303	2.583982302011855	low	medium	An essay written by a 23.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 65000.0$.

Having come across an article detailing the latest events in Germany, a country that was once known for welcoming immigrants, it is disheartening to see the current toughened approach.

You think of the people that are doing this and put yourself in there shoes but also the countries who get these transplants and have to deal with them. Every human deserves a life free from harm and these lands really arent anyones but i can see having undocumented people invade your country is a bad thing that is why there is systems in place to keep track of people. I think more should be done to help these countries so people do not want to flee we need to build there government and police up so they are equipped to fight terrorist groups and rebels who push there citizens out.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	121	2020	0.2162162162162162	0.1081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.054054054054054	0.081081081081081	0.081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1081081081081081	0.054054054054054	0.027027027027027	0.04	3.044229263630461	2.943677601818864	medium	medium	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	49.0	15000.0	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	146	526	0.1351351351351351	0.081081081081081	0.1081081081081081	0.027027027027027	0.054054054054054	0.1081081081081081	0.2162162162162162	0.1621621621621621	0.0	0.1081081081081081	0.0	2.6187031981155022	2.5647800652986943	low	low	An essay written by a 49.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 15000.0$.

They warned that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming today’s deciduous forests into barren lands hostile for plants and animals, and of course including humans. Last year, hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non-binding agreement. Known as the Paris Agreement, its main goal is to stop global warning by implementing and keeping long-term solutions.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

5.332999999999999	5.0	Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	40000.0	4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	3.0	3.429	3.571	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	87	186	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.5	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.0	3.2725992195162674	3.057637277278381	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

Because there is no technical ""war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all.

They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference.

I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.	disgust	1.0	4.0	1.0	34.0	55000.0	7.0	1.5	1.0	4.0	7.0	1.286	1.0	1.0	1.286	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	91	54	0.1951219512195122	0.2195121951219512	0.0	0.0975609756097561	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.0	2.5598898105366144	2.734142719463579	low	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 55000.0$.

There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	joy	1.0	6.0	5.0	36.0	50000.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	4.5	5.0	3.714	2.714	4.2860000000000005	4.143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	98	30	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2631578947368421	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935160266587608	2.799303973765628	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

The footage, shot and posted to Facebook on Wednesday, shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved. “You cannot arrest me until I know I have a warrant,” she tells the officers as she struggles with them. Suddenly, one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist.

They are obviously a dangerous group of kids, who know right from wrong, but for some reason, they don't think the law applies to them.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	106	431	0.1212121212121212	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.1515151515151515	0.0303030303030303	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0714285714285714	2.830480181361589	2.8578349115660653	low	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	130	1978	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0277777777777777	0.1666666666666666	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.2222222222222222	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1666666666666666	0.0	2.83674499737937	2.666083950315939	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I just read about a mother from Fresno Texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock school election for Donald Trump she also videotaped it. Well, of course, the video went viral. The Fort Bend County Texas sheriff's department went to check out the situation and the child seemed to be in good health. The mother made the child stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house. The mother claims now that it was only a joke.

4.5	4.75	“The vast majority of battleground states have Republicans overseeing their election systems,” Moore told POLITICO last week. “It’s safe to assume they’re not rigging the process either against Donald Trump or for anyone else.” Meanwhile, Trump’s downward spiral has forced House Republicans to scramble to secure their once-safe majority and the difficult balancing act between Trump’s die-hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable Senate candidates like New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte. She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat. For the party that put Trump forward, the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more, to use a favorite Trump term, of a “horror show.”	neutral	1.0	4.0	3.0	30.0	60000.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	4.0	3.5	2.571	2.571	3.143	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	304	0.1153846153846153	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0384615384615384	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0384615384615384	0.0384615384615384	0.1538461538461538	0.0	2.7376762877819973	2.659867013846174	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

1.0	7.0	This article I just read is pretty disturbing. It's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a hot spring that fell into one that was way too hot, and was basically boiled alive. It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.	disgust	1.0	2.0	2.0	20.0	80000.0	6.5	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	86	503	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.2142857142857142	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0769230769230769	2.6271367247590587	2.6503267058899542	medium	medium	An essay written by a 20.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 80000.0$.

I believe most police officers are good people, but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many police departments. The protests were certainly justified. Police should be subjected to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism. Those that do need to be removed from active duty immediately.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	30.0	76000.0	5.5	1.5	1.0	6.0	3.5	3.857	3.571	3.571	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	71	674	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1	0.1333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.2	0.1666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0333333333333333	0.0625	3.0866674371720566	3.032050342681197	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 76000.0$.

I feel like it's always on the women to be the ones to hold men accountable and to report it and everything but I'm so frustrated by the fact that men won't take a bigger stand. Men should hold each other accountable for sexual assault and encourage each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the time. I'm just so frustrated by how there are so many stories of women that are suffering needlessly at the hands of these arrogant men and yet women have to endure a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a slap on the wrist, it really just makes me so sick to my stomach, I hate it so much.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	154	456	0.1063829787234042	0.1914893617021276	0.0212765957446808	0.0851063829787234	0.0212765957446808	0.1063829787234042	0.2340425531914893	0.0851063829787234	0.1276595744680851	0.0212765957446808	0.0	2.962898252601903	2.981232598048779	medium	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

I wish people would stop pretending to be concerned over things that they ultimately have almost no influence on, anyway."	anger	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	122	370	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.0512820512820512	0.0256410256410256	0.0	0.1025641025641025	0.282051282051282	0.1282051282051282	0.0512820512820512	0.0512820512820512	0.037037037037037	2.862843402460182	2.8337898914839985	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

I don't know, but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding. I am not sure what will happen in the future, but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint, maybe, just maybe we can make a small impact on the ice melting. I know the Earth goes through cycles, but I am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles. It is as if humans are a parasite. We are like a chronic inflammation to the Earth. It's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe.

It's really troubling to read about just how much damage is being done, and you KNOW that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here. We have a man-child president, and while the majority of the biggest countries are trying to make policy changes to fight global warming, our president is dismantling our E.P.A organization, and putting idiots that don't give two craps about the environment in charge. So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go. Anyways, you should really read this article. I told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed, so go read it.	anger	1.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	40000.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	6.5	7.0	5.0	1.714	3.286	5.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	143	733	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.0	2.9289554973030567	2.763764590920136	medium	medium	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 40000.0$.

There weren't many details in the story about why the shooter did what he did.  Was he targeting someone in particular?  Or did the old guy who died just get unlucky?  I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.  Not that they outright lie.  But they imply and conflate and do all sorts of disingenuous things.

Someone needs to sit down with CEOs and ask them, ""Why do you want billions if you won't be able to enjoy it in the future when the environment is completely fucked?"" Seriously, where is a CEO going to travel to enjoy his millions and stay at luxury resort villas when the environment is completely fucked? The luxury resort will be gone!! His wealth will end up amounting to nothing when he can't even enjoy it. His future children will have millions passed down but they won't fully enjoy it because the planet will be fucked! What the fuck? These people are morally fucking bankrupt, only bankrupt they'll ever know."	anger	2.0	4.0	1.0	26.0	35000.0	7.0	6.0	7.0	7.0	4.0	4.714	2.571	4.0	3.571	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	140	632	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.131578947368421	0.1842105263157894	0.0	0.2894736842105263	0.0789473684210526	0.0526315789473684	0.0263157894736842	0.1842105263157894	0.1481481481481481	2.6076474201593345	2.711750345728115	low	medium	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 35000.0$.

2.1666666666666665	1.25	I suppose this is about an orphaned rhino due to poaching.  I had a hard time really feeling that much for the rhino.  It's dead and I don't know exactly why it died, or what suffering it went through, although the writer suggested it was a lot.  But either way it's dead now so there's no more pain for it.  I guess I'd prefer that rhinos don't go extinct, but at the same time I don't pretend that it really matters.  They don't affect my life in any way, although they are cool creatures.  But it just seems so far away and is something I have no control over.  I would never kill a rhino, but obviously other people don't feel the same way.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	124	1925	0.1428571428571428	0.0571428571428571	0.0857142857142857	0.0571428571428571	0.0571428571428571	0.1142857142857142	0.2	0.1714285714285714	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0588235294117647	2.539101061992444	2.3531190403933007	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

1.0	2.625	I would find it hard to believe that the students are still alive if they were handed over to the drug cartel. If these students were on a trip to hijack vehicles, then law enforcement should not use their time and resources to search for them, especially after 2 years. Their time should be spent on non-criminals.  But if they believe the police are the ones who handed them over to a drug cartel, then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	6.5	7.0	3.0	3.5	2.0	3.714	4.428999999999999	4.857	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	89	1121	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0555555555555555	0.1666666666666666	0.2222222222222222	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.0	2.95893284074278	2.974448426322971	medium	medium	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

A CDC-backed study published in February of this year has found that about a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep.Multiple factors affect the country’s snooze patterns, and one of which is routine. Many people, researchers at the CDC say, are not prioritizing sleep.So how can you force yourself to go early in bed? Well, this new research that we’ll discuss might convince you to review your priorities and put sleep above many, because you still can.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	46.0	240000.0	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	104	207	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.2666666666666666	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0625	2.8744933602605376	2.7533072623212265	medium	medium	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 240000.0$.

The details were sparse, but apparently a man opened fire with an assault rifle in the public space and only killed one elderly man.

So many children died, just because they were born into the ""wrong"" culture. This mentality, unfortunately, isn't isolated or gone from planet.

I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come.

Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here.

I wish they would have caught him sooner and kept him alive so he could explain his actions.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	99	432	0.1176470588235294	0.0588235294117647	0.1176470588235294	0.2352941176470588	0.0	0.2352941176470588	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.817260229278477	2.805333644401416	medium	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

He could have shot into the ground or into the air to scare the dog off.  I feel bad for the lady that lost her dog but this is why you keep your dogs on leashes.  If she hadn't let the dog off the leash this probably would not have happened.  It's a terrible and unfortunate situation all around and I hope I never find myself with the same problem.

The old saying that you ""need money to make money"" is true in the sense that if you show up on our shores with nothing at all, it's going to be awfully hard to make anything of yourself.  That being said, the American dream has always been one of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and being a self-made-man.  You need to be able to do things on your own and most of the most successful people on Earth came from abject poverty."	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	33.0	75000.0	7.0	3.5	2.0	4.5	4.5	3.857	3.0	3.714	3.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	111	1358	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.1935483870967742	0.064516129032258	0.1935483870967742	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1612903225806451	0.0769230769230769	2.708111987283182	2.5642530185125265	low	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

7.0	7.0	The general rule of thumb is that to be healthy individuals need to get a minimum of eight hours of sleep a night. Some people get more, and some people get along well with less, but everyone needs to get enough sleep or else they cannot function effectively in their everyday activities. In their work, Your Guide to a Healthy Sleep, National Institutes of Health pointed out that sleep is very important to human existence, so important that one-third of a person’s life is spent doing it (1). In Sleep, Sleep Disorders, and Biological Rhythms, Amlaner said, “Sleep is a required activity, not an option” (19). During sleep the human body has an opportunity to recuperate from the activities of the day.

I think that it should not be difficult for people to conduct themselves appropriately, so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	107	280	0.1	0.05	0.2	0.15	0.15	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.05	0.05	0.0434782608695652	2.495359342425146	2.493830002598717	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

1.0	1.0	The real problem with people born with critical illness is that we try so hard to give them a normal life. However these people are not normal. And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society. Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct. This instinct should have it's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the rest of us.	disgust	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	138	542	0.1590909090909091	0.0681818181818181	0.0681818181818181	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.2045454545454545	0.1590909090909091	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0714285714285714	2.902474012458097	2.7874074781430678	medium	medium	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

It said that most classrooms are now connected, but the millions of dollars are still being spent. The program seemed to be wasting a lot of money and wasn't showing good results. I agree that just buying computers and being on the Internet doesn't guarantee that kids are receiving a good education.	neutral	2.0	6.0	1.0	39.0	21600.0	3.5	3.5	2.0	5.5	3.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	4.428999999999999	4.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	86	1237	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.2	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1176470588235294	2.6295257813501838	2.487605835112237	low	low	An essay written by a 39.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 21600.0$.

Upon reading an article on the recent developments in Germany, a country that was previously celebrated for its support of immigrants, it becomes apparent that the situation has become more arduous. This fills me with remorse and a deep sense of pain for those who genuinely require a place of refuge, something that Germany was well-known for providing in the past. Hopefully, there will be a reversal of these circumstances.	hope/sadness	1.0	7.0	1.0	46.0	150000.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	3.286	3.857	3.0	2.857	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	90	2202	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.25	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0555555555555555	2.890804998220996	2.5956197897737803	low	low	An essay written by a 46.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 150000.0$.

When he was found he was covered in leaches, weak, and very disoriented. Its a miracle he survived on his own for ten days in the jungle. There was no cell coverage in the part of the jungle he was in so he could not communicate to anyone or ask for help.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	44.0	26000.0	4.0	3.0	1.5	5.5	2.0	1.857	4.857	4.714	2.4290000000000003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	83	1317	0.1818181818181818	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.0666666666666666	2.7219217018705306	2.5603514421534914	low	medium	An essay written by a 44.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 26000.0$.

5.667000000000001	4.75	I feel that these Muslim areas are in dire need of help. I feel so very sad and alarmed for them, as I know the citizens are helpless and don't know who to turn to for help. It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	sadness	2.0	2.0	1.0	40.0	85000.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	3.571	3.429	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	152	95	0.1944444444444444	0.0277777777777777	0.1388888888888889	0.0833333333333333	0.0277777777777777	0.1111111111111111	0.1944444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.0277777777777777	0.0833333333333333	0.0434782608695652	3.1169495034032297	2.9520328213810942	medium	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a high school diploma, with an income of 85000.0$.

6.0	6.0	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	119	1983	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.3157894736842105	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.935863617537285	2.8391645344321152	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness.

For me, it's not so much about being fat or not, it's about reducing pain.	neutral	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	70	1338	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.0256410256410256	0.0512820512820512	0.0	0.1538461538461538	0.2051282051282051	0.1794871794871795	0.1282051282051282	0.0256410256410256	0.0	3.156375725189991	2.835271427712831	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

The leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to guilt you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while majority of this money goes towards these non-profit organizations that help them push thier agenda. These environmental groups are only capable of gutting thier own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as China or any other third world nation that is burning coal. By raising the cost of oil isn't going to stop Saudi Arabia or Russia from pumping oil, its all a racket to control the power supply and tax the people.	neutral	1.0	4.0	5.0	27.0	45000.0	6.0	4.0	4.0	6.0	6.0	3.429	1.571	3.0	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	108	820	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0454545454545454	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.1818181818181818	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.861190685362936	2.84778427910004	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, went to college, with an income of 45000.0$.

Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution.

Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	140	457	0.12	0.08	0.12	0.0	0.0	0.08	0.28	0.24	0.04	0.04	0.0	2.767055027882624	2.6589168550101925	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

Something should not have to affect you in order for it to matter. There are things that are a lot more important than your coffee fix. For instance, the people-like the people in the story-whose livelihoods are being put in danger because of global warming.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	70000.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	5.5	5.5	3.143	2.857	3.714	3.714	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	77	126	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.841397005345242	2.8286421250592	low	medium	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70000.0$.

Expecting anything from your government or your party is pointless unless you have some amount of influence. Politics have not stopped war, poverty, disease, crime, or anything else. It simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no differently than in olden times. They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there. But that is because there is not enough focus on the horrible things happening under our noses, even in our own neighborhoods. People are wretched, and those who rise to power will continue to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor, or support that will keep them in power.	anger	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	136	544	0.1333333333333333	0.1111111111111111	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.0888888888888888	0.1111111111111111	0.0444444444444444	0.0909090909090909	2.8913690194102943	2.819325641745149	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.

I am glad, though I never think about it, how lucky I am to be in a country with some ""sense"" of stability, and not ruled in constant flux."	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	34.0	20000.0	3.5	6.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	4.143	3.857	3.714	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	106	1006	0.1470588235294117	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.2647058823529412	0.1176470588235294	0.088235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0588235294117647	0.0	2.7602045952467336	2.565336049812786	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 20000.0$.

It's a really good drink too. We should share a few Arnold Palmers later on today to honor the life of this great man. Should we hit a few rounds today as well? I mean I know you're a big gold fan, so I understand how this is upsetting you. I will send you more articles about him later on today so we can talk more about him. What do you think? Who do you think was better? Jack or Arnold? What about tiger? Either way, I hope you get this article and it helps lift your spirits a bit. I cannot really connect to the article since I am not a big golf person, but I still think we should honor the man.	surprise	1.0	6.0	2.0	33.0	109000.0	6.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	6.0	5.0	1.0	4.2860000000000005	4.857	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	157	440	0.03125	0.0625	0.125	0.1875	0.09375	0.28125	0.0625	0.03125	0.0	0.125	0.074074074074074	2.720422443657355	2.4350625318441663	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 109000.0$.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.   Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations.    Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

1.8333333333333333	1.375	I don't feel much sympathy at all in this situation.  War is war.  What some professor at Columbia says about how war should be fought is idiotic.  What value are words in war?  Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.

Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.

1.0	6.0	President Donald Trumps actions during his election and so far during the presidency has been nothing short of childish.  I don't think he has any idea of what a filter is, and I don't think he cares what anyone thinks about him.  Him winning the president election was probable one of the worst things that could have happened to our country at this time and moment, but things could be worse.  Like the previous article, we could be comparing President Trump to Hitler, which in my opinion is absolutely terrible.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	30000.0	5.5	5.0	6.0	6.0	5.5	4.143	2.714	3.143	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	90	434	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.1052631578947368	0.0526315789473684	0.0666666666666666	2.44516410624263	2.502142799243855	low	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

2.167	1.125	The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not dead, apparently, after all! While the reef is mostly destroyed, it has sections that are coming back to life, and it can be stimulated back to recovery despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death stroke. Did you know it can be seen from outer space? How magnificent! We should do what we can to preserve it, even if it is a losing cause because it is a true wonder of nature. I know that contradicts what I told you earlier about not trying to save species, but hey, whoever said consistency was my greatest attribute?	surprise	1.0	6.0	2.0	37.0	25000.0	5.0	6.0	4.5	1.5	3.5	1.857	2.0	2.286	1.0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	106	373	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1212121212121212	0.0606060606060606	0.1818181818181818	0.1212121212121212	0.1212121212121212	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0	2.828964520678369	2.65048712315917	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old hispanic or latino male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 25000.0$.

1.3330000000000002	1.0	The whole situation with Iraq and the uprising of ISIS can be attributed to the U.S. War on Terror and failed attempts at establishing democracy in the Middle East. The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	disgust	1.0	6.0	5.0	31.0	75000.0	5.5	2.5	1.0	4.0	3.5	3.714	3.429	1.0	4.0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	115	342	0.1071428571428571	0.2142857142857142	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.1071428571428571	0.25	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0	0.0	2.5363191281723285	2.4679393281939808	low	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 75000.0$.

In the short term though, a way to help would be organizing a blood drive so those victims will get all the blood they need.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	29.0	25000.0	3.0	3.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	2.714	2.0	4.571000000000001	4.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	68	771	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.2857142857142857	0.0	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	3.354419175798062	2.978865985379838	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 25000.0$.

5.332999999999999	1.0	Dear C., I just read an article about gun deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children. Small, isolated cases that happened in small towns. As I was reading the background and history of the families, it occurred to me that there's a strong socioeconomic component present, and that the people described weren't what you and I would call middle-class, and definitely not well-educated. It's like we were talking about the other day, I don't think that the dems can possibly win this fight unless they are able to appeal to gun owners. I don't think that this dynamic is going to change -- I mean, when you think about it, guns symbolize power, and in the article I read, what came across is that the people who used them against children (one child against another) need to feel power.	neutral	2.0	7.0	1.0	52.0	50000.0	7.0	5.5	2.0	7.0	7.0	4.428999999999999	1.571	3.143	4.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	141	916	0.2	0.12	0.12	0.04	0.08	0.12	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.08	0.0	2.869225286783848	2.630750049573305	medium	low	An essay written by a 52.0 years old white female, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

I'm not really into sports, which the article focused on, but the article did talk about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments. It was a little hard to follow because I'm not really familiar with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals. I think people generally care more about men's performances, but it's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too. There was one bit about a woman who got some popularity over what the writer called a ""raunchy"" photo shoot.

I love to understand what part of reality I can dissect to understand how I can do better myself. For example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body I usually take it off. For example I had a bad weave on my head one time and I took it off after church and never wore it again. I love to always look my best and if I don't I will usually correct the situation. The perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they perceive it as reality. I have always received constructive criticism from my parents so that I can also distinguish the difference as well. Parents should often be the critic ok.	joy	2.0	5.0	4.0	26.0	45000.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.5	3.0	3.429	2.857	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	180	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.0	2.729101677085829	2.5667710862958937	medium	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old native american or american indian female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 45000.0$.

This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply. When I contact my superiors that also work remotely, most projects are mishandled in ways and my personalized communication style.""An essay written by a 30 years old white male, with two year associate degree, with an income of 10000$.

There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	sadness	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	26000.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	5.5	6.0	3.429	3.286	3.571	2.286	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	76	258	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0454545454545454	0.1363636363636363	0.0227272727272727	0.1818181818181818	0.1590909090909091	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.0227272727272727	0.0555555555555555	2.8295488007595484	2.826317539259576	medium	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 26000.0$.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.	anger/neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	134	2151	0.1951219512195122	0.1219512195121951	0.024390243902439	0.073170731707317	0.0	0.1707317073170731	0.2682926829268293	0.073170731707317	0.048780487804878	0.024390243902439	0.0	2.4496349853231525	2.358155466509139	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

5.0	3.125	This article presents a viewpoint I strongly agree with. The idea of how places such as zzos and theme parks are filled with impressionable young minds who should not be exposed to smoking had never crossed my mind. I believe that cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is prohibited. When children witness others smoking, they perceive it as normal and acceptable. By shielding this generation from such influences, we can promote healthier choices and a brighter future. Implementing a ban like this holds the potential to significantly reduce the number of new smokers and eradicate the societal appeal of smoking for future generations. I fully support this suggested prohibition and foresee no negative consequences in enforcing it.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	121	2266	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1290322580645161	0.1612903225806451	0.064516129032258	0.2580645161290322	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.032258064516129	0.0	2.459469704803454	2.499544825667995	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

Taxi driver Aguek Nyok helped passengers escape. He was in the area meaning to get a haircut and kicked the bus door three times before managing to break it open. ""All the people were at the back trying to get out of the bus but they couldn't get out the front because of the flames,"" he told the Courier-Mail newspaper. ""They couldn't open the back door so I kicked it down and they all came running out. ""It was one of the two: you get the people out or they're going to die."" Mr Nyok said there were three children among the passengers. Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said it was ""a very, very sad day for the council and the wider community"".

I am glad that he didn't lose a leg or anything, but still, that would have been very scary.  All of the sudden, boom, you are hit by a shark.  I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.  I don't think it is really our place to force sharks away, as they live in the water.  I think people just need to be smart and surf where there is a very low chance of being attacked by a shark.	fear	2.0	6.0	1.0	34.0	6000.0	7.0	3.0	1.0	7.0	3.5	3.143	4.2860000000000005	4.0	5.0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	121	617	0.1290322580645161	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.2258064516129032	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.1764705882352941	2.6358070123827044	2.647115545367129	low	low	An essay written by a 34.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 6000.0$.

But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless. It seems that no matter how much we try to protect the environment, our effect on it is always worse than we imagine.	neutral	1.0	7.0	5.0	41.0	64000.0	6.0	6.5	4.0	4.0	5.0	3.571	2.143	3.429	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	92	1887	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.1	0.0	0.15	0.25	0.2	0.0	0.05	0.0	2.921192793306292	2.8101045912106017	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 64000.0$.

1.6666666666666667	1.75	I like polar bears but I don't really care that much about their survival or extinction.  We look at ourselves and our place in the universe as being important, and as if our time defines the universe the way it's supposed to exist.  Polar bears haven't existed for like 99.9999% of the history of the universe, and now we think it's some travesty that they won't exist in the future.  This is incredibly arrogant and self-centered thinking that I think is silly.  I guess I'd rather have a world with polar bears.  But I also largely don't care.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	98	2002	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.2307692307692307	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0	2.445989900928121	2.395568712059473	low	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

4.0	3.25	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.	neutral/sadness	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	147	2135	0.1904761904761904	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0476190476190476	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.238095238095238	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.6784079571859336	2.673278459415617	medium	medium	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

2.833	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2.0	5.0	1.0	61.0	16000.0	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	134	610	0.0697674418604651	0.0232558139534883	0.0697674418604651	0.1627906976744186	0.0232558139534883	0.3255813953488372	0.1395348837209302	0.0930232558139534	0.0	0.0930232558139534	0.0	2.996345194378589	2.8483621426384267	low	low	An essay written by a 61.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 16000.0$.

I think by the time our next Presidential election comes around we will be no longer be considered a destination country but anyone in the know. I don't see why this particular stat isn't a matter of culture though. I haven't met many women who expressed an interest in STEM and most of them didn't even want to talk to people who were into it when I was in college. Now women might be more interested but it still isn't going to be anything approaching equal because the culture doesn't work that way.	neutral	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	112	418	0.0952380952380952	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.0952380952380952	0.3333333333333333	0.0476190476190476	0.1428571428571428	0.0476190476190476	0.0952380952380952	0.0	2.4433770194131217	2.38452346108504	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.

We should learn to recognize that as a society, we must come to understand the universal nature of suffering as applicable to all people.

Van Niekerk said they were called last weekend to assist a ranger who had caught a poacher near Sabi river. “My colleagues and I, with four Mozambican police officers, were transporting the poacher to the station, which was about 30km away, when he escaped from the vehicle. I chased after the poacher and caught him. I handed him back to the police officer. Suddenly, a mob from the community started moving towards us,” said Van Niekerk. The police officers who were with them ran away. “We, the rangers, were the targets.	neutral	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	106	270	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0	0.3181818181818182	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.9782039420410413	2.8460185325725846	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns.

4.167	4.875	I just read on a news paper about a situation in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka about their water situations. They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed.

In one brief moment the world goes from visible to invisible in an instant.  It's got to be nearly traumatic (although she seems to be remaining upbeat).  But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened.  Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings.  I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted.  If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected.

4.833	5.625	Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.	anger	1.0	7.0	1.0	47.0	54000.0	3.5	6.0	2.0	4.0	4.0	3.286	2.857	3.857	2.857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	106	57	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.1111111111111111	0.0555555555555555	0.3888888888888889	0.1666666666666666	0.0555555555555555	0.0555555555555555	0.0	0.0	2.359281692465013	2.461977927982167	low	low	An essay written by a 47.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 54000.0$.

They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around. To date, the world has a total of 30.1 million km2, or around 20 percent of the world’s land area, that remain as wilderness, with the majority being located in countries in North America, North Asia, Australia and Nort	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	130	648	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	2.7576904942460643	2.5433314487504117	low	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

A Category 5 has intense maximum winds of 230 miles per hour, and is being called the strongest storm of the year. There were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course electricity is out for large numbers of residents. The storm may intensify as it heads toward China and is being monitored. What a tragedy could unfold if it makes a direct hit on some of the highly populated areas in China.

Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	103	602	0.05	0.05	0.15	0.15	0.05	0.3	0.05	0.0	0.05	0.15	0.1578947368421052	2.808354938543694	2.7133308782499603	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

I think that the Mayor of Sacramento is blessed that's all that happened to him. Yes he may be upset and a little shaken, but he still gets to go home to his family and enjoy his wealth. He doesn't lose his job and he isn't majorly damaged.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them. Unfortunately, it's very sad to say, that even if a citizen is innocent, if they don't cooperate to the fullest, the police can physically harm them, even possibly lead to being shot and killed. This is very scary!

It's not fair, especially to the animals, since they don't really benefit from the coal mining.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	36.0	105000.0	6.5	5.0	1.0	6.0	5.0	5.0	4.2860000000000005	3.714	4.2860000000000005	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	68	384	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.375	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0	0.0	3.2447155995711814	3.0706400345210363	medium	low	An essay written by a 36.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 105000.0$.

3.667	4.625	This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	anger	1.0	7.0	5.0	37.0	30000.0	3.0	5.5	3.5	3.5	5.0	2.0	2.714	3.286	2.714	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	135	415	0.1142857142857142	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.2571428571428571	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.1428571428571428	0.0857142857142857	0.0285714285714285	0.0285714285714285	0.0	2.89147696956344	2.831481613946617	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

2.833	4.75	So the FBI seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a suspect. Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person. The nightclub attack in Orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the FBI did their job. They had warnings from the killers family and basically a warning from the terrorist himself. With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens. I feel like the FBI is just making excuses because they were incompetent and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too.

It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis. I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of. I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists. It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	136	281	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0	0.1818181818181818	0.3181818181818182	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.0454545454545454	0.0	2.708428565205371	2.689503862735212	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'""

Unfortunately we as a nation need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment.  Even worse is now we have a president who in his own words feel as though global warming is just a fabrication.  This is going to cost us more money in the fire fighting department and we are going to see way worse side affects from this problem.	sadness	2.0	3.0	1.0	24.0	50000.0	6.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.714	3.714	4.857	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	96	226	0.1481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.1481481481481481	0.074074074074074	0.1111111111111111	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.037037037037037	0.0	3.0072353416427293	3.012059407467874	low	medium	An essay written by a 24.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 50000.0$.

On the other hand a victim's situation will not be improved or reversed because their perpetrator has been harmed in the same way.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	37.0	72000.0	7.0	7.0	4.5	7.0	7.0	4.2860000000000005	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	67	1230	0.1785714285714285	0.1785714285714285	0.0714285714285714	0.0357142857142857	0.0357142857142857	0.0714285714285714	0.1785714285714285	0.1071428571428571	0.1071428571428571	0.0357142857142857	0.0833333333333333	2.607597671774005	2.7896595154919823	low	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 72000.0$.

Relief is being distributed better than after the last hurricane since the capital city was less affected and learnings from the previous situation were used to make some improvements. But getting food and water purification tablets distributed, and fairly, is a big problem. People are crazed with hunger and become violent, or give in to despair. Cholera is revving up. These are the immediate problems, but shelter, long-term rebuilding, voting in the upcoming election, and other issues lurk too.

4.167	4.875	I just read an article about women encouraging other women to get IUD's before Trump took office. They were worried that trump in office will restrict women's access to affordable birth control. They think because the IUD can last for so long that women should get them in soon. I don't think these women need to be out getting IUD's, there are other ways to prevent pregnancy. If they are really concerned, condoms work well.	fear	2.0	5.0	1.0	30.0	55000.0	6.0	5.5	1.5	6.5	4.0	3.286	3.571	3.143	3.857	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	75	249	0.1875	0.0	0.125	0.0625	0.0625	0.0625	0.1875	0.1875	0.0625	0.0625	0.0	2.6344320442312887	2.6159840275985844	low	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 55000.0$.

In a scolding tone, Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not use. Gingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clinton’s sex life, as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern. Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate. Voters, meanwhile, punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach: The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, which led to Gingrich’s resignation as speaker.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	30000.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	4.5	3.143	3.571	3.714	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	134	178	0.1363636363636363	0.1363636363636363	0.0909090909090909	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.1136363636363636	0.2272727272727272	0.0681818181818181	0.0454545454545454	0.0681818181818181	0.0	2.785486744528988	2.734192949674956	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 30000.0$.

Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	32.0	50000.0	6.0	5.0	1.5	5.0	5.0	3.571	3.143	3.286	4.143	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	141	71	0.0816326530612244	0.0612244897959183	0.1224489795918367	0.0408163265306122	0.0408163265306122	0.1836734693877551	0.1836734693877551	0.1224489795918367	0.1020408163265306	0.0612244897959183	0.0	3.0285871533558426	2.8316937818455035	medium	low	An essay written by a 32.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 50000.0$.

There was an interview with one of the people on the train and they said that the train started to rock back and forth and it wouldn't stop. That must have been terrifying. It makes me not want to travel by train, even though I now these types of events are rare.

This could mean that you eventually lose your hearing. Tinnitus is a common thing to experience and usually is nothing. But sometimes this can be an early sign that you could lose your hearing. I strongly encourage people to go and get this checked if they experience frequently and definitely educate yourself on it.	neutral	1.0	4.0	1.0	25.0	50000.0	5.0	6.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	2.857	3.143	3.0	2.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	84	914	0.1666666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0416666666666666	0.0833333333333333	0.125	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.0	2.925540185694296	2.7364630801939853	medium	medium	An essay written by a 25.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 50000.0$.

The situation is deeply troubling as these majestic creatures endure suffering and loss of life due to the reduced duration of ice cover.

Sometimes the articles have so many names of places I don't recognize and can't pronounce that I get a little off track of the point of the article. I gues those terrorists are using people as human shields to keep and take control or surroundings areas. They know this is against UN policy, but I doubt they care. There is always something going on in the Middle East, it seems nothing gets better for the people just trying to live. I feel like something should be done to improve the situation, but it's been bad since I was a kid and I doubt it'll get better.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	42.0	70500.0	6.0	2.0	2.5	4.0	4.0	3.143	3.143	3.429	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	118	331	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.1578947368421052	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.0526315789473684	0.0588235294117647	2.51010399368267	2.339573797015446	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 70500.0$.

5.0	3.125	I find myself in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed in this article. It has shed light on a perspective that had not previously crossed my mind: the abundance of young minds in places like zzos and theme parks who should not be exposed to smoking. In my opinion, cigarettes should be treated similarly to alcohol, with restrictions on public consumption. When children witness others smoking, they internalize it as the norm and socially acceptable behavior. By shielding the current generation from such influences, we can lay the foundation for them to make better choices and prioritize their health in the future. The proposed ban holds a real possibility of reducing the number of potential new smokers and eradicating the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I wholeheartedly support this ban and believe it will have no negative consequences if implemented.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	142	2268	0.0	0.0	0.1481481481481481	0.1481481481481481	0.037037037037037	0.2962962962962963	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.074074074074074	0.0344827586206896	2.568658326668702	2.509329733274858	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I doubt after moving to multiple houses that you would not have noticed something was off. I mean you never went into these closets? The biggest issue here though is that this woman thought she would rid herself of a problem because of social services checking in on her. It is disgusting. I am surprised the other kids survived. They all must have lived in fear of this lady. Makes me so mad people kill kids.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	40.0	31000.0	6.0	4.5	1.0	7.0	5.0	3.714	2.286	4.0	4.2860000000000005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	99	645	0.2222222222222222	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.0	0.2592592592592592	0.1851851851851851	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.0	2.6015044632467426	2.786645121202002	low	medium	An essay written by a 40.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 31000.0$.

And now we have to worry about when our men and women go out to train, that this kind of thing can end of happening at the drop of a hat. So, who is responsible after this? Who helps the children now without parents? Who pays for everything surrounding their funerals, and all of the costs after that?	sadness	2.0	5.0	1.0	37.0	29999.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.714	4.143	5.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	85	173	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.1428571428571428	0.0	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.1428571428571428	0.0714285714285714	0.0714285714285714	0.0	2.859666996591129	2.9911472751221986	low	medium	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white female, with a two year associate degree, with an income of 29999.0$.

7.0	7.0	"Though all people who flee conflict can be called refugees, refugee agencies commonly distinguish between refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) to decide who is covered by international law and receives assistance and who doesn't. For the most part, little assistance reaches a person fleeing a conflict until he or she crosses an international border. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, distinguishes refugees and IDPs this way: ""When a fleeing civilian crosses an international frontier, he or she becomes a refugee and as such is eligible to receive international protection and help.

I know we always or mostly mean well but this story amply displayed how when we interfere with natural order of things even with the best of intentions, we can make the matters worse.

4.5	5.0	Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting. Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock. His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.	joy	1.0	7.0	2.0	30.0	60000.0	4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	3.571	3.714	2.714	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	116	272	0.0666666666666666	0.0888888888888888	0.0888888888888888	0.0666666666666666	0.0444444444444444	0.2222222222222222	0.1333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1555555555555555	0.05	2.757041547056588	2.389435536663511	medium	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old hispanic or latino male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 60000.0$.

5.667000000000001	5.625	The dwindling wilderness is due, in part to humanity’s activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and of course, oil and gas exploration. The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around.	neutral	1.0	6.0	3.0	30.0	35000.0	4.0	3.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	3.429	3.571	3.429	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	113	647	0.1578947368421052	0.0526315789473684	0.1052631578947368	0.131578947368421	0.0	0.1842105263157894	0.1052631578947368	0.2105263157894736	0.0	0.0526315789473684	0.0	3.009758951199248	2.78106625686191	medium	medium	An essay written by a 30.0 years old black or african american male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 35000.0$.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

I try to put myself in their position, and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable solution. If it would be more beneficial to relocate to another area, where I can then begin to rebuild my life, and replace that which was destroyed. However there is an underlying disadvantage to Louisiana, as a whole, if in the case so many would want to leave and relocate. The State is in a very difficult and decisive moment, given what they are faced with. Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	neutral	2.0	4.0	1.0	33.0	60000.0	7.0	7.0	5.5	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.429	3.571	5.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	140	938	0.2272727272727272	0.1363636363636363	0.0	0.0	0.0909090909090909	0.0909090909090909	0.1818181818181818	0.2272727272727272	0.0454545454545454	0.0	0.0	2.989516443242618	2.723153047494177	medium	low	An essay written by a 33.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 60000.0$.

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.	anger	1.0	4.0	1.0	42.0	39000.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.571	3.0	4.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	120	603	0.1282051282051282	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.1025641025641025	0.0512820512820512	0.1282051282051282	0.1794871794871795	0.0512820512820512	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0952380952380952	2.815790696511404	2.725291653693128	low	low	An essay written by a 42.0 years old white male, went to college, with an income of 39000.0$.

A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason.

The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward.

Further more, it is an ideology that promotes violence and terrorism. Until people become less tolerant of this disgusting dogma, things like this will continue to happen. If muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west, they need to work on reforming their religion from within.	sadness	2.0	4.0	1.0	31.0	24000.0	4.5	6.0	2.0	4.5	2.5	3.286	3.143	2.4290000000000003	2.0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	80	306	0.1538461538461538	0.1153846153846153	0.0769230769230769	0.1538461538461538	0.0	0.1923076923076923	0.1538461538461538	0.0769230769230769	0.0769230769230769	0.0	0.0	2.878356035645947	2.8620711569571	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white female, went to college, with an income of 24000.0$.

You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

5.0	3.125	This article is something i can really agree with. I had never thought of how places like zzos and themeparks are abundant with little minds that should not be subject to smoking. I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	128	2157	0.0666666666666666	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.0666666666666666	0.4	0.2	0.0	0.0	0.0666666666666666	0.0	2.681165264634731	2.6242989345013825	low	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

I mean here is someone who was bold enough to ask for help yet no one reached out to help. I feel so bad knowing this. Depression is real and hit even the most unsuspecting people. It is so bad that she died without anyone showing her true love.	neutral	1.0	7.0	1.0	28.0	165000.0	6.25	5.75	3.25	6.75	6.0	3.357	2.429	3.2145	3.4285	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	72	1931	0.0967741935483871	0.1290322580645161	0.032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.1935483870967742	0.1290322580645161	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.0967741935483871	0.0	2.8953135146976936	2.802490386282118	low	medium	An essay written by a 28.0 years old white male, postgradute or with a professional degree, with an income of 165000.0$.

No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating. If it was a child, however, this is insanity and just horrifying.	sadness	1.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	12000.0	5.5	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.429	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	60	82	0.1951219512195122	0.1707317073170731	0.024390243902439	0.024390243902439	0.0	0.073170731707317	0.2439024390243902	0.0975609756097561	0.1219512195121951	0.048780487804878	0.0	2.429171016767234	2.542875847623198	medium	low	An essay written by a 37.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 12000.0$.

I think people are not willing to accept that others are really shitty and that someone like Trump would be voted in. They can't see past others. People have too much faith in others, too much trust. There are a lot of vile people out there, just gotta encourage them a little bit and they'll come out. Trump was their encouragement. What will the liberals do now? I don't know. Sometimes I think we will be okay, sometimes I think we won't. I just know that going to one march is going to do shit. You need tens of marches, packed to the brim. You need them every weekend. For months. You need to call your officials, complain, elect them, vote them out. Do more.

1.0	1.25	This story specifically doesn't make me feel anything, since I don't know these people and I feel like if I tried to have emotions for every victim of a crime I read about that would just require too much mental effort. In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning. It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	anger	2.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	62000.0	7.0	4.0	1.0	2.0	4.5	2.571	1.143	2.143	1.0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	108	284	0.1290322580645161	0.1935483870967742	0.032258064516129	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.1290322580645161	0.2258064516129032	0.0967741935483871	0.064516129032258	0.032258064516129	0.0416666666666666	2.727391499030461	2.731973273702512	low	low	An essay written by a 29.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 62000.0$.

I know that bigots are not a particularly new species, but I used to think, just a few years ago, that things were much better and that people were generally becoming more open-minded and welcoming.

They are being empowered right now, and that is very disturbing.	disgust	2.0	6.0	1.0	57.0	135000.0	7.0	7.0	6.5	6.5	6.5	4.857	1.571	4.428999999999999	4.571000000000001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	72	653	0.125	0.0	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.25	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.0	2.5458879751427843	2.5068474056838426	low	low	An essay written by a 57.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 135000.0$.

The man was very well know and successful and look what happened to him he wound up dead just like everyone else.  Now,  the conclusion is that it was an accident,  but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of speculation.

4.667	6.625	I don't really like coconuts, I think everyone knows that, but I still think that they play a huge role in our ecosystem. I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis. It just makes me worried about the environment overall because I really worry about global warming and I just really worry about the environment in general.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	143	458	0.0833333333333333	0.0416666666666666	0.125	0.125	0.0416666666666666	0.2083333333333333	0.2083333333333333	0.125	0.0	0.0416666666666666	0.0344827586206896	2.758468311453905	2.5576228803693977	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

4.167	4.5	I think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma.  Some people die with less pain, and we tend to call them lucky.  I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	neutral	1.0	3.0	1.0	30.0	8700.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	5.0	6.0	3.571	2.571	3.429	3.0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	120	1339	0.18	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.04	0.1	0.2	0.2	0.08	0.02	0.0	3.075275337141929	2.907461098664972	high	low	An essay written by a 30.0 years old white male, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 8700.0$.

I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly family members behind in a war. It's unimaginable. And to make matters worse, there is hardly any food for them in their homes. They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas.

For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.

It delved into the challenges faced by polar bears, specifically pertaining to the increasingly shorter ice seasons that have emerged in recent times. The implications of this issue are truly disheartening, as these remarkable creatures suffer and perish due to the reduced span of ice coverage. I sincerely yearn for scientists to promptly discover a resolution to this pressing concern.	hope/neutral	1.0	2.0	5.0	29.0	44000.0	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	74	2262	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.2666666666666666	0.1333333333333333	0.0	0.1333333333333333	0.0	2.730137458211884	2.668720776567388	medium	medium	An essay written by a 29.0 years old asian/pacific islander male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 44000.0$.

4.0	4.0	I am writing as regards my thoughts for Polar bears, the poster-child for climate change, are among the animals most affected by the seasonal and year-to-year changes in Arctic sea ice, because they rely on this surface for essential activities such as hunting, traveling and breeding. The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status.

If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.  It reduces the empathy and sympathy I feel when I read a story like this.	neutral	1.0	6.0	1.0	41.0	28000.0	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	122	1895	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.0333333333333333	0.1	0.0666666666666666	0.2333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.1	0.0333333333333333	0.1333333333333333	0.0	2.559992804550566	2.57964186199379	medium	low	An essay written by a 41.0 years old white male, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 28000.0$.

5.0	3.125	This article resonates strongly with me, as it introduces a perspective I wholeheartedly endorse. It hadn't occurred to me before how locations like zzos and theme parks can be teeming with young individuals who should not be exposed to smoking. I believe that treating cigarettes similarly to alcohol, where public consumption is not allowed, is a sensible approach. When children observe others smoking, they perceive it as the norm and acceptable behavior. Shielding this generation from such influences can empower them to make better choices in the future and lead healthier lives. By implementing this proposed ban, we have a genuine opportunity to decrease the number of potential new smokers and eliminate the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am fully supportive of this ban and see no negative repercussions from its enforcement.	hope/neutral	2.0	3.0	1.0	27.0	25000.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	135	2267	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.1111111111111111	0.037037037037037	0.4074074074074074	0.2222222222222222	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	0.037037037037037	2.601544240108423	2.6075093429763534	medium	low	An essay written by a 27.0 years old white female, went to a technical/vocational school, with an income of 25000.0$.

The zoo wasn't even targeted in attacks on the area.

1.6669999999999998	6.125	I just read the article and I am so surprised that this happened. I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.	sadness	2.0	6.0	1.0	26.0	49000.0	7.0	6.5	5.5	6.0	6.5	4.714	3.0	5.0	4.428999999999999	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	149	455	0.2068965517241379	0.0689655172413793	0.0344827586206896	0.1034482758620689	0.0344827586206896	0.1379310344827586	0.2068965517241379	0.1379310344827586	0.0344827586206896	0.0344827586206896	0.0	2.785816318850275	2.7220543145719054	low	low	An essay written by a 26.0 years old white female, with a four year bachelor's degree, with an income of 49000.0$.

They seemed relatively happy on the exterior.

All over a declined card this man got so upset that he had to take it out on other people. It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go.

These people have broken the law and are here illegally yet they expect to be treated just like US citizens.  DACA is a slap in the face to those immigrants who followed the law and went through the process to become legal citizens.

These people must learn how to live with the elephants, but it seems like it is a scary thing to do.  I would hate to try and live in that situation with children.

1.0	1.0	If people are concerned about others to where they feel fear. They need to leave the situation entirely. No working things out, no seeing what happens. If you feel threatened, LEAVE! The problem is most people think they can't just drop everything. But it's mostly because they either don't know how, or don't want to live any other lesser lifestyle than they are accustomed to. Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out. We are free to make our own choices, and live the life we can live. So why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened, when they can just leave, and disappear. Even if you have no where to go, you can always die.	neutral	1.0	2.0	1.0	31.0	16000.0	4.5	5.5	5.5	6.0	7.0	3.571	1.429	2.857	3.857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	151	543	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0909090909090909	0.0606060606060606	0.2424242424242424	0.1818181818181818	0.0606060606060606	0.0303030303030303	0.0434782608695652	2.7123863054074224	2.593865645376162	medium	low	An essay written by a 31.0 years old white male, with a high school diploma, with an income of 16000.0$.
